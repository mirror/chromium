      "message": "Using Bytes() causes hash values can be different depending on whether the string is represented in a 8-bit or 16-bit buffer.\n\nProbably practically this is not a problem, because a string with 8-bit characters only are expected to be represented in a 8-bit buffer, and returning different hash values for 8-bit and 16-bit versions of the same string content doesn\u0027t affect the correctness in this case.\n\nHowever, I feel it\u0027s better to make this independent from the 8-bit/16-bit representations inside StringImpl and not to expose String::Bytes().\n(Perhaps we can do similar things to what is done by StringHash, but I\u0027m not familiar with how StringHash is implemented.)",
