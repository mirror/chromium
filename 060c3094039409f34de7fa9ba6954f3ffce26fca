      "message": "Unfortunately our WPT bots do not support this syntax atm. In fact, we only support the minimal one-email-per-line syntax and ignore everything else.\n\nHow useful do you think the full syntax support would be? Can you file a bug (feature request) for that? It is non-trivial to support all the syntax, and the best way would be to invoke depot_tools instead of reinventing the wheel.\n\nFor now, I think you can either copy the content from the referenced file, or follow some existing examples in external/wpt to use their team alias instead.",
