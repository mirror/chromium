I\u0027m not really sure.\n\nWould it work to inject MockTimers into the class?\n\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/base/timer/mock_timer.h?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d12\n\nI think you would need to switch the type of the timers from OneShotTimer to Timer, which is a readability lose, but it might make the test code simpler.\n\nWDYT?",
