      "message": "Yes, now DisplayItemList methods only define where a range starts/ends, not how many elements will be in the ranges, which is what this is testing for a FilterDisplayItem. So other tests that do a StartPaint/EndPaintOfPairedBegin and count the ops duplicate this, and there\u0027s no need to do something specific for filters as there\u0027s no different code in DisplayItemList for them. DisplayItemListTest.SizeMultiple should cover this.",

      "message": "Yep! These are covered in PaintOpBuffer tests now. I added a bunch of new ones when I added PaintOpBuffer::PlaybackRanges recently, tho there were some there already. They make sure that these optimizations work in more scenarios than we do here, where they can be across ranges now.\n\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/507047/16/cc/paint/paint_op_buffer_unittest.cc adds those tests.\n\nHere was an existing simple parallel for this test: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/paint/paint_op_buffer_unittest.cc?rcl\u003dc8e2b27f71c6792fa1072fa98a22c111ad229090\u0026l\u003d240\n\nAnd some more complex ones: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/paint/paint_op_buffer_unittest.cc?rcl\u003dc8e2b27f71c6792fa1072fa98a22c111ad229090\u0026l\u003d697",
