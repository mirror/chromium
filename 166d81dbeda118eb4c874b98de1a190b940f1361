      "message": "There was a comment about paying a penalty for unaligned access. From an algorithm-level, these should support unaligned access.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if the current platforms have a terrible unaligned access penalty. We might have moved into the realm of memory-speed-bound where a small penalty won\u0027t make a difference. I don\u0027t think any of them would fault.\n\nIf we want to align things (better safe than sorry), we could easily do:\nloads -- 1-byte loads in a loop (since the loads happen less. I think this is what Mike suggested)\nstores -- something like loop unrolling setup: a switch over the offset to fill the non-aligned values and then phase shift so instead of filling \"abababab\" it could fill unaligned \"a\" and continue filling \"babababa\" (overfilling an extra \"a\" at the end).",
