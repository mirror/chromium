      "message": "As it currently stands, this is unreachable, since EnumTraits doesn\u0027t actually map this value. At the same time, I guess this is needed to suppress a clang warning... so maybe it\u0027s fine (and it\u0027s more resistant to a hypothetical time in the future where we only use the mojo enum).",

      "message": "And, if we ever decide to provide I420_PLANES results to clients in other processes, it just means adding a little extra struct traits impl. However, I don\u0027t want to encourage that, since using I420 image format implies a video use case (usually), and I wouldn\u0027t want people re-inventing the wheel for that.",
