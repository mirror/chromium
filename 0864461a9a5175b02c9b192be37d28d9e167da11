      "message": "Theresa: the problem here, was that TextBubble#setAnchorRect expects position in screen (i.e absolute), and I was passing the location relative to the Activity. The height difference was because of the status bar.\n\nIf the panel was a view attached to the view hierarchy, I could\u0027ve called View#getLocationOnScreen. But since it isn\u0027t, I\u0027ve used the Window object to get the visible Rect. To be honest, this doesn\u0027t look very clean to me, but I didn\u0027t know of a better way to do it.",
