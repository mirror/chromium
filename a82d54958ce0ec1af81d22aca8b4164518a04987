      "message": "The original test has four subscribers. 1 subscribed to all devices, and 3 that subscribe each to one different device type.\n\nThe new version of the test only has the latter 3 and simulates the events 3 times. Please rewrite to match the original test with 4 subscribers.\n\nAlso, no need to simulate the device changes inside a loop. You just need four MockMediaDevicesListener variables like the original test, and a single round of device-change simulations as in the original test.\n\nThe reason to have the test that way is that it is similar to having one subscriber like MediaDevices (subscribes to everything) and 3 subscribers for each event type (like Pepper).",
