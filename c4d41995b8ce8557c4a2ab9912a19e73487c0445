I think it should probably take the log base as a parameter, since it seems like not everything would want to use 1.3 (and you might want to mention that number in the metric description).\n\nI think it\u0027s probably fine to not static-const the log of the base, since it shouldn\u0027t be that expensive, or alternatively you could maybe take it as a template parameter.",
