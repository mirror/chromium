The caller is basically hijacking the logic that\u0027s used to split a write (or read) over multiple child entries to also just scan over ranges and find one ---- there isn\u0027t even a buffer for buff_len_ to correspond to, and the intermediate result updates are useless,\nsince this will set result_ itself.\n\nIt\u0027s kind of a stretch of a fit, and probably pointless since unlike other ops this isn\u0027t split up into async pieces....

Hmm, though maybe I am underestimating the impact of this; the weird write pattern that triggers this was toggled by the video code, and it does essentially potentially inject a weird error code in an odd spot of the state machine...\n\n(definitely not a regression, though...)",
