      "message": "When I attempted to switch ResourceRequest to be used with unique_ptr, I encountered the DISALLOW_NEW().\n\nThe DISALLOW_NEW() for this class was added by tasak@ in the following CL:\nhttps://codereview.chromium.org/1511493002/\n(originally https://codereview.chromium.org/1511493002)\n\nThey wanted to switch things to use PartitionAlloc than system allocator where possible. For some reason, tasak@ replaced USING_FAST_MALLOC() with DISALLOW_NEW().\n\nTakashi and I checked with haraken@. The only case he mentioned where DISALLOW_NEW() is needed is when we have a non-GC-ed class with GC-ed class(es) as its member. Such a non-GC-ed class is intended to be used as a member of a GC-ed class. It must not be new-ed.\n\nI think we can just switch it back to use USING_FAST_MALLOC(). It\u0027s still good to include tasak@ in the R\u003d line.",
