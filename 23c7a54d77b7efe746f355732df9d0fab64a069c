Since it\u0027s FYI, it\u0027s probably OK (except possibly for some confused developers), but ideally we should add a new config, restart the master, then remove the old config in another CL, to avoid downtime.\n\nAgain, this time it\u0027s probably OK to do it all at once, because it\u0027s FYI.",
