      "message": "I am actually a bit confused by this comment.\n\nThe client requests a LocalSurfaceId from the parent, right? The client perhaps allocates the Surface, but it doesn\u0027t allocate the identifier? Maybe I am misunderstanding.\n\nDo you have a suggestion for a better comment? Maybe something like \"An identifier allocated by the parent ...\" That would leave room for us to add the child_id and a comment describing how the child_id is allocated by the child.",
