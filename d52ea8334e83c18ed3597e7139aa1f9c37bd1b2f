      "message": "If the event-\u003etarget() is set, and it\u0027s not the active window, should we abort processing the window?\n\nAlternatively, should this attempt to activate |event-\u003etarget()| instead first, before dispatching the event to it?\n\nOr, if event-\u003etarget() is set, should we dispatch to its root-window, instead of the \u0027active root window\u0027? The comment above (lines 806:808) seems to imply the exact root-window we select here is not particularly relevant. If selecting |event-\u003etarget()-\u003eGetRootWindow()| here fixes the crash, maybe we can do that instead?",
