      "message": "Sure, if this is the only test with that problematic assumption, and it\u0027s too much work to figure out how to rewrite it, then excluding it from this CL and keeping it in LayoutTests would be fine.\n\nGoing just by the test description, it sounds like maybe you could assert_equals(getComputedStyle(dialog).top, \u0027auto\u0027) before showModal, and then assert_not_equals after. That way you don\u0027t have to assert the exact values.",
