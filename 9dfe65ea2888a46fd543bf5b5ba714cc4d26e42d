My understanding is that a non-async tests are for cases where the test can complete in the load handler, like this. async_test is for tests that need to do something after load (e.g. requestAnimationFrame, event listeners, etc). It should be fairly straightforward to convert to non-async so I\u0027d suggest trying that but if you\u0027re still having issues and it\u0027s drawing too much time this is fine too.",
