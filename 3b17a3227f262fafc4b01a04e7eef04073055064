That\u0027s how I know all the values you\u0027re getting are actually recorded in the UMA histogram code in the client as a 0.  If the client logged them as a 4, the dashboard would display them as a 4.\n\n(Did you read the message I wrote on this comment thread starting with \"I don\u0027t understand how this solves your problem.\"?)",
