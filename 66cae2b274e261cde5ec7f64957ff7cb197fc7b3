When will this start affecting users of this API, and is there a migration plan for them?  Or is this to ensure that we don\u0027t forget to migrate them, or that they have a certain configuration set?",

I don\u0027t know where the bot/waterfall is that runs it but this makes the crash stack that would occur if we tried to flip the switch more self-documenting. For the reasons mentioned on the bug, I\u0027d rather get rid of this API than to bend over backwards to accommodate it, but I don\u0027t yet know what we\u0027ll do with it.",
