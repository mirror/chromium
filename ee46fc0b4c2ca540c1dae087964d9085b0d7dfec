      "message": "These are all excellent class descriptions (and should probably be moved to the class headers), but I worry they don\u0027t help understand animation worklet at a high level. We should probably use this file to explain how AnimationWorklet is an animation and how it gets updated, maybe have sections for the lifetime / interaction / creation of objects / how the compositor gets the client with which to get updates from the animators.\n\nFor example, if you look at the layout README https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/layout/README.md?q\u003dwebkit%5C/Source%5C/.*%5C/README%5C.md\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr it talks about how layout works and explains various layout concepts.",
