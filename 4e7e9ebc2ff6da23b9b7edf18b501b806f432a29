They didn\u0027t think it was a good idea to make the getters public as-is, so we decided to add public copies with scarier names.\n\nApparently generating the public parts won\u0027t just slot into the existing generator - I\u0027d have to do extra work to set it up.",

However it creates a negative that\u0027s confusing.\n\nWhat about BackgroundColorVisitedOnly/BackgroundColorUnvisitedOnly or BackgroundColorRawVisited/BackgroundColorRawUnvisited?\n\nDo you think VisitedLinkBackgroundColor is explicit enough that I can just make those ones public and only make copies of the unvisited ones?\n\nI\u0027ll add Naina and Darren so they can bikeshed with us :P",
