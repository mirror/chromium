      "message": "Should we just be calling saveTabListAsynchronously here?\n\nOne thing we could do is actually expose a method on this class (that basically is the contents of the ChromeTabbedActivity method) that would call the save at the end.  With this, we\u0027ll be calling this in quick succession for all the tabs being removed, so optimize that slightly by only doing it once at the end.\n\nThis optimization could be a TODO as well.",

I think we could remove the launch type checks altogether and do:\n\nmIsDetached \u003d getActivity() \u003d\u003d null;\n\nAnytime you don\u0027t have an activity associated with your window android, you are detached.\n\nAs a separate CL, I think we should rename FROM_DETACHED to better reflect it\u0027s general use (FROM_SPECULATIVE_BACKGROUND_CREATION or something).  FROM_DETACHED is too conflated with reparenting IMO and we should make that clearer.",

      "message": "Like we discussed offline, isDetached should never be a developer set state here but should always depend on the ability to link this construction to a live ChromeActivity.\n\nYou are giving a WindowAndroid here. Right now you can give a base class WindowAndroid with no Activity (nativeWindow.getActivity() returns null) and set isDetached to false which will be very confusing.\n\nThat state should only be set through the availability of an Activity. Here what happens if we set\n\n\ntab.mIsDetached \u003d nativeWindow.getActivity() \u003d\u003d null;\n\nDoes it work for all old and new use cases of this constructor?",
