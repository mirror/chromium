In case ARC OptOut, Playstore is not available and user would not have access to search .\n\nFYI IsWebstoreSearchEnabled is bad utility that does not take into the consideration many cases. For example we have ARC builds without Play Store support at all. Next case if user is managed and ARC is forced to off. In many cases we leave user without access to search. I think these cases need to be discussed.",

      "message": "Hi, I can give a little background here. \nIn UI review we decided to remove Webstore completely from ChromeOS as its deprecated and we do not want to promote installation of deprecated apps (while admins can still install via policy).\n\nThen we looked at older devices that will never get ARC++ no matter what, and we decided that in those cases we can keep the Webstore available just to give *consumer* users more options. Of course, admins can always decide to do things like disable Webstore/Arc++/etc. That\u0027s up to the admin and it should be that way.\n\nSo the logic we are pursuing is to disable Webstore on all devices that might get ARC++ within the next 8 months.",

      "message": "Thanks for raising these issues. For the Play Books app, and Play Music (Internal links: go/chrome_deprecated_apps) they seem nothing but URL-wrapper apps. The play movies app seem to be a bit more involved. I will try to reach out to the owners of these apps and inform them about those decisions.\n\nIsWebstoreSearchEnabled() checks the command line argument for an option \"arc-availability\" https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/arc/arc_util.cc?type\u003dcs\u0026q\u003dIsWebstoreSearchEnabled\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d79\nSo I think this should be set for the device and should not be changeable (Unless user goes to /etc/chrome_dev.conf and adds an entry for it, but that\u0027s only available in dev mode devices and require someone who knows what he\u0027s doing). So in short the device either has ARC or not. If it has ARC, we don\u0027t want the chrome apps as we replaced them by their android counterparts.",
