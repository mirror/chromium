      "message": "Why does this need to be a unique_ptr instead of a member by value?  It seems like the functional change in this CL is to convert LinearAnimation to FaviconCrashAnimation, but most of the changed lines have to do with this introduction of a unique_ptr, which is set in the constructor and never deleted AFAICT.",

      "message": "(I restored it to the old way of doing things.) FaviconCrashAnimation is only forward declared in this file so to make it a value member we\u0027d have to add a complete declaration here. I favor not doing so because IMO a small class like that is easier to digest when it\u0027s all in one place, and I like to keep the header as minimal as possible (which is sort of a lost cause in this case, I suppose).",
