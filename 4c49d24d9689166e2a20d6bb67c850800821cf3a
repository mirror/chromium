      "message": "Why does this need to be a unique_ptr instead of a member by value?  It seems like the functional change in this CL is to convert LinearAnimation to FaviconCrashAnimation, but most of the changed lines have to do with this introduction of a unique_ptr, which is set in the constructor and never deleted AFAICT.",

      "message": "(I restored it to the old way of doing things.) FaviconCrashAnimation is only forward declared in this file so to make it a value member we\u0027d have to add a complete declaration here. I favor not doing so because IMO a small class like that is easier to digest when it\u0027s all in one place, and I like to keep the header as minimal as possible (which is sort of a lost cause in this case, I suppose).",

      "message": "I like the idea of not declaring FaviconCrashAnimation in this file, but using a unique_ptr when something is most analogous to a member-by-value is a bit misleading (it implied to me that the lifetime was different than it was) and it\u0027s sort of going against our team style guide: \"If it would otherwise make sense to use a type as a member by-value, don\u0027t convert it to a pointer just to be able to forward-declare the type.\" ( https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/styleguide/c++/c++.md#forward-declarations-vs_includes ).\n\nMaybe we could pull the class out to its own (small) .h/.cc and #include it above?  I realize this probably feels like total overkill, but I find it kind of refreshing to run into source files that are only a few dozen lines long instead of a thousand :)",

      "message": "I agree with the sentiment and that\u0027s why I made the (mistaken) change in the first place. I don\u0027t particularly love the idea of lots of tiny source files housing code that is only used in one place (and that relies on implementation details of its singular callsite, no less). In this case I think the class can probably just go away, I can\u0027t see why it needs to exist instead of relying on a normal LinearAnimation and using AnimationDelegate. But that refactor is a bridge beyond my original intent of making the tab title slide, so I\u0027d prefer to just restore what we were doing.",
