      "message": "This is a little confusing because ProviderHost is supposed to exist for SharedWorker already, and ProviderHost IS_A ContainerHost. Is the following accurate?\n\n// For provider hosts that are hosting a service worker client associated with worker threads. These are the bindings to ServiceWorkerContainerHost used on the worker threads.\n// When this hosting a shared worker, |bindings_for_worker_| contains exactly one element: the shared worker itself. This binding is needed because |this| can only be used from the main thread.\n// When this is hosting a document, |bindings_for_worker_| contains all dedicated workers associated with the document. This binding is needed because we don\u0027t yet create provider hosts for dedicated workers.\n\nMaybe |bindings_for_worker_threads| is a better name?",
