      "message": "This is now an integration test and not a unit test anymore. In your previous CL revision you used TestWebState and it was a unit test. I think it\u0027s ok to write *one* integration test for CWVAutofillController, but integration tests should not be a replacement for unit tests (because they are slow).\n\nWith this CL, let\u0027s go with a real unit test and if you want an integration test, let\u0027s land it in a separate CL. I would suggest to go back to the previous design, where various objects were injected into CRWAutofillController and the class was actually unit testable.",
