      "message": "If I build a target, and then delete the .runtime_deps file, re-running ninja doesn\u0027t create it. \n\nIs that a bug, or would you consider the file to be an ephemeral thing? If the latter, I think I probably need to feed it as input into a separate action(), so I could move the thing that creates the .runtime_deps and the .label as an action, but that seems like it\u0027ll be slower overall.",
