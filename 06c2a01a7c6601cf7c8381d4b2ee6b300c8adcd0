      "message": "This was failing in some tests where the WebContents is destroyed, causing AppBannerManager::Stop to be called, but presumably without RequestAppBanner having been called (so status_reporter_ was still null -- it\u0027s default value).  Before this CL, this DCHECK looked like:\n\nDCHECK(!need_to_log_status_ || (IsRunning() \u0026\u0026 !IsWaitingForData()));\n\nand need_to_log_status_ was false simply because that is the default value, so the aforementioned tests happened to pass.\n\nI think that guarding against a status_reporter_ being null here is reasonable and equivalent to the old behaviour.",
