      "message": "The CL desc could use more detail that you told me offline. I would\nbullet point each change done by this CL for example:\n1. RasterInvalidationTracking is converted from a struct to a class.\n2. Now each GraphicsLayer is associated with a RasterInvalidator instead\n   of a RasterInvalidationTracking. Previously the association was\n   implemented by a hash map, now is directly owned using unique_ptr.\n3. Empty invalidation rect is no longer reported in SPv2.\n\nThis makes it easier to review by verifying each change against the claims. :)",

Previously, when SetTracksRasterInvalidation() is called, we always recreated tracking_info_ causing loss of previous recorded raster under-invalidations. Now raster under-invalidations are accumulative. SetTracksRasterInvalidations(true) only clears tracked invalidations but not under-invalidation checking information.",
