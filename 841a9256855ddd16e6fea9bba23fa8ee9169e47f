      "message": "This is pretty strange in general, since you aren\u0027t removing the row that is being iterated on in all cases. Without a row.Remove method, this can be pretty ugly.\n\nWould it make more sense to do:\n\nfor (let x \u003d rows.length - 1; x \u003e 0; x--) {\n  logsTable.deleteRow(x);\n}\n\nor something similar. This way the indexing is preserved by walking down the rows instead of up.",
