      "message": "No, there\u0027s no strong need. It\u0027s not horribly broken, but it is less legible, especially the concatenated strings split onto different lines. I would have just left this as it was, ignoring the formatting warnings when uploading, but Mark reluctantly landed the \u0027git cl format\u0027 changes, and I just learned of this approach to restore some legibility. Why do you hate using those directives?",
