      "message": "So it looks that this failed on certain device types. On the example failures linked in the bug, the state was scrolling.\n\nI initially tested on an old Nexus 4 (KitKat, I think), and it never failed with the old code. I tried a Pixel (Marshmallow) where I could reproduce the bot failure ~100%.\n\nThe new code passed locally in 10+ runs across both devices.",
