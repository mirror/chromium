The only novice-level concern I have is if installing the same extension before the uninstall of the extension has completed would trip over itself.

It wouldn\u0027t wait for file deletion, which would be the more likely conflict, I think.  I think all the callback really did was add a false sense of security.  If we find that this is becoming a problem (and per-task-ordering is not sufficient), we should do a better job of waiting anyway :)",
