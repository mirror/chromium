      "message": "do you refer to this change as \u0027now\u0027?\n\nSorry, it was rushed and probably annoying. Now I see telemetry_perf_unittests failing on CQ with this patch. I did not know these metrics are used somewhere, let me take a closer look.\n\nMy point is that these metrics sound not trustworthy. StartupTimeToTimeTicks() subtracts one base::Time::Now() from another and then corrects timeticks with this delta. On Android it mixes a Java clock with a native one, which is extra broken. I am not sure how bad it is on Windows, maybe not too bad, so I don\u0027t want to touch it on this platform just yet.\n\nSpecifically on Android we never look at \u0027Startup.*\u0027 UMA, so recording them sounds unnecessary. Would it SGTY if recording based on g_browser_main_entry_point_ticks in startup_metric_utils.cc would be under if(!g_browser_main_entry_point_ticks.Get().is_null()) ?\n\nAnother way would be to record these metrics by taking the entry point(s) from java-side uptimeMillis/elapsedRealtime, but does not seem worth it to me.",
