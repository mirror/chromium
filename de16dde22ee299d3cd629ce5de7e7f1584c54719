      "message": "I put a backtrace on this to try and understand it when writing the test. The focus/click on the element triggers a layout on the layoutview from RenderViewImpl::FocusedNodeChanged(), but because the width of the table cell hasn\u0027t changed its children don\u0027t get a layout. I couldn\u0027t think of an equivalent way of achieving this, so just stuck with the click.",
