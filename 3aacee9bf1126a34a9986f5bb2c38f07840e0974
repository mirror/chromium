      "message": "I think this should be \"Promise.all([\".\n\n-- also --\n\nI like that the previous test assured that at least 1 disconnect event was received. I don\u0027t like the use of a timeout, but it did ensure there was a higher chance we\u0027d catch duplicate events.\n\nI suggest adding to the array of promises:\n  eventPromise(device, \u0027gattserverdisconnected\u0027)  // Wait until disconnect event received.\n\nThen, stick a timer after that to provide a window of time to catch the duplicates -- unless you can think of a better (and cross browser?) way.",
