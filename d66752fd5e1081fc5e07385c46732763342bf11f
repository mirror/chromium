      "message": "should this just be a name-\u003elocation dict, i.e., \n\nartifacts: {\n  \"screenshot\": \"/screenshots/page.png\"\n}?\n\nis there a reason we\u0027d want more than one of a give artifact, or support something other than just the path to the file? For non-perf-artifacts, I\u0027m pretty sure the answer is no, but I\u0027m less familiar with perf artifacts.\n\nEdit: ah, I see you want to handle N retries, which makes sense. I suggest we change that to a list of name -\u003e [file...], as I think we should change \"expected\" and \"actual\" to lists as well.\n\nThoughts?",
