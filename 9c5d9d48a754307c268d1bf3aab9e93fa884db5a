      "message": "This change is a little confusing.\n\nThe way things work is that \"response_body_stream_\" is the pipe with the response body. \n While we\u0027re trying to read data from net, we transfer ownership of the buffer to pending_write_ (It\u0027s an IOBuffer, so it needs to be able to outlive |this| on cancellation, since we could be writing to it on another thread).  The old code called pending_write_-\u003eOnComplete, which released ownership of the pipe, and since the return value (Which is a smart pointer that owns the pipe) wasn\u0027t stored anywhere, the pipe was then closed.  The new code takes ownership of the pipe like a normal read completion, but then deletes the pipe directly, which I think is clearer, and less regression prone.",
