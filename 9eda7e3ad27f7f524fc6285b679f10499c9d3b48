      "message": "Did you intend to add this line uncommented?  I agree with what you\u0027re saying in the CL description for how behavior should change, but I don\u0027t think this is the correct fix.  Let\u0027s say there are 3 NavigationItems with the following types: DESKTOP \u003d\u003e NONE \u003d\u003e MOBILE.  If you start at DESKTOP and tap the forward button twice, you would incorrectly skip reconstructing the WKWebView.  The correct fix would be to calculate |previous_item| such that it\u0027s the last NavigationItem with a non-NONE UA type.",
