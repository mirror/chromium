      "message": "No, setting this in ProcessedLocalAudioSource directly seems like a bad idea. If anything, we should plumb some information about what the consumer wants (or already provides), that may originate in ProcessedLocalAudioSource. Or perhaps just a \"This is WebRTC\" flag. There\u0027s already something akin to that in GetAutomaticGainControl(), though I\u0027m unsure how directly it maps to just WebRTC.",

Since this would only come into play once we\u0027ve already disabled it, it\u0027s unclear if the user setting this back to \"disabled\" is intended to mean \"I always want this disabled\" or \"I just want to put things back as they were before I started messing around in Settings\".",
