      "message": "A few high-level comments:\n- Why should rounded rectangle mention (or care about) sizing and children?  Any element might want rounded corners.\n- Rounded corners will probably be on most/all elements soon.  Hence RRect is probably the new base class for anything visible.  Should it be named more generically?\n- I feel like rounded corners is more of a capability that other elements may want to compose from.  Is there a way to do that without too much hackery?  Similar to how an element can employ the TransienceManager without having to derive from it.  Food for thought.",

      "message": "1. Yeah, it shouldn\u0027t. Any element should be able to resize to fit children. I\u0027ve removed this \n and also removed the padding stuff since it\u0027s related to fitting to children and shouldn\u0027t be here.\n2. Renamed to Rect per offline discussion.\n3. With this, I think rounded corners are available on elements that need them. Aggregating seems like a worse fit here since the shader for each element needs to be updated.",
