      "message": "I\u0027m still wondering if there is anyway to make Context_-\u003eGetImage() handle the unpremultipliedAlpha case, as that can really make the code much cleaner. \n\nI look at the code inside WebGLRenderingContextBase::GetImage(), and traces its function to ImageBuffer::CopyRenderingResultsFromDrawingBuffer, which uses DrawingBuffer::CopyToPlatformTexture. That function signature contains a boolean variable \"premultiplied_alpha\", and the caller hard-codes it to be \"true\". I believe that we can change this part to make the copying handles unpremultiplied data. \n\nCould you look into that? If there\u0027s a way to do this, that would really remove a lot of old code and simplifies things a lot.",
