      "message": "This sentence makes it seems like post_cleanup_callback would normally be called for memory caches during cleanup, just not if creation fails. But my understanding is that the memory cache completely ignores the callback and never runs it. This isn\u0027t intuitive to me.\n\nI think we actually want the same behavior regardless of backend type. Let\u0027s run the post_cleanup_callback for memory caches.",

      "message": "Hmm, so this is probably a good idea (since clients that don\u0027t need it for memory stuff can just not pass the callback), but I am now thinking based on the cronet failures that we may not want to do it for DISK and MEDIA caches, too, which go under same enum (but probably shouldn\u0027t), so resolving that may affect the answer here / may want a unified stategy.",
