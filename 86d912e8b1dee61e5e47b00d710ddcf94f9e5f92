      "message": "I agree that the name is bad. I guess it was suggested because it is consistent with the API (we have a Profile::GetIOTaskRunner(), see line 815 below.\n\nMaybe could be changed to file_io_task_runner_ since it is used for file IO as opposed to network IO. The function name should probably be updated in that case.",
