      "message": "Drive-by nit after the fact: I would prefer that we avoid introducing structures like this. They add a small amount of message overhead and don\u0027t really have much value IMHO. The difference (in code volume, I guess?) between one param and two params is negligible, and now instead of passing two arguments a caller has to allocate a new heap object just to wrap the same two arguments.",

      "message": "Yes as you like, but I don\u0027t understand the performance argument. I am using the URLLoaderClientEndpointsPtr in the code. It allocates a new heap object once and then it is moved a dozen of time, which should be cheap. Maybe there are some mojo internal stuff I don\u0027t know though. Let me know.\n\nMaybe you just want me not to pollute /content/common/frame.mojom. I can put it in another file if you want. (MainResourceLoaderParams?)\n\nIf you really want me to remove this struct and move the (mojom::URLLoaderPtrInfo, mojom::URLLoaderClientRequest) pair separately, I can.\nSince using it was a suggestion of several reviewers, I would like them to agree too.",
