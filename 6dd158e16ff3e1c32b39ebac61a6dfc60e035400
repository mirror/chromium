      "message": "Yea, we looked at the original tests and decided not to do the large body because SWUrlLoaderJob just passes the body handle to the client, so using a large body won\u0027t exercise any additional code paths in SWUrlLoaderJob itself. However, this will likely change with https://crbug.com/758455 \n\n(For similar reasons, I made the Blob test is a simple string, but I see URLLoaderJob is implementing URLLoaderClient for that and does some work, so probably it\u0027s useful for Blob too).",
