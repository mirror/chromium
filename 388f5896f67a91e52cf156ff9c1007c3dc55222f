      "message": "In legacy painter\u0027s definition, within an inline formatting context, paint_offset is always the offset of the block, and it needs to be passed down if the child is legacy. You shouldn\u0027t accumulate |line_box_fragment.Offset()|.\n\nFor NG, each fragment only knows offset from its parent, so we need to know accumulated paint_offset too.\n\nThe current code stores |block_paint_offset| to the member, I guess making it as an argument was easier to understand, sorry.\n\nWe need to eliminate this distinction since it\u0027s confusing. I think, when traversing inline children:\n\nA. Pass both |block_paint_offset| and |paint_offset| and use either one appropriately (current).\nB. Pass |block_paint_offset| only and come up with how to compute NG\u0027s |paint_offset| from it.\nC. Pass |paint_offset| only. When we find legacy child, compute |block_paint_offset|.\n\nIf we want to follow the same convention as other painters for this one too, probably B?",
