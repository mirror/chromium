I can think of three other options:\n\n1) Leave it as-is, because in practice this is probably fine.\n\n2) Remove the dispatcher argument from the constructor and have the caller set it as a property instead.\n\n3) Remove the dispatcher property from the base class, add it to each individual subclass instead, and set the ivar directly.",

Setting a superclass property inside an init seems like it\u0027s technically OK but should probably be avoided.\n\nA fourth possibility to fix this is to add the dispatcher parameter to the superclass init (or make a new superclass init with dispatcher as a param).
