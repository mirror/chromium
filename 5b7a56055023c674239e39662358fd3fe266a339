      "message": "I had a think about what we want to record and I couldn\u0027t really come up with a better solution than this. With this approach we get a % of the number of total users who have at one point opted out. If a user opts out and opts back in again we still consider them opted out.\n\nIf we record people who opt back in things get more complicated - we have 3 groups of users:\n- those who\u0027ve never opted out.\n- those who\u0027ve opted out.\n- those who\u0027ve opted out and opted in.\nWhat\u0027s more, once a use enters the last group, we don\u0027t know whether they are currently opted out or in - all we know is that they\u0027ve done each one at least once.\n\nThe final approach would be logging for all users at some point whether they are opted-in or opted-out. This would give us an accurate %, but would add logging to some point and the only points I can think of that make sense are on the startup path which would add latency for this.\n\nSo I think this approach is probably the best as I guess the number of people who re-opt-in will be small and not worth the bother, but I wanted your opinion.",
