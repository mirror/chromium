      "message": "I\u0027m not entirely sure about this, the guidelines in the histograms readme file says that \"rule of thumb is at most 1% of samples should be in the overflow bucket\" [1], which seems to be the case here? (I expect the percentage of users that report more than 100 tabs on resume to be way less than 1%). I think that knowing that 0.X% of users are in the 100+ tabs (i.e. overflow) bucket is good enough here and will help us get more accurate metrics?\n\n(on the other hand the guidelines say \"Err on the side of too large a range versus too short a range\", so I don\u0027t have any strong opinion here).\n\n[1] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/tools/metrics/histograms/README.md",
