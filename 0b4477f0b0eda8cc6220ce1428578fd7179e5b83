Question:\n\nAssuming that one is building on a Linux workstation, with Java setup already, does that mean that as part of building the usual \"chrome\" target, it will spawn java binary and perform type-checking, basically slowing down the build for anyone who has Java installed locally?\n\nIIUC, type-checking is not necessary for the code to build, it is just being added as an extra target. Is that accurate?\n\nCould you take a look at https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/closure_compilation.md#typechecking-your-javascript, which describes the approach currently used for type-checking all of Chromium\u0027s JS code?",
