NSImage is explicitly thread-unsafe according to\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/ThreadSafetySummary/ThreadSafetySummary.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000057i-CH12-126728\n\nbut that page is silent about NSImageReps (it does say \"Immutable objects are generally thread-safe\"). Probably its design is similar to Image/ImageSkiaRep. I think its OK. NSObject refcounts are atomic.",
