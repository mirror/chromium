      "message": "tl;dr: Yes for now, and yes in the future. There will be behavior changes in future CLs, but only tab capture needs this and I have a plan that will work for all DirectRenderer impls.\n\nFor now: This is just an API change, but retaining the current behavior. Meaning, the result will be either a texture or a SkBitmap, depending on what the DirectRenderer impl supports (texture is the preference). If --disable-gpu is present, the client will get a bitmap result (from SoftwareRenderer).\n\nIn the future: All clients except tab capture (and Ash screen rotator) actually want the texture result. All other clients asking for the texture also do their own readback to produce a SkBitmap. They have 100\u0027s of LOC to instantiate and manage a GLHelper just to get the same result that a bitmap copy output request would provide. I\u0027m going to fix that in soon-upcoming CLs.\n\nAfter fixing that, I will be changing the behavior so that clients either get a texture or nothing (no SkBitmap fallback). With --disable-gpu, things should still work out fine, however: Tab capture is moving into VIZ, and will not be requesting textures anymore. I will be introducing a new I420 ResultFormat which will provide the result in system memory. So, any DirectRenderer impl will return the I420 result regardless of whether --disable-gpu is being used.",
