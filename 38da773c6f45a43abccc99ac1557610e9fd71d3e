      "message": "Is the assumption that the CAST_MODE_LIST view will not create a blocking issue? (A blocking issue takes up the entire dialog, whereas a non-blocking one just creates a black banner at the bottom.) Otherwise, if you go into the ISSUE view from CAST_MODE_LIST, I think dismissing the issue will take you to the SINK_LIST view instead of back to the CAST_MODE_LIST view. That might be okay though.",

      "message": "As of this point, the only issues that should appear in the cast mode list are non-blocking bad file issues. If a blocking issue is added that might appear in the cast mode list, I think that the desired behavior will probably need to be determined based on what caused the issue, so kicking back to the SINK LIST for now I think is fine.",
