I think the purpose of the request in https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d801607 was specifically about knowing if sync was enabled for an account that we sign out of, which could still be true or false even if it was the Chrome account right?",

      "message": "The chrome authenticated account and the sync account are the same thing.\n\nIt may be possible that somehow the user is signed into chrome but then disabled all datatypes in sync, in which case we could consider them to be authenticated but not syncing. I think this is enough of an edge case to be neglected, but let me know if you want to make that distinction.",
