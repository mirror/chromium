      "message": "I think this sequence of events could pose a problem:\n1) |showSelectionMenu()| is called which then sets |mPendingShowActionMode| to true\n2) The word is selected so |SELECTION_HANDLES_SHOWN| is triggered. This causes us to show the floating menu and set |mPendingShowActionMode| to false.\n3) |onClassified()| is called which means we adjust the selection.\n4) |SELECTION_HANDLES_MOVED| is triggered from the adjustment. Since |mPendingShowActionMode| is false we don\u0027t call |showActionModeOrClearOnFailure()| which means the new SmartSelect menu items won\u0027t be displayed.\n\nI know that the |mPendingShowActionMode| is hacky and brittle so the following suggestion might not work. But maybe you could set |mPendingShowActionMode| to true in |onClassified()| after the |mWebContents.adjustSelectionByCharacterOffset()| call instead of in |showSelectionMenu()|.",
