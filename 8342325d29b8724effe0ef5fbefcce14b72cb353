      "message": "Stefan, I think that the UpdateGeometry call would have the potential to trigger JS in plugins which could change the FrameTree, so I like the approach to collect the parts before calling UpdateGeometry on them.\n\nYour suggested code is for LocalFrameView children only.  Do you have a suggestion on how to handle the RemoteFrameView and PluginView children?  The code that I have handles all 3.",

      "message": "There should be no way for a child LocalFrameView to run script during UpdateGeometry.  Even if the child FrameView has dirty layout and winds up calling into UpdateLayout(), that method has a ScriptForbiddenScope.  It\u0027s worth adding a DCHECK after the call to part-\u003eUpdateGeometry() to verify that the frame tree hasn\u0027t changed.\n\nThe old code skips over non-LocalFrameView children, that\u0027s why I think it\u0027s better to use ForAllChildLocalFrameViews.",

      "message": "I agree that LocalFrameView will not run script.  But plugins can.  The code does not skip remoteframe and plugin children.  The old code works:\n\n1/ LayoutEmbeddedContent objects (previously LayoutPart) register themselves with LocalFrameView::AddPart which stores into LocalFrameView::parts_.\n\nSee: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/layout/LayoutEmbeddedContent.cpp?l\u003d52\u0026rcl\u003dd2529b8590c349d96f6144c09e8df6e982b15145\n\nNote that subclass LayoutEmbeddedObject does this for plugins.\n\n2/ LocalFrameView::UpdateGeometries iterates all |parts_| and calls UpdateGeometry.\n\nSee: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/frame/LocalFrameView.cpp?l\u003d1482\u0026rcl\u003dd2529b8590c349d96f6144c09e8df6e982b15145\n\nThere is special case handling here for when the part\u0027s EmbeddedContentView is a LocalFrameView.  The special handling calls CheckDoesNotNeedLayout at the end which is a debug level enforcement.\n\nFor plugins, the PluginView::GeometryMayHaveChanged method is called from https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/layout/LayoutEmbeddedContent.cpp?l\u003d368\u0026rcl\u003dd2529b8590c349d96f6144c09e8df6e982b15145\n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nI think the current code that I have is the simplest way to remove the LocalFrameView::parts_ field and use FrameTree instead.  If you like the current approach, I can go ahead and submit this CL.\n\nI\u0027m also considering doing a major change of the code here and in LayoutEmbeddedContent::UpdateGeometry and try to cleanly separate the handling of LocalFrameView, RemoteFrameView and PluginView.  I might try that in a new CL, and then you guys can pick what you like best.",
