      "message": "Was your comment about \"that could also be done here, but the dialog would be a little narrow\" intended to refer to if we just removed this override entirely so this applied pre-MD too?\n\nIf so, what makes it \"too narrow\" pre-MD but OK in MD?  The fact that there\u0027s no dialog width snapping pre-MD?  Does that mean that the preferred sizes of some of the child elements should actually be larger?",

      "message": "Because there is no width snapping, it could calculate to less than 320. That might make make the view look too crowded. I suspect that was the reason for the hard-coded 370. In MD mode, the smallest width is 320.\n\nThe alternative is to leave the hard-coded 370 so that pre-MD the width is unchanged, but in MD mode it would \"snap\" to 512.",
