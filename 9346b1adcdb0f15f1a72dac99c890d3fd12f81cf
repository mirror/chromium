      "message": "Was your comment about \"that could also be done here, but the dialog would be a little narrow\" intended to refer to if we just removed this override entirely so this applied pre-MD too?\n\nIf so, what makes it \"too narrow\" pre-MD but OK in MD?  The fact that there\u0027s no dialog width snapping pre-MD?  Does that mean that the preferred sizes of some of the child elements should actually be larger?",

      "message": "Because there is no width snapping, it could calculate to less than 320. That might make make the view look too crowded. I suspect that was the reason for the hard-coded 370. In MD mode, the smallest width is 320.\n\nThe alternative is to leave the hard-coded 370 so that pre-MD the width is unchanged, but in MD mode it would \"snap\" to 512.",

      "message": "Do you have a screenshot of it pre-Harmony with no snapping?  I\u0027d prefer to just rip out the snapping but if it would really look awful maybe we just land like this and move on, as it\u0027s not worth fixing the pre-Harmony code if the Harmony code looks good.\n\nI mostly want to check because it might highlight other problems that we\u0027d see in Harmony if we changed the snap widths in the future.",
