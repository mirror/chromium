      "message": "Seems like a pattern similar to what the HISTOGRAM_MACROS elide, might be worth considering one that does similar here if we have to use statics.\n\nInstead of allocating this as a static can we hold it within this object? WMPI instances are 1:1 with \u003cvideo\u003e or \u003caudio\u003e elements, so as more are created we\u0027ll overwrite this value. Meaning any eventual crash may be tagged with the wrong key.",
