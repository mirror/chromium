      "message": "How useful is the historical adjustment data? My impression is that it is usually a very short interval. If it is occasionally a larger adjustment then does folding that larger adjustment into the average help, compared to just using zero here? I just want to be sure that all complexity is justified.",

      "message": "I wonder why the recommend formula uses interval / 8? When dividing (including modulo) by \u0027n\u0027 it is common to add n / 2 first to turn truncation into round-to-nearest. Adding interval / 8 seems to implement a very weird rounding rule where 0.875 to 1.875 (7/8 to 1+7/8) are rounded to 1.0. At least I think that is what it does.\n\nBut, no matter.",
