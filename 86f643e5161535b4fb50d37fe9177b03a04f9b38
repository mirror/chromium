It might work.\nWhich exact thread are you referring to that we already have for the underlying video capture?\n\nIn the pre-service legacy code path of video capture, on Android and Linux, we were using a thread from the audio manager to run the equivalent code. I thought about using that one here, too, but I did not see an easy way to plumb access to a corresponding TaskRunner from the code that knows the audio manager to this location here.",
