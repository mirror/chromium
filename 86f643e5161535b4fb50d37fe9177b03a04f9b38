It might work.\nWhich exact thread are you referring to that we already have for the underlying video capture?\n\nIn the pre-service legacy code path of video capture, on Android and Linux, we were using a thread from the audio manager to run the equivalent code. I thought about using that one here, too, but I did not see an easy way to plumb access to a corresponding TaskRunner from the code that knows the audio manager to this location here.",

My thinking is that the service code is fairly lightweight, so maybe it can just run on the thread that the service is created on (https://cs.corp.google.com/eureka_internal/chromium/src/services/service_manager/embedder/embedded_instance_manager.cc?l\u003d28), to avoid threading issues.\n\nI don\u0027t know enough to know if that would work or not :)",
