I\u0027m pretty sure that if we specify a task runner when adding an interface to the BinderRegistry, that task runner gets used for dispatching all subsequent tasks for that bound interface, no?",

      "message": "Hey Renjie,\n\nAs Daniel noted, we\u0027re now *on* |io_task_runner_| in this method, so you can change the rest of the body as well (it\u0027s currently assuming that it\u0027s on the UI thread). One question about correctness though: Does that break the two-step initialization starting at line 244 below (i.e., did the first step actually need to be on the UI thread)? Alternatively, does it obviate the need for two-step initialization since we now know we\u0027re on the IO thread when we start the initialization? It seems like one or the other should be true, i.e., either the two-step initialization was needed and being on the IO thread here is actually problematic, or we can eliminate the two-step initialization entirely now that we\u0027re on the IO thread here. :)",
