I\u0027m no authority on our security model, or same-site cookies, I\u0027m just wondering if it would make more sense to modify the request itself (Make it look like a top level request by setting a null initiator?), rather than add another way to set this information.",

      "message": "We currently trust the renderer with this information already, so we aren\u0027t worse off. Unless we go through the browser process to verify that the frame sending the request could have injected a content script, I don\u0027t see how we could avoid trusting the renderer.\nAlso, wouldn\u0027t modifying the request also happen in the renderer? If it does, it is no different. If it doesn\u0027t, then we could have put that logic there, but it likely would be a layering violation, no?",
