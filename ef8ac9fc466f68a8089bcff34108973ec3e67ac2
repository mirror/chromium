      "message": "Ah, hm, I see. So the issue is that we use the cached fragment on LayoutNGBlockFlow but it does not have the right offset? Maybe there\u0027s a way we could fix up the offset when we access the fragment?\n\nI\u0027m fine with this approach for now though. But can you add a comment (here or in the commit message) that the reason the offset is wrong is because we just access the cached_fragment_ in the LayoutNGBlockFlow which is untouched after layout? (Or if I misunderstood the reason, please describe the actual reason :) )",
