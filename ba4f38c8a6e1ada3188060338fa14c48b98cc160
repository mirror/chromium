      "message": "It seems like this is manually creating a dialog bottom button row.  I would assume the reason for that is to avoid having esc trigger the \"cancel\" button.  But we can simply make \"close\" not call \"cancel\" and get that same effect.  I think what you want is probably something like https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/557139/ .",
