      "message": "I understand the motivation behind this check, but it\u0027s surprising to me it\u0027s in third_party/WebKit/PRESUBMIT. Shouldn\u0027t we have globally consistent behavior here?\n\nIn Chromium, most files happen to include build/build_config.h transitively, so the check would fire a lot there I suppose. But maybe that\u0027s worth doing anyhow â€“ and if not, maybe it\u0027s not worth doing for blink either.\n\nFinally, build_config is in build/, not base/ -- do we really need a wtf wrapper header for this? Can\u0027t blink include build/build_config.h directly?",
