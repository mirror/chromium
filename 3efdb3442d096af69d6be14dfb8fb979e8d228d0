Window manager (here ash) may want to arbitrarily create copies of layers for animations in any moment. We could add a callback to ask the client to call aura::Window::AllocateLocalSurfaceId, but on the other hand I\u0027m not very sure if it\u0027s necessary for the client to know that we\u0027re doing a layer copy and involve it in the process. It\u0027s an implementation detail of the window manager, and wm can take care of reallocating the surface on it\u0027s own.\n\nAnyways, the new version of https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/647347 simplifies this logic slightly by asking the layer owner (here aura::window) to allocate a new surface id.
