      "message": "Could missing things here that I noticed were:\n- SQS with multiple quads/quads not the same size as the SQS.\n- RenderPassDrawQuads - does the quad itself occlude or do the quads in the RenderPass it points to occlude? The bounds of the RPDQ may not be filled by the RenderPass it points to, it could be for example 2 quads in the top-left and bottom-right of the RenderPass bounds, with empty other 2 corners.\n- Other quad types to be sure they behave.",
