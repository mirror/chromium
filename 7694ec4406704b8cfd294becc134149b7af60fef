The current version could show that a run with lots of missed vsyncs is better than a run with a single missed vsync if the average of multiple misses is less than the single miss.\n\nAlso, do we want to create additional charts for min/max FPS?\n\nAny other feedback what statistics would be useful to report welcome.",
