It seems wasteful to pass in both a BrowserContext and a BrowsingInstance, but maybe that\u0027s better for cases like this?

Returning false from ShouldUseProcessPerSite sounds better for the BI-scoped case.\n\nI tried this, but it\u0027s a bit involved, so I\u0027m curious if it\u0027s OK to punt this until a followup CL to deal with --process-per-site with BI-scoped isolated origins?  The problem is ShouldUseProcessPerSite is defined publicly on RPH and used from SiteDetails, and I don\u0027t think we want to expose BI from the content public API.  We could try to pass a SiteInstance instead, but that\u0027d be blocked on the same problem in the DetermineSiteInstanceForURL call site, similarly to GetProcessHostForSite (see my other comments on that). \n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e  That still would need a way for us to plumb through the BrowserContext to IsSuitableHost -\u003e ShouldLockToOrigin -\u003e DoesSiteRequireDedicatedProcess.

Why would we need to pass both?  Are there cases we have the BrowserContext but not the BrowsingInstance?\n\nSorry, this was definitely confusing. :)  I think I wanted to say that if we didn\u0027t want to pass a BrowsingInstance into here, we\u0027d need to find a way to still pass the BrowsingContext into IsSuitableHost -\u003e ShouldLockToOrigin -\u003e DoesSiteRequireDedicatedProcess, which is called from here.  That means those functions would need to be able to take both a BrowsingInstance, which would be used when available, and a BrowsingContext to fall back to if BrowsingInstance is null.  I think this doesn\u0027t make much sense, and the best way forward is to find a way to pass SiteInstance into all process-per-site functions.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e  In any case, I\u0027ll need to add a test for --process-per-site behavior in a subsequent CL that introduces isolated origins within a BI, and perhaps iron out more of this behavior there.\n\u003e \n\u003e Sounds good.",
