      "message": "Hmm .. the problem is that we must compare these constraints with sizes scaled by the page zoom factor (i.e., those sizes are CSS pixels * page zoom factor). The page zoom factor contains DSF by enabling --use-zoom-for-dsf. If we do not scale these constraints here, we must scale all code that compare these constraints and those sizes (and we must also consider variables has dependencies with these constraints).\n\nAfter enabling --use-zoom-for-dsf, some values previously in CSS pixel scale becomes in CSS pixel * DSF scale (e.g., DOM elements). How about writing some comments in ViewportDescription?",
