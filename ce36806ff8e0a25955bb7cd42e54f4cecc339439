SharedWorker and Worker don\u0027t have their own ServiceWorkerProviderContext which keeps |controller| which the browser process sends SetController IPCs to? Seems like that would be a more sane/straightforward design than having the Document\u0027s ProviderContext propagate the controller to a separate interface for Worker clients.",
