Odds are the download logic will be removed from this class even before the directory goes away, as downloading is going to be integrated with PlzNavigate logic.",

For the test file, the embbeded_test_server() supports mock-http-headers files to add the relevant header.\n\nThere are already download browser tests, which have all the infrastructure to test if something is downloaded instead of navigated to, and have a few mime type tests already, I believe, so maybe add the test there (content/browser/download/download_browsertest.cc?)",
