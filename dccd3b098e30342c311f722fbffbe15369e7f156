      "message": "yes - importing this file is intentional, after https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/535063/.\n\nSome subdirs in wpt include Python scripts, which we didn\u0027t import before - I believe that this was because our general policy was to import only tests.\n\nBut as a general direction now, I beleive we want to import as much as possible and change as little as possible -- this allows Chromium developers to use and modify these scripts (and have those changes exported).\n\n\nOne possible issue that may come up, is: in Chromium there\u0027s a presubmit check for scripts with shebang lines that aren\u0027t executable. I\u0027m not entirely sure whether this will pass that check, but if it passes then I think it should be committed as-is.",
