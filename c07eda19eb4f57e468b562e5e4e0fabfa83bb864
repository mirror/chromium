There\u0027s another section for tests with \"if (!is_mac || mac_views_browser)\" on line 2118 below - can we move this there?\n\nAlso, do you know if Mac has another view that might have this problem?  chrome/browser/ui/cocoa/hung_renderer_controller.mm, maybe?  (Probably ok to fix that separately, if needed.)",
