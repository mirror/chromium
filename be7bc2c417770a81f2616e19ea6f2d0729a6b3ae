How does something like this feel:\n\n// Requests a callback with the next Geoposition obtained later than |time_of_prev_position|.\n// Specifically:\n// * If a position has been obtained subsequent to |time_of_prev_position|, returns it.\n// * Otherwise, returns an updated position once a network change has occurred.\n// * Note that it is possible for |callback| to never be called if no network change ever occurs // * after |time_of_prev_position|.\nvoid QueryNextPosition(\n  base::Time time_of_prev_position, ...);\n\nI realize that that skirts the detail of \"new position is available but network change has been detected\", but I think that\u0027s basically an impl detail?",
