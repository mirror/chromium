      "message": "I agree that it was weird to cache something from a passed-in value; I\u0027ve changed the function to just use CommandLine::ForCurrentProcess().\n\nRegarding just having a ShouldIgnoreChannel() global function... this would work in production, but it makes testing much more difficult (since some statics can be shared between tests).  On the other hand, it would reduce the number of commandline checks from 1-per-feature to 1-per-process, which is a pretty good reduction.  Any ideas how we would be able to isolate it for testing?",
