However, it\u0027s set on the UI thread, but read by the URLDataManagerBackend on the IO thread - it\u0027s OK the first time it\u0027s set, since there is a task posted in the URLDataSource constructor, which we know will execute before any later posted task to the IO thread, but the rest of the time it is a racey operation.",
