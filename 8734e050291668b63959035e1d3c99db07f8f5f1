I sense it\u0027s related to some difference in the paint rect due to the fact that the border is on the table but we\u0027re painting from the section, but the debug output doesn\u0027t support that - so I must have the wrong idea.\n\nMore examples here: https://storage.googleapis.com/chromium-layout-test-archives/linux_trusty_blink_dbg/220/layout-test-results/paint/invalidation/table-collapsed-border-crash-log.txt",
