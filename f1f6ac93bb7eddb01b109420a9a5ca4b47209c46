      "message": "I\u0027d probably call this `symbolizer`, not `llvm`. llvm sounds more like a module or package name than an object name, and indeed you call it `llvm_symbolizer` on the other side of the API.\n\nWhere possible, I tend to prefer matching variable names to argument names, it\u0027s less cognitive overhead.\n\nThough, I wouldn\u0027t actually use `llvm_symbolizer` as the arg name, either, since that conflicts with the module name, and I try to avoid that where I can.",
