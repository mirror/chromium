      "message": "This is the crux of the naive application of approach #2 described by enne in http://crbug.com/771401#c1. Is this actually doing what\u0027s described there? I think so, tracing GraphicsContext::BeginRecording to PaintRecorder::beginRecording to which fiddles a canvas which is a RecordPaintCanvas as cited in aforementioned comment.\n\nNot yet done from that same comment, the portion re: \u0027...don\u0027t expect anything useful back from clip-related functions.  We could make these assert if recording_bounds_ is empty to make this a more explicit \"don\u0027t do this\".\u0027\n\nI thought to pursue that as a separate patch if this one goes forth, but could add to this one if preferred (and to validate that we aren\u0027t getting lucky test-wise while using bad data elsewhere in cc).",
