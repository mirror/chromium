      "message": "I\u0027ve decided to remove this DCHECK after all.  In my mind, an assert / DCHECK statement is supposed to describe things that should *never* happen.  The DCHECK here doesn\u0027t meet this criteria - it describes things that kind of should not happen, but *may* still happen at runtime if 1) there is a race [2 renderers coming up at the same time with the same unique name for different frames] or 2) there is a malicious renderer (simulated by the failing ecurityExploitBrowserTest.PageStateToWrongEntry test which bumps into this DCHECK because after the CL the DCHECK is checked in a few more cases - this is also seen in https://crrev.com/c/775493 which starts checking the DCHECK for a lot more cases).\n\nIf we want to reintroduce the DCHECK, we should 1) do it deep [e.g. in NEI::GetTreeNode, not just in NEI::RemoveEntryForFrame] and 2) in a way that doesn\u0027t trip the DCHECK when there is a race and/or when running the security exploit tests.",
