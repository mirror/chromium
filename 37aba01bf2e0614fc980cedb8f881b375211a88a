      "message": "Is that a statement of policy going forward or of how things currently work?\n\nThe way I think this feature should work is that the server should give it\u0027s best guess as to what the field is, and put it in server_type_, with all of the possibilities in server_predictions_. The client should then be able to offer multiple suggestion types, ranked by the confidence values.\n\nI\u0027m curious to know how often we currently get conflicts server side, is there a dashboard for this somewhere?",
