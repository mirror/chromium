This will blend the old alpha in, then clobber the resulting 0xff alpha with 0x41, and get something even lighter.\n\nIf you keep GetResultingPaintColor I think you\u0027ll need to switch out 0x41 -\u003e 0x80 (guessing) to match the spec (i.e. to get #000000 at 0.1alpha).",

I\u0027m now trying to figure out where I came up with the 0x41 value... cccccc @ .25 is f6f6f6. .5 (or 0x80) should be the right value here.\n\nThe issue here is that the stroke_color is based off the actual text color being rendered, however the comments (and the code) imply being based off the *enabled* text color. Next patch reflects this. The SetTextColor(STATE_DISABLED, ...) \"fix\" changed the behavior of the subsequent code.",
