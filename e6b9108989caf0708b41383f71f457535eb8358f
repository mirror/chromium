Which code path triggers this functionality?\n\nIIUC, there seems to be two use cases for SetWebUsageEnabled(false):\n(1) destroy the WKWebView when it\u0027s not needed to avoid playing audio and whatnot\n(2) force clearing browsing data\n\nWhat I\u0027m trying to change is (1) here. Would it make sense to create a separate API for (2) to preserve its functionality? Would this be feasible?",
