      "message": "Yeah, I considered that and had originally done it that way. I have a slight preference for not having a readable property in this case, but I don\u0027t feel strongly about it. The rationale goes like this: 1) There is no need for any user of this class to read the base view controller from this class. 2) Setting the baseVC is a pass-through method, so there is no need for an ivar to hold the baseVC in this class. I would want the getter to mirror the setter and be a pass-through method. In order to do that, we would need to cascade the getter implementation to objects further down the line. And that object has no need for a getter either. And lastly, 3) It is extra boilerplate code across two classes that is not necessary.",
