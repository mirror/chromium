      "message": "I don\u0027t think that TYPE_NONE is the right value to use for audio-only case. Potentially we could support audio for tab capture. In that case there won\u0027t be a way to distinguish it from system loopback audio. So I think it\u0027s better to use TYPE_SCREEN, but have a different field to indicate that it\u0027s audio-only stream. Maybe replace audio_only flag an enum?",

      "message": "Sorry I wasn\u0027t clear. I\u0027m suggesting to replace \"audio_share\" boolean field in DesktopMediaID with an enum field that will indicated what type of media is being requested. It would have have 3 allowed values: AUDIO, VIDEO and AUDIO_VIDEO (probably better to make it a bitmask with two bits for audio and video). Type enum will stay the same.\n\nCurrently \u0027type\u0027 indicates the source type, while \u0027audio_share\u0027 flag indicates type of the media that\u0027s being received from that source (video or video+audio). So |type| is not the best name for that field. It may be better if we rename it to source_type. WDYT?",
