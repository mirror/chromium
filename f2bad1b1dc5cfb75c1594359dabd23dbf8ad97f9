      "message": "I don\u0027t think that TYPE_NONE is the right value to use for audio-only case. Potentially we could support audio for tab capture. In that case there won\u0027t be a way to distinguish it from system loopback audio. So I think it\u0027s better to use TYPE_SCREEN, but have a different field to indicate that it\u0027s audio-only stream. Maybe replace audio_only flag an enum?",
