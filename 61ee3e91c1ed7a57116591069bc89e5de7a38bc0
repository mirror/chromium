      "message": "So, I would actually prefer a new entrypoint, e.g. glTexStorage2DImageCHROMIUM(target, width, height, internalformat, buffer_usage)\n\nThe reason is 2-fold:\n1- TexParameter* is meant to change properties of the textures even after the images are set. As is, it is a special case in that the value is only looked at when creating the texture (and if we\u0027re not careful it could cause issues, because we still accept TexParameter(..., TEXTURE_BUFFER_USAGE_CHROMIUM, ...) calls after the TexStorage2D\n2- in the implementation it takes a completely different path anyway, might as well do a different function.\n\nWDYT?",
