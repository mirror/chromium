At least I\u0027m assuming where hitting the DCHECK in SVGStopElement::StopColorIncludingOpacity, and then crashing? So that sounds like a bug in the Traversal\u003c...\u003e::ChildrenOf implementation.\n\n[1] Since the spec says: \"The vector ... of colors to use in a gradient is defined by the ‘stop’ elements that are child elements to a ‘linearGradient’, ... element.\" - \"child\" being fairly well-defined (\"direct descendant\".)",
