Maybe you don\u0027t need this entrypoint, and can set this implicitly when other entrypoints are invoked. E.g. what if it was something like |did_state_change_since_navigation_|. ..)",

      "message": "Removed the bool argument. This probably does need to stay explicit because in the content settings tests we don\u0027t trigger a real download, but we still need to pretend that a real download was invoked so that the UI will show up.\n\nAlso made it a single callsite in the cc file for clarity.",
