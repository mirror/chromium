      "message": "Since the native content provider isn\u0027t used for the other tests, we\u0027re already doing extra work in SetUp() for those tests to set it up.  How about creating a subclass of the test fixture specific to tests that need the native content?  It looks like the URL is constant for both tests, so we could also perform that step in SetUp() as well for those tests.",

      "message": "It\u0027s not so much about readability as it is for code reuse.  I agree with your point earlier about SetUp() being called for tests that don\u0027t need NativeContent navigation; we should avoid doing setup work for tests that don\u0027t need it.  But if we were to be 100% consistent with that, then we shouldn\u0027t be doing ANY native controller setup for those tests.  I don\u0027t really see a big downside to changing the name since they\u0027ll still be run in the same test suite and finding these tests is as easy as running \"git grep\" on the test names when they\u0027re failing.  That being said, since this is test code, I think it\u0027s okay to have some unused setup code if it improves the readability of our tree and our test failures.  Also since you\u0027re likely going to be the main person who will be maintaining this file, I\u0027ll defer to whatever decision you think is best.",
