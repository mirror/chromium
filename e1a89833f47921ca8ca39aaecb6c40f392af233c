      "message": "I meant simplifying all the way :) Unless I\u0027m missing something, now you only ever insert GpuFenceEntry that have a valid gl_fence_, so GpuFenceEntry::AddCallback will always run the callback immediately, so you don\u0027t need callbacks_/AddCallback/RunCallbacks, and you can also simplify CreateNewGpuFence to always fail if the entry already exists (and a few other places you can remove tests for gl_fence_/gpu_fence_ which is always valid if the entry exists).",

      "message": "Thanks for the explanation! I\u0027ve added the following to gpu_synchronization.md\u0027s Implementation Notes section. Can you sanity check that I got it right?\n\n------------------------------\n\nGPU control tasks are processed out of band and are only partially ordered in\nrespect to GL commands. A gpu_control task always happens before any following\nGL commands issued on the same IPC channel. It usually executes before any\npreceding unflushed GL commands, but this is not guaranteed. A\n`ShallowFlushCHROMIUM` ensures that any following gpu_control tasks will execute\nafter the flushed GL commands.\n\nIn this example, DoTask will execute after GLCommandA and before GLCommandD, but\nthere is no ordering guarantee relative to CommandB and CommandC:\n\n```c++\n  // gles2_implementation.cc\n\n  helper_-\u003eGLCommandA();\n  ShallowFlushCHROMIUM();\n  \n  helper_-\u003eGLCommandB();\n  helper_-\u003eGLCommandC();\n  gpu_control_-\u003eDoTask();\n  \n  helper_-\u003eGLCommandD();\n  \n  // Execution order is one of:\n  //   A | DoTask B C | D\n  //   A | B DoTask C | D\n  //   A | B C DoTask | D\n```\n\nThe shallow flush adds the pending GL commands to the service\u0027s task queue, and\nthis task queue is also used by incoming gpu control tasks and processed in\norder. The `ShallowFlushCHROMIUM` command returns as soon as the tasks are\nqueued and does not wait for them to be processed.\n\n------------------------------",
