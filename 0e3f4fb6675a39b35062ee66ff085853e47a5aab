      "message": "Hmmmm that\u0027s actually an interesting IWYU dilemna. Technically this is passed by value so this API should include full definition. But then it\u0027s move-only so the caller already has to have full-definition to std::move() the value. Of course the value could already be an r-value but that means it was returned by something which returned OnceClosure by value and by IWYU it\u0027s supposed to provide its fully defintion as well :).\n\nSo by IWYU rules we can prove that we don\u0027t need anything here...\n\nIf we don\u0027t want to rely on those rules then I guess we need full definition, I\u0027m not sure callback_forward.h is ever the right call?\n\nI won\u0027t bother updating and will start a chromium-dev bikeshed on the issue, how \u0027bout that :)?!",
