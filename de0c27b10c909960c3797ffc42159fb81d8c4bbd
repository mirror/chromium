      "message": "nit: This was for fixing a browser compositor hang. The scheduler wouldn\u0027t end the frame while wait_for_ready_to_draw_ was set to true. I think your change fixes the same problem by also looking at PendingDrawsShouldBeAborted in ShouldBlockDeadlineIndefinitely. There\u0027s a test for this: cc_unittests LayerTreeHostTestReadyToDrawVisibility. I\u0027d suggest trying to run it in a loop to make sure we don\u0027t regress it. It should hang in case of a regression.\n\nSee https://codereview.chromium.org/1247033007 for context.",
