      "message": "C++ currently doesn\u0027t store any lists of printers, so we would need to add that in the handler to avoid re-fetching all the printers each time. The other problem is that I do not think anything stops 2 printers of different types from having the same destination ID. In the map of destinations, we use DestinationStore.getKey_() to obtain unique identifiers for each destination, and the key contains both the id and the origin. It should be possible to send this key to C++ and then parse the id and origin from the string and convert the origin to PrinterType there, but I am not sure if that is any better than just sending the type and id directly.",
