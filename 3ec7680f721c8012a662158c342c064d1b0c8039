We should audited all the other places where we assign SetRequestorOrigin.\n\nI\u0027m also aware of a bug, where if a content script does an xhr to a site that it has permissions for, but the response redirects it to a third site that it doesn\u0027t have permissions for, the Origin header isn\u0027t chrome-extension:// but the page\u0027s origin.",
