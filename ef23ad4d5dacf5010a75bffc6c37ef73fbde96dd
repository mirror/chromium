      "message": "Um.. After discussing with Theresa, we can\u0027t just use ScaleType.FIT_XY \"yet\" because the icon is centered in a image view with a large background (in download item view, the image view size is 36dp but we only need 24dp icon; in ntp download snippet, the image view size is 124dp and icon size is 36dp). We can make image view the size of the icon and have a framelayout wrapper. We agree that this can be a future CL.\n\nWe thought we could resize the drawable but the setBounds method from Drawable surprisingly doesn\u0027t work for VectorDrawable...",
