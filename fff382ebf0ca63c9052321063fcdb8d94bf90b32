So they\u0027d both match, and they\u0027d ignore the theme.\n\nThe download shelf is indeed a surface that uses MD text buttons and is either themed or pseudo-themed (the story is kinda weird).  My suggestion was that before we ship we re-evaluate how these hardcoded colors look on the various themes and decide what we want to do, but that at least for now hardcoding puts us in a known state, more amenable to refactoring in advance of future behavior changes, which might not actually look all that bad.",
