You might be able to get a quick answer by asking on a mozilla IRC channel.\n\n\u003e I didn\u0027t have time for detailed investigation today. I\u0027ll try to create a patch tomorrow.

And, if adding the favicons looks like it\u0027s going to be quite a bit more work than the rest of the CL, it might make sense to split off to a follow-up CL.  If it\u0027s not too much extra, though, it\u0027s nice if we can land them together.  Thanks for working on this! \u003d)",
