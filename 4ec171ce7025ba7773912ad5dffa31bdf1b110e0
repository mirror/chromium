      "message": "Maybe there will be less churn if we call PermissionUtil::GetContentSettingsStorageType(permission) in here and in each of the embargo methods instead of having to pass in the storage type? That means knowledge of the type collapsing is isolated to within the auto blocker rather than leaking out to a bunch of other files too. Interested to see if raymes has thoughts on this.\n\nEssentially, that would let us get away with only changing this file and the unit test, which would make for a safer M60 merge too.",
