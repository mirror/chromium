      "message": "Because cross_site_iframe_factory.html creates iframes dynamically?  That\u0027s unfortunate.  I\u0027m surprised that doesn\u0027t affect more tests.\n\nI suppose if we wanted to, we could rewrite that to be a \"server-generated\" page by coding it in testserver.py instead (and spitting out static HTML files with iframes), but that might limit some ways people use the current HTML file for testing.\n\nOk, I guess we can live with it.",
