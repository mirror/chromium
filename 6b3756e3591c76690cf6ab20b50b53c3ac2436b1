      "message": "This essentially does the same thing as before since we have the |done_listener|. If the |runTest| has an uncaught error, the |WaitUntilSatisfied| will time out, whereas before, |ExecuteScript| would time out.\n\nIf you like, I could put |runTest| in a try block, so we could explicitly fail the test in the case of an error instead of waiting for the timeout. That should also make things clearer.",
