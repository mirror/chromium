      "message": "This is the only place where we call RegistrationInfo::Deserialize() and we discard the value of |last_validated|. We probably should just write it to the |last_validated| member of RegistrationInfo too, like we do with the |app_id| and other fields.\n\nLet\u0027s look at how we can iterate here. Maybe something like:\n\n  1) Store the base::Time::Now() value for each registration.\n     (w/ a simple unit test to verify we can serialize/deserialize the value)\n  2) Use the last validation timestamp to determine whether it\u0027s \"fresh\".\n     (w/ a unit test that advances time to verify this logic)\n  3) Use the freshness to occasionally check in with the server again.\n     (w/ a more intergration-y test to verify the request hits the server)\n\nIt feels like we\u0027re currently at a place where we have some of each of the aspects above, but none quite complete.\n\nIn addition, we need to think about putting the Finch machinery in place, so the second part could include the method allowing us to change the frequency.
