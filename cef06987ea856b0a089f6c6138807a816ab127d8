      "message": "This and related code has a fair number of platform conditionals that makes it hard to reason about. For example, why does this code call a different variant for Chrome OS? Can this code call AttemptExit() everywhere, and the implemention for chrome os does the right thing? Concretely I\u0027m suggesting application_lifetime.h defines the common interface and chromeos specific functionality lives in application_lifetime_chromeos.cc but the calling code doesn\u0027t have conditionals like this.",
