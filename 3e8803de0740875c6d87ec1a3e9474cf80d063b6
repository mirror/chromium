      "message": "We recreate LayerTreeFrameSinks when a context is lost right? Is it possible to get this ordering:\n\n1. A LTFS loses the context.\n2. The client creates a new context with the new Viz process but HostFrameSinkManager hasn\u0027t received a signal yet.\n3. The client requests a new CompositorFrameSink from the HostFrameSinkManager prior to the signal.\n4. The request gets dropped on the floor and we never get a CompositorFrameSink and never recover.\n\nThoughts?",
