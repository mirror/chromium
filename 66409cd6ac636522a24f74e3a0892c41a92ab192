      "message": "The \"presenting\" version of this VC may sometimes skip the animation entirely, and when it does run the animation, it will be run through a transition animator.\n\nMoving the call into the VC seemed like the most straightforward way to make the migration easier.  Longer-term, I don\u0027t think MainViewController will continue to determine which animations are run, but MainController is also not the right place for that code to live.",
