      "message": "I think the button should own an invisible hit target, not be one. That way, the hit target can exist slightly in front of the maximum extent of the button when it expands. This will fix the reticle sorting issues and the semantic weirdnesses of being a visible InvisibleHitTarget.",

      "message": "If these are truly canonical button colors, then perhaps we should set up the bindings in the button constructor and rename the member on ColorScheme to something more generic.\n\nAlternatively, we might make a struct for button colors and the ColorScheme could own several. This fn could then take a pointer to, for example, \u0026ColorScheme::close_button_colors.\n\nMy preference is for the latter.",
