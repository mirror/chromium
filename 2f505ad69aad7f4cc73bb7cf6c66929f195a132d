      "message": "The way this works I think is confusing, because things like deps, configs, and any other thing you would normally pass to a target won\u0027t work. You could handle those, but I would recommend this pattern which we use in several places:\n\nAt the top of the file, create \"fuzzer_add_configs\" and fuzzer_remove_configs\" variables containing what you want to change. Then in each target do\n  configs -\u003d fuzzer_remove_configs\n  configs +\u003d fuzzer_add_configs\nThis prevents most duplication while keeping things very explicit and clear.",
