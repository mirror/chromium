      "message": "In additional to the WPT coverage (which is great - it caught the XSDB bug), I think we also need XSDB browsertest coverage for the following scenarios:\n\n- XSDB should allow non-opaque service worker responses (this is somewhat redundant with the WPT test)\n\n- XSDB should block opaque service worker responses (this cannot be tested via layout tests, because blocking-in-the-browser is indistinguishable in layout tests from blocking-in-the-renderer)\n\n- XSDB should allow cross-origin network requests initiated by a service worker (this is something that could be possibly tested by WPT / layout test)\n\n- XSDB should block cross-origin network requests initiated by a service worker (as above, it seems impossible to test via WPT because of the blocking-in-the-browser VS blocking-in-the-renderer indistinguishability).\n\nI plan to work on the tests later this week.",
