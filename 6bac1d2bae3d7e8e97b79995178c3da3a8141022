      "message": "We now pass kNoCompileOptions even when we want to produce a code cache. ProduceCacheOptions controls if we request a code cache or not. Though, we still need to look at CompileOptions to figure out whether we are requesting a full code cache or not. If we pass kEagerCompile it generates a full code cache otherwise it is the default code cache. This is slightly confusing. We are planning to remove the Produce/consume Parser cache options, so I can clean this up then. We can add ProduceCacheOptions::kProduceFullCodeCache and use ProduceCacheOptions instead of ScriptCompiler::CompileOptions. Once the Parser cache is disabled, we don\u0027t need this function for ConsumeCache trace event.",
