      "message": "That is a valid worry, since that\u0027s exactly what happened to require this fix. It would be better to have each of the UI implementations choose whether to show an icon or text.\n\nBut moving this decision to each of 4 different platforms is a bigger job. I don\u0027t have time for that and I don\u0027t think it would make sense to not fix this now and hope to find time to do it better later.",
