There used to be a break here which you deleted in https://codereview.chromium.org/2826123004/diff/80001/components/tracing/common/process_metrics_memory_dump_provider.cc?context\u003d10\u0026column_width\u003d80\u0026tab_spaces\u003d8\n\nWas that intentional? Should this be a FALLTHROUGH instead? If so, why? If not, what are the repercussions of not having the break -- does this fix a real bug, or is the effect not observable for some reason?",
