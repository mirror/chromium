      "message": "I wouldn\u0027t say these are non-fatal. You may say both Gerrit \u0026 Git errors are \"non-fatal\" in the sense that individual errors wouldn\u0027t prevent other CLs/commits to be exported. However, Git errors are a bit more \"fatal\" than that: if a merge conflict persists, manual gardening will be needed, otherwise the commit may risk being overwritten once it slips out of the history window. Hence, I\u0027d suggest the following message:\n\n\"Attention: The following errors have prevented some commits from being exported.\"\n\nLastly, I think it\u0027d be clearer if we move the messages to the end, i.e. move `process_chromium_commits` before this `if git_errors` block.",
