Consider the case:\n* There is a single stream for a frame.\n* The stream is audible (and so the frame is also audible).\n* The stream is being removed.\n\nIn this case, the frame will not get a notification, since the frame will not be added to the |audible_frame_map| in UpdateStreams(), so the frame will be audible without having any streams.",
