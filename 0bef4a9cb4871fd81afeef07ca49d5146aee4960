      "message": "Note: I did not find a way to de-activate a group.\nIt works here, because the FieldTrialList is deleted with the ScopedFeatureList, and all groups are de-activated.\n\nHowever, if there is a FieldTrialList pre-existing to the ScopedFeatureList, then ScopedFeatureList will activate a group in it, and never de-activate it.\nI don\u0027t know if this can be fixed. I think this is fine however, because this is test code, and tests in general don\u0027t care about leaking groups.",
