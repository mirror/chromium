      "message": "My doc proposed two options: a delegate or a completion block.  I went with the delegate because I\u0027m hoping that we can somehow move enough UI code into MainViewController to make MVC the TabSwitcherDelegate, at which point the animation-specific delegate can just disappear.\n\nI think it\u0027s 50/50 whether we\u0027ll be able to pull this off or not.",
