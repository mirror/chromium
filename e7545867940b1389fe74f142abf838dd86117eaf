      "message": "If we ever get into a situation where we\u0027re dropping 1/11 frames, we\u0027re producing frames *way* too quickly. Can you explain here how that would happen? I assume it\u0027s because we\u0027re no longer waiting for frames to be complete before we submit them, so gvr internally spends a lot of time waiting for our gpu work to finish while we start doing other work?\n\nAlso, it sounds like what we really need here is for gvr to add a callback to SubmitFrame that lets us know when the frame was actually complete? Or an API to ask what the time was for the last frame or something?",
