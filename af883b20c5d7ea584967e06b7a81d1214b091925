Tracking these bits is how this class ensures it only generates legal touch event streams (e.g., it will not leak a touch, or cancel the same touch twice - that kind of thing).",

      "message": "I think this is likely too much work to perform here. In fact, even setting |cancelled| here was on the edge of too much.\n\nThe design of this class is to collect all of the kernel state in one phase, and then examine it to generate a touch event a 2nd phase.\n\nWe shouldn\u0027t have a lot of complexity at the \"collect state\" phase, because that\u0027s an incremental process and we won\u0027t necessarily have enough information (in fact, the only information we\u0027re guaranteed to have is |input.value| for this event type \u0026 code. If we do a lot of work in here, it\u0027s difficult to see that we\u0027re not introducing a dependency on ordering - generally, the individual events that make up a report are unordered - swapping two events must not change the result.",

      "message": "This seems wrong. What if it was cancelled because of MT_TOOL_PALM? This is an example of why it\u0027s important to collect all of the kernel state, and make decisions about what events to produce only at the end in the SYN_REPORT processing.",
