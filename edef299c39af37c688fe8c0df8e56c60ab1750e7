      "message": "Reading this comment got me thinking whether we should actually silently update the branding info here. Branding Info is not really part of the equivalance class, so I would expect |Store| to succeed if the equivalence class stays the same, but the branding info is updated. Given that currently |Store| is only called from |StoreAndRemoveConflicting| this is not critical to update user\u0027s databases to include Branding Info, but maybe it is something we should address anyway. What is your opinion on this?",
