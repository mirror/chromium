      "message": "iOS can\u0027t build the stuff in //services/service_manager/embedder as-is. We went to pains on the earlier CL to avoid introducing ifdefs into those files. That\u0027s why I went with the separate target here, and once I had the separate target a separate dir seemed more clear than a separation of files in the same dir into two separate targets.",

      "message": "Yes, for sure. However, there\u0027s actually another issue that I had forgotten and that had pushed me in this direction: Child processes use these files. It wasn\u0027t clear to me offhand whether the code in //services/service_manager/embedder is intended for processes other than the browser process? If that code is \"common\", I\u0027m happy to do the flattening.",
