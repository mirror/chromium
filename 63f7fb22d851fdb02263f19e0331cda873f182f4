Or checking to see that the session is active?\n\nIn the code before your CL https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/646373 the MultiUserNotificationBlocker was only created when there was a MultiUserManagerChromeOS, which was only created after login and only when the device had multiple accounts.\n\n(I had a lot of trouble with this CL with ash unittests failing because this class is always created in any AshTestBase test, and it often was blocking notifications.)",
