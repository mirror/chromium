It\u0027s far too easy to confuse this with what \"capture\" means in other, related contexts; such as a WebContents\u0027s keyboard/input focus. That said, I\u0027m not sure what would be better (maybe always say, \"screen capture\"?). I had planned on revisiting the naming with http://crbug.com/540965.",
