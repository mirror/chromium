It looks correct.\nIf the caller of this method is only StopWorker, I think we should specialize this for StopWorker because the other methods in the internals ui have each methods.\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/service_worker/service_worker_internals_ui.cc?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d374\n\nMy suggestion is:\n1: Changing the name of CallServiceWorkerVersionMethod to StopWorker\n2: Inlining CallServiceWorkerVersionMethodWithVersionID to (new) StopWorker\n3: Calling version-\u003eStopWorker() instead of (*version.get().*method).",
