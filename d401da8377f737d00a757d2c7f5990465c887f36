      "message": "Before moving to the initial CL for this, a general comment about your approach here.\n\nIt would be best to not have the logic inside of while here. That is essentially a variant of Tab#attachAndFinalizeReparenting if you look at the things you are doing and it does miss a few important things to attach to. (native side for example). I think we should change attachAndFinalizeReparenting and make it work in your case as well and keep all attach logic in one shared place to avoid diverging codepaths in the future.",
