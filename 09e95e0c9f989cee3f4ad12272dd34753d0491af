      "message": "That\u0027s a fair point, but looks like the code above still relies on this magical dtor behavior (see `return FAILED_*;` statements above).\n\nWe should make this consistent either way, but I actually have a slight preference towards leaving it as it is. The file comment for ScopedTempDir very clearly states this behavior, and it\u0027s also unclear to me why else it would be called \"scoped\". :-)\n\nUnless, of course, you intend to change this behavior.",

      "message": "I guess I was not explaining this the best way. Let me try again.\n\nWith a normal scoper like a unique_ptr, when one calls release(), which is the equivalent to ScopedTempFile::Take(), normally one receives the return result from release(), and do whatever with the raw pointer.\n\nIn the existing code, the Take() call is a bit magical, as the caller does not save the returned FilePath. So it is a bit tricker to figure out what happened to the directory. This CL is the unique_ptr equivalent of taking:\n\nstd::unique_ptr\u003cFoo\u003e foo \u003d std::make_unique\u003cFoo\u003e();\n...\nif (!MaybeTakeOwnershipOfRawPointer(foo.get())\n  return;  // |foo| deletes its pointer.\nfoo.release();  // |foo| calls release(), nobody takes the result, what happened?\n\nand transforming it to:\n\nstd::unique_ptr\u003cFoo\u003e foo \u003d std::make_unique\u003cFoo\u003e();\n...\nFoo* foo_ptr \u003d foo.release();\nif (!MaybeTakeOwnershipOfRawPointer(foo_ptr) {\n  delete foo_ptr;\n  return;\n}",
