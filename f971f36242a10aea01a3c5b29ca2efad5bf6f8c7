      "message": "Wondering if instead of multiple similarly-named functions with similar bodies, we can just have one GetSearchEngineReferralId() function which takes an arg indicating which engine (ideally the engine\u0027s prepopulate ID, but maybe a separate enum).\n\nThis question applies up the stack into the Java world too.",

      "message": "I wondered about this way of naming this param before, and I\u0027m still wondering.\n\nI kinda think we should name this {google:referralID}, since we\u0027re the entity who\u0027s created this concept.  The actual value is computed using the prepopulate ID of the engine.  This would prevent someone from making a random non-preopulated search engine and sending other engine\u0027s referral IDs to it, which seems like a desirable thing; but that\u0027s really a side effect.  I mainly just think it\u0027s semantically saner to do it this way.\n\nNote: If the ID is empty, the URL just ends with \"\u0026\", which is undesirable.  If you instead did something like {referralid}q\u003d{searchTerms}, I think you get what you want?  Same for Yandex.",
