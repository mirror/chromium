      "message": "Okay, so if there is no audio output device, we can\u0027t have desktop audio capture. This makes sense. :)\n\nHowever, what I was asking about in the last code review: For loopback devices, shouldn\u0027t their audio parameters match the default audio output parameters? Rationale: The output audio is being looped-back as an audio input. If the format doesn\u0027t match, then Chrome has to resample the audio somewhere (possibly more than once, if it has to resample-back again).\n\nThis is why I was suggesting, for loopback devices only, there should be:\n\n  return audio_manager-\u003eGetOutputStreamParameters(default device id);\n\nOr, maybe we should make sure all platform AudioManager impls return the right parameters when GetInputStreamParameters(loopback device id) is called? Currently, it seems that this triggers fallback logic (e.g., audio_manager_win.cc:287); and the hard-coded 48kHz there might not match the speaker device\u0027s sampling rate.\n\nOr, am I misunderstanding something?",
