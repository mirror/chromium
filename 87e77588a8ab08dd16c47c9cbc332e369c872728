      "message": "Another way to potentially think about this would be to treat \"tags\" as another filter property, but use a different matching algorithm than string equality. Having flexibility in matching for different filter properties might be useful in general: for example, you could imagine filtering by locale with a prefix, i.e. en_*, or filtering by version with a comparison, i.e. all versions after 63.0.1234.0.",

The issue with doing something like this is that, from the email discussion thread https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/d/topic/clank-frontend/URtDW0QU4ac/discussion Max (who is, after all, one of the primary customers for this) seems to dislike ideas for multiple selections, or similar, in the viewer.",
