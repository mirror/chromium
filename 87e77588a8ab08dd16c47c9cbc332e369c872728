      "message": "Another way to potentially think about this would be to treat \"tags\" as another filter property, but use a different matching algorithm than string equality. Having flexibility in matching for different filter properties might be useful in general: for example, you could imagine filtering by locale with a prefix, i.e. en_*, or filtering by version with a comparison, i.e. all versions after 63.0.1234.0.",

The issue with doing something like this is that, from the email discussion thread https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/d/topic/clank-frontend/URtDW0QU4ac/discussion Max (who is, after all, one of the primary customers for this) seems to dislike ideas for multiple selections, or similar, in the viewer.",

      "message": "I have decided to stick with three categories of data, both in the JSON file and (more importantly) in the database, since it seems to work:\n- Key/Value filters defined and set by ScreenShooter, and usable for filtering in the UI\n- Tags. Simple string values used for filtering in the UI.\n- Other metadata; key/value pairs added by ScreenShooter that are not suitable for filtering but that may be of interest (e.g. the exact time at which the test was run).\n\nWhile we could spend more time looking at other options this feels good enough, and I want to launch the actual UI catalogue asap. Note, however, that once the stable version of the catalogue is launched then this will be difficult to change (transforming live databases is difficult).",
