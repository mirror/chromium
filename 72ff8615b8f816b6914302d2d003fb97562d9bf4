      "message": "Not a huge fan of introducing a bidirectional dependency here. \n\nMaybe instead of it, we add a method to Item (something like PerformPostSelectionAction), that ends up calling GoBack in most (all?) the items we have now. Then, we change the list to call SetSelected(); PerformPostSelectionAction(); here https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/ui/views/payments/payment_request_item_list.cc?rcl\u003db17fc441b2d272d7b1582e6d39a474c5003130d7\u0026l\u003d208 if the item is not already selected, PerformPostSelectionAction only if it is. We can then remove the GoBack() calls in the derived item classes\u0027 SetSelected().\n\nSince the derived item classes already know about the dialog (they can GoBack() already), we won\u0027t have to pass the parent sheet around this way.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "So I tried it like this, but it runs into trouble in the Shipping Address screen. In that context, we want to defer calling GoBack until after the spec has been updated (since we don\u0027t go back if the merchant rejects the shipping address), and SelectItem happens before kicking off the spec update.\n\nI\u0027m open to other ideas...perhaps it would be less uncomfortable adding this dependency if we added a GoBack method to the ItemList, rather than giving full access to the parent sheet?",
