      "message": "Would this likely also be the interface that the out-of-browser code is using?  For example today renderers talk to the cookie store via RenderFrameMessageFilter::{Get,Set}Cookie, which is an interface that is layered on top of cookies store but with additional access check with ChildProcessSecurityPolicy. I imagine a frame will be eventually just given a pipe to this interface which indicates the frame has access to the cookies.  (While, one foreseeable issue I can imagine is that currently it uses sync IPC to get cookies)",
