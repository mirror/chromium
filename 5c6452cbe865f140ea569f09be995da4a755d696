      "message": "So this was itching at me too, and I spent a bit of time trying to come up with a good unification of these two types.  I couldn\u0027t come up with something that I thought was as clear as the current set.  I didn\u0027t consider a bitfield, but thinking about it I\u0027m disinclined in that direction (because including strict but not lax in a filter doesn\u0027t really make sense given the nature of the semantics).  So: Agreed, but haven\u0027t thought of an improvement to date.\n\nI don\u0027t object to changing the existing code if we do come up with something, though.  I\u0027m going to assume that if we keep working on this, it\u0027ll be in a separate CL; let me know if you disagree with that choice.",

      "message": "Would this likely also be the interface that the out-of-browser code is using?  For example today renderers talk to the cookie store via RenderFrameMessageFilter::{Get,Set}Cookie, which is an interface that is layered on top of cookies store but with additional access check with ChildProcessSecurityPolicy. I imagine a frame will be eventually just given a pipe to this interface which indicates the frame has access to the cookies.  (While, one foreseeable issue I can imagine is that currently it uses sync IPC to get cookies)",
