An extension with a non-empty _metadata folder was uploaded but rejected for publishing Though I am not sure if it was due to presence of _metadata folder, the email said - \n\n\"Your item did not comply with the following section of our policy:\n\nIf your app has a blank description field and appears to be suspicious, we may remove it.\"\n\nAlso, we would eventually want the CWS to delete any _metadata folder on upload, see https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d760850",
