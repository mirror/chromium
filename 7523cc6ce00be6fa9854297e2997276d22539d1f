      "message": "DidUpdateFaviconURL() is not solely called when the page has finished loading. For instance, DidUpdateFaviconURL() will be called with a default (/favicon.ico) favicon if the user presses \"Stop\" while the page is loading.\n\nhttps://webapk-test.appspot.com/static/a.html is a test page for this case. It has a lot of data before the \u003clink rel\u003d\"icon\"\u003e tag. Thus, when the navigation commits, the \u003clink rel\u003d\"icon\"\u003e tag may not have been read yet. The navigation commits when the first bit (not all!) of the page has been read.\n\nA long time ago, it was suggested to me to use WebContentsObserver::DocumentOnLoadCompletedInMainFrame() to determine whether the page has finished loading. I am unsure how WebContentsObserver::DocumentOnLoadCompletedInMainFrame() relates to when WebContentsObserver::DidStartNavigation() and when WebContentsObserver::DidFinishNavigation() are called",

      "message": "I could not reproduce the issue you describe. Can you elaborate the steps?\n\nI did once achieve to observe https://webapk-test.appspot.com/favicon.ico as reported icon (i.e. default path) by manually stopping the load (with simulated slow 3G network), but I can no longer reproduce. This is a problematic scenario because it could lead to a 404 (and assuming no favicon was cached for the page URL or expired, and assuming that content reports a 404 despite an stopped navigation) and hence the removal of the favicon. Having said that, if this is the only problem we have, isn\u0027t it corner-case enough to live with it?\n\nFrom what I read in the code, in most circumstances, if \"Stop\" is used while the page is loading, DidUpdateFaviconURL() will *not* be called, because of WebLocalFrameImpl::IconURLs() returning an empty icon list (https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/frame/WebLocalFrameImpl.cpp?dr\u003dCSs\u0026l\u003d552) and hence RenderFrameImpl::SendUpdateFaviconURL() returning early (https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/renderer/render_frame_impl.cc?type\u003dcs\u0026l\u003d3910).\n\nI would be happier if we could capture this in a browser test, but it seems tricky.",
