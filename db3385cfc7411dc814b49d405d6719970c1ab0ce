But IsReusableResourceCommon() is still big to inline.\n\nI found that this part can be cleaned up like this. So for now, I did only that.\n\nResource::CanReuse() refactoring was just worth doing by itself for code reduction and having better structure by gathering existing vs. new comparison to fewer places (though it\u0027s still distributed). It wasn\u0027t so motivated with this clean up.",
