      "message": "Thanks for trying this plumbing.  Tricky thing with the throttling idea is that this would make CORS work before any URLLoader handling, while we probably don\u0027t want to hook up CORS if the given URLLoaderFactory is not for network (e.g. for interceptors).  We can split the throttles into two, e.g. before- and after- interceptors, but that might be a bit cumbersome.",
