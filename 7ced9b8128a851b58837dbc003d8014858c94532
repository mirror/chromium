      "message": "I just wanted to point out https://crbug.com/722409 which describes a race where some browser/product code (on another thread) tries to check if a feature is enabled (accessing the global FeatureList singleton) and in parallel the test code overwrites the FeatureList singleton.  OTO, maybe the race is rare enough that this shouldn\u0027t be a concern (or maybe the race cannot happen at this point in the test - if no other thread wants to access the features list at this point).",
