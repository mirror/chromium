      "message": "Can you add a comment to explain why the raw pointer usage is fine here?\n\nIIUC, it\u0027s fine because even though PreresolveJob can outlive PreresolveInfo, it\u0027s only accessed on this context through a task that takes a WeakPtr to PreconnectManager, and PreresolveInfo lifetime is tied to PreconnectManager.\n\nIs it correct?",
