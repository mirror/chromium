      "message": "This is a post task because this is being constructed on the main thread? And the VideoFrameSubmitter only runs on the media thread?\n\nDoes this need to use the submitter\u0027s weak pointer? Can the submitter end up being destroyed before this post task runs? Or, because this VideoFrameCompositor owns this submitter, then the weak pointer will be null if the submitter is destroyed? (I think Initialize dchecks a member first before checking the weak pointer.)",
