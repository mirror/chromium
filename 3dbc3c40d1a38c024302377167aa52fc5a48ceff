      "message": "Oh forgot to comment about this before. It\u0027s fine that it is a stub for now, but adding a callback later breaks the backwards-compatibility. Can you change this to\n\n  Connect@0() \u003d\u003e ();\n\n? That way we can keep moving forward with no breakages. Or you can even make it\n\n  Connect@0() \u003d\u003e (handle client_handle);\n\nto avoid amending it later.",
