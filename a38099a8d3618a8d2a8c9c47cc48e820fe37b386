When the user refreshes a page, a new navigation will be created, it will have a new navigationId and the bit will be unset. I\u0027ll add a test for this scenario.\n\nThe sRunningApplicationStart bit is also unset when we start 2nd navigation in ChromeTabbedActivity.createTabModelSelector and it happens before StartupPageLoadMetricsObserver.onNewNavigation() is called.",

      "message": "does that mean it waits for a contentful paint of an http(s) page, or does it record nothing for those startups? If it\u0027s the latter, could you say something like \"It is not recorded when the first loaded page is non http(s)...\". If it\u0027s the former then you\u0027d have to make that clearer somehow.\n\nI notice from the CL description it\u0027s the same condition as ...NavigationCommit, but I find the comment for that histogram more confusing somehow.",
