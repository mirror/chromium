      "message": "I think it works on Linux because the implicit use_lld\u003dtrue setting gets turned off when targeting NaCl as a result of the change that I made in version 2 of this patch.\n\nIt seems like we probably want an !is_nacl at the point where we use use_debug_fission so that we don\u0027t get -gsplit-dwarf with nacl if the user explicitly sets use_debug_fission to true. I\u0027ll prepare a CL that does that.",
