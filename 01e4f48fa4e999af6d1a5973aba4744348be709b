      "message": "When I tested it, the new menu would always be modal and centered. It would animate to the center from the click position. In either case, it wasn\u0027t very desktop-like. The goal as I understood it is to look more like desktop.\n\nI\u0027m okay if we want to change this later. Especially because we are missing the link destination being displayed when hovered.",
