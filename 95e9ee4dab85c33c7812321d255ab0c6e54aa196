Might be worth mentioning how this works in the comment on active_sandbox_flags().\n\nYes, this should include *all* sandbox flags currently active in the frame, including those set by CSP. The comment in frame_replication_state.h already has the text:\n\n  // Contains the currently active sandbox flags for this frame, including flags\n  // inherited from parent frames, the currently active flags from the \u003ciframe\u003e\n  // element hosting this frame, as well as any flags set from a\n  // Content-Security-Policy HTTP header.\n\nbut I\u0027ll add something similar to frame_tree_node.h.\n\n \n\u003e I wonder if it makes sense now to also enforce that the renderer doesn\u0027t lie about its sandbox flags.

At least the main dispatch from DocumentLoader::InstallNewDocument happens after DidCommitNavigation dispatches the DidCommit.  Are you thinking of another case that makes this possible?  Perhaps from Document::InitSecurityContext with non-default policy, related to my question there?\n\nI\u0027d have expected we can away just by doing the is_active() check in DidSetFramePolicyHeaders.  That\u0027s similar to what we already do in similar places in RFHI, and it should prevent a RFH that\u0027s just become pending-delete from overwriting the current frame\u0027s frags.  If we also needed to prevent the race above, we could instead check against the RFHI against current_frame_host(), which should also prevent a pending RFH from overwriting the FTN flags before committing.  But it seems it\u0027d be nicer to instead find a way to just always send DidSetFramePolicyHeaders after (or as part of) commit.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e - would we ever need to query sandbox flags on a pending delete RFH?

It really did seem like incorporating it into the FrameReplicationState was the right thing to do, though :(\n\nI think we do want to send it as part of FRS, so I guess the question is whether we need to also save a copy in RFHI.  Navigations or form submissions should already be blocked in unload handlers on the renderer side, and I think we\u0027ll uniformly ignore them on the browser side as well (see is_active check in RFHI::OnBeginNavigation).  Maybe we can postpone copying the active flags into RFHI until there\u0027s a need for it.  I can\u0027t think of one right now - the two places that check the flags in the browser process seem to be for a navigation and a window.open, which shouldn\u0027t happen from an unload handler.",
