      "message": "I ran some experiments locally by adding counters to all attributes/methods, and it looks the overhead of calling the attribute/method counter is relatively large, and the times measured are inflated and noisy because of that (the total time measured for one particular attribute setter went from ~6 ms with just the bindings counter to ~12 ms with both counters. This makes the times measured by both counters unreliable (and incorrect), so I think I agree with you, I will remove the attribute/method counter.",
