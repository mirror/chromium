      "message": "I hadn\u0027t tried that because I didn\u0027t know about \"/slow\" (thanks!).\n\nI did now, and it doesn\u0027t work quite as suggested. Apparently DocumentAvailableInMainFrame can fire before that slow script finishes loading. What does seem to work is navigating to \"/slow\" directly; I\u0027ve added that as a separate test.\n\nGenerally, I find it cleaner to explicitly wait for the desired event, rather than adding some arbitrary timeout/delay, though admittedly it does make the test code a lot simpler here. OTOH it delays the test by a second, which isn\u0027t ideal.\nAnyway, I think there\u0027s some value in both variants, so how about just keeping both?",
