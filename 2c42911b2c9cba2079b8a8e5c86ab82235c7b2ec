      "message": "Thanks. One subtlety is that I don\u0027t think cloning is strictly necessary: things seemed to work without cloning. This is probably just because all the callsites currently don\u0027t need it. I think there can be no blobs so no data pipes in navigation requests, so the history_serialization and RenderFrameImpl::NavigateInternal callsites never hit this code. The service_worker_context_client one doesn\u0027t need it since it doesn\u0027t reuse request_body after passing the WebHTTPBody to the service worker. However things are less error-prone if we just respect the constness of |input|. I wrote a comment to that effect.",
