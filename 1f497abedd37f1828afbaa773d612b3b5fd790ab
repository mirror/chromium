      "message": "I realize there is some weirdness in the incongruity between having one \"allow\" and one \"disallow\" feature. My thinking is, it\u0027s weird for the bindings generator to need a special flag just to operate normally. So if we wanted to be consistent, I\u0027d prefer for these to both be \"disallow\" settings, and I didn\u0027t think changing the native_structs option here made sense.\n\nAlternatively I could merge them into one dedicated setting \u0026 flag like [--]for_internal_bindings or something.\n\nWDYT?",
