      "message": "The last 2 crash keys are either 1) global data or 2) data specific to RenderProcessHost being killed.  So - maybe these 2 crash keys would be useful for *all* kills done via content::ReceivedBadMessage and therefore could be set by implementation of content::ReceivedBadMessage (OTOH, the BrowserMessageFilter-flavoured overload doesn\u0027t seem aware of RenderProcessHost...).  Also - in the future we might add other RPH-based data (SiteInstance?  dedicated to CWS/extensions/safe-browsing-jail?).\n\nI also wonder if something like |requested_origin| and |requested_url| are commonly known for various flavours of renderer kills - maybe these could be optional parameters of content::ReceivedBadMessage (which could then log them as crash keys if present).\n\nWDYT?",
