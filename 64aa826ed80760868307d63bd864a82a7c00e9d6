      "message": "I don\u0027t think this provides the correct multiplier. My understanding is that this multiplier is applied directly to the output samples (since it works the same way as the per-stream volume multiplier). So a value of 0.5 cuts the output amplitude in half.\n\nHowever, a volume limit of 0.5 should mean \"make sure the maximum output volume of this stream is no greater than the output volume at 0.5\" - so if the volume curve is linear in dB and goes from -60dB to 0dB, then 0.5 is 30dB quieter than 1.0, which is a multiplier of 0.03 (assuming the current volume is 1.0).\n\nAs you have it now, it can only be correct if the volume curve on your device is linear in amplitude - which seems unlikely since it is a bad UX for volume control.",
