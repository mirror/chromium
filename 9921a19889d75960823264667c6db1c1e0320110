      "message": "When I first read this, I had trouble parsing (not with-standing lines 35-37) due to context shift. It might also be due to the naming of \"cert_policy_compliance\" which was a holdover from the EV policy distinction.\n\nConceptually, we could say\nct_policy_compliance\nct_policy_compliance_required\n\nAnd express the same thing, right?\n\nAnd the \"cert_policy_required\" was meant to express symmetry with \"cert_policy_compliance\", but it trips me up because, well, cert policies are also a thing (and was what I was context shifting from a discussion about)\n\nOne option is the wholescale rename (which may not be clarifying for others, and maybe just me), another might be policy_compliance_required\n\nDoes that work/express the same thing?",
