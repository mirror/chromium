So editing replacement must be different, I just don\u0027t see how.\n\nCould this be the ReplaceFontSizeByKeywordIfPossible line?\n\nDo you know what ReplaceFontSizeByKeywordIfPossible is doing?",

      "message": "I think ReplaceFontSizeByKeyboard does some logic to see if we can use \"small\", \"medium\", \"large\", etc. as the size instead of a number. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s related.\n\nThe issue is that ReplaceSelectionCommand doesn\u0027t just apply text replacements, it can also paste in rich content, and it might need to change it to make it match the existing style (if the \"match style\" option is enabled). Perhaps there\u0027s some shortcut we could apply for a plain text insertion, but I don\u0027t think it would really solve the problem in general.\n\nThe end of ReplaceSelectionCommand::DoApply() calls CompleteHTMLReplacement(). If the \"match style\" option is enabled, this calls ApplyStyle() using the EditingStyle we have here to make sure the new text has the correct style.\n\nSomewhere in ApplyStyleCommand, there\u0027s some logic that checks if there\u0027s inline style around us that we need to manipulate (I assume there\u0027s some case involving rich content insertion where this is necessary). In our case:\n\n\u003cdiv contenteditable\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: 12px;\"\u003efoo bar\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e,\n\nthere is indeed inline style involved. So I think there\u0027s a check that says \"do the properties on the inline style match the computed values we slurped into EditingStyle? If not, we need to break the node up, and put our own value on the new text.\" 12px does not match the computed value if text autosizing is enabled, so ApplyStyleCommand applies the larger computed size to the new text.",
