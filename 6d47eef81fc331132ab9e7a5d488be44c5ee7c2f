      "message": "Yes. This is the intended behavior. We only consider GestureScrollBegin. So any update until the very next GestureScrollEnd will be sent to any node whose customization matches the direction of GestureScrollBegin.\n\nOne other alternative would have been to do per-GSUpdate filtering. But that might lead to some complications. For example, what if we start vertical and then go horizontal. The scrolling for A and C will not have a GSB. Also, how call GSE for such gestures is unclear.\n\nA third option would have been inserting GSE + GSB whenever the direction of update changes (to dissect a gesture into a series of up,down, left, and right gestures. But that would maybe break stuff (i.e., multiple gesture scroll begins before user lifts their finger).\n\nThere is some comments about this in the document. But the doc is google.com only.\nmajidvp@: I think we should make it available to chromium.org and add the link to the CL?",

      "message": "\u003e You shouldn\u0027t need to separate the None case explicitly here - it\u0027ll be handled correctly by the bitfield check.\n\nYes agreed. I ended up simplifying this whole method quite a bit; starting with the fact that we do not actually need |scroll_state|. I am passing the direction now. This would save computing it every time for each node on the scroll chain.\n\n\u003e Auto would as well except for the case where deltaX and deltaY are both \u003c the epsilon. Do we really want to start a scroll phase if the delta hint has no direction?\n\nThis was intentional originally. Please look at scroll_customization.cc and the new definition of GetScrollCustomizationForDirection().\n\nEssentially, there is a bunch of places where delta hints are 0 -- most important of all is \u0027touch-scroll-customization.html\u0027 which uses eventSender.gestureScrollBegin (it does not take deltas).\n\nAt first I tried changing eventSender so that delta hints could be passed as arguments. This revealed another problem however: in ScrollManager::CanScroll we currently return true \u0027true\u0027 when hints are zero. Because of that, all the \u003cdiv\u003e\u0027s in touch-scroll-customization.html end up on the scroll chain automatically (while they shouldn\u0027t have normally since their scrollTop and scrollLeft are not properly setup for the purpose). I talked to sahel@ about this and apparently this problem exists in some \"20 or so layout tests\". So removal of the early return code in CanScroll() should perhaps be done in another CL. Also, to modify \u0027touch-scroll-customization.html\u0027 such that it won\u0027t rely on deltas \u003d 0 proved to be problematic as the tests in the file might need to be adjusted accordingly -- perhaps even moved to using gpuBenchmarking.pointerActionSequence might lead to a re-write of most of the tests.\n\nTo conclude the story, I now duplicated the hack (:P) in scroll_customization.cc where we decide the direction is kAuto when deltas are zero. I am happy to followup on this matter in an upcoming patch and revise touch-scroll-customization.html for that matter.",
