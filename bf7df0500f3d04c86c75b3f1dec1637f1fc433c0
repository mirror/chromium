      "message": "i think it mostly depends on what it\u0027s being used for. as i generally understand it, Fake*Client classes are used for two things:\n\n- unit tests\n- OS_CHROMEOS builds of chrome that are being run on developers\u0027 workstations\n\nfor the first case, you\u0027re testing code that uses this class, so you probably want some way to simulate successful calls, calls that return false, and calls that return nullopt (i.e. d-bus error). the usual way to do that is to add a member that contains the result that will be returned, along with a setter like set_result(base::Optional result) that can be called from tests to control the behavior.\n\nfor the second case, i don\u0027t have a good idea about the desired behavior. will this class ever get called in that place, or does ImageLoaderClient only get exercised when running on an actual chrome os device?",

Each method in ImageLoaderClient here is to send a dbus signal to imageloader to invoke its corresponding APIs (RegisterComponent -\u003e RegisterComponent, LoadComponent -\u003e LoadComponent, RequestComponentVersion -\u003e getComponentVersion, etc.). Imageloader (and its dbus API) exists only on a real device. So in the case of running chrome on developers\u0027 workstations, desired behavior is failure due to missing imageloader.",
