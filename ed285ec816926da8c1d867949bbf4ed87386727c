      "message": "Sorry, but you can\u0027t do this either. The very first line of ProcessMinidumpFileFromChild() says base::ThreadRestrictions::AssertIOAllowed() and file I/O is generally not allowed from the UI thread.\n\nYou can\u0027t just take an existing function that\u0027s expecting to run on a specific thread / task runner, and move it to another. That sets off red flags. :) Please carefully consider your threading requirements here. There exists PostTaskAndReply() and PostTaskAndReplyWithResult() functions that may be helpful.",
