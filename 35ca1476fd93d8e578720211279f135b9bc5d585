      "message": "The problem with totally handling the copying of text to the clipboard here instead of in WebPluginContainerImpl.cpp (replacing the Copy() function and creating a PepperWebPluginImpl::ExecuteCopy() similar to ExecuteCut(), which I just added) is that existing code depends on WebPluginContainerImpl::Copy(). \n\nFor instance, I tried locally moving the Copy command into PepperWebPluginImpl and this caused tests in WebPluginContainerTest.cpp to fail (WebPluginContainerTest::Copy, WebPluginContainerTest::CopyFromContextMenu, and WebPluginContainerTest::CopyInsertKeyboardEventsTest).\n\nI\u0027m thinking that we should probably leave Copy() as is, but I can implement the Cut (and Paste) functionality within ppapi using PepperWebPluginImpl::ExecuteEditCommand(). With this change, if we want ExecuteCut() to be independent of the WebPluginContainerImpl::Copy() code, then I can just write directly to the clipboard in this function (see line 417).",
