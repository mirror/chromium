      "message": "Good question. It might not be needed, though I\u0027m not certain (w.r.t. recent \"thread\" -\u003e \"sequence/pool\" cross-cutting changes, it might no longer be needed). It looks like this was originally added in https://codereview.chromium.org/1759193002. I\u0027ll cc+\u003d xhwang@ and land this as-is, though Dale/Xiaohan/You/Me may want to follow-up and remove this.\n\nIs limiting the number of runs here limiting the coverage of the fuzzers? Or is it a negligible overhead (other than possibly code maintenance)?",
