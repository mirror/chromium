I would expect #shouldShowPromo to do checks like the \"isDismissed\" check we have at line 77. \n\nShouldn\u0027t it also check that signin is allowed and that we are not signed in? If that was the case we could remove most of the code we have here and just use that controller instead.",

      "message": "#shouldShowPromo checks if the Finch flag is enabled and if the impression cap was reached for a particular AccessPoint. In this case, there is no impression cap so it merely checks if the Finch flag is enabled. Its general purpose is to decide if the \"Continue as\" promo should have been shown, regardless of it having been dismissed or the user being signed in/signin not being allowed. It is the deciding condition whether several observers (ProfileDataCache.Observer, AccountsChangeObserver) should be registered and whether certain objects related to the \"Continue as\" signin promos should be created (the SigninPromoController, ProfileDataCache etc). \n\nAdding the condition that singin is allowed/user is not signed in would mess up the logic behind the promos in Bookmarks. In BookmarkPromoHeader (https://goo.gl/xP7jMa) #shouldShowPromos decides whether there exists the possibility for the promo to be shown. What I mean by possibility is: even if the user is signed in, we should still initialize the SigninPromoController and register the observers due to the fact that the account may be removed from the device thus having to show the promo immediately.   \n\nRegarding dismissal, so far in Bookmarks we have treated the recording of dismissal \"near\" the place where the recording of the dismissal of the regular promo was done. Adding dismissal in #shouldShowPromo would mean however that we have to do 2 different checks here. ChromePreferenceManager#getNewTabPageSigninPromoDismissed() returns whether the appropriate promo was dismissed and moving the condition in #shouldShowPromo would mean that we would have to do an extra check to figure out which dismissal we need to verify - the old,regular promo or the \"Continue as\" promo - so I don\u0027t know if moving it there would increase readability.\n\nGiven that #shouldShowPromo in this case only checks the Finch flag, I decided to replace every call here with ChromeFeatureList.isEnabled(...) to provide a more clear idea of what is actually checked in the condition. Sorry for the confusion. I\u0027ll also rename this method in a future CL which will modify the \"old\" and \"new\" naming that we\u0027ve used so far across Settings, Bookmarks and Recent Tabs. \n\nIf you think that it would be more appropriate to add the previously discussed conditions in #shouldShowPromo, please let me know and I will modify it :)",
