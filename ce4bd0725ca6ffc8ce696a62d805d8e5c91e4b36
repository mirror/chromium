In this case, there is no impression cap so it merely checks if the Finch flag is enabled. Its general purpose is to decide if the \"Continue as\" promo should have been shown, regardless of it having been dismissed or the user being signed in/signin not being allowed. It is the deciding condition whether several observers (ProfileDataCache.Observer, AccountsChangeObserver) should be registered and whether certain objects related to the \"Continue as\" signin promos should be created (the SigninPromoController, ProfileDataCache etc). \n\nAdding the condition that singin is allowed/user is not signed in would mess up the logic behind the promos in Bookmarks. In BookmarkPromoHeader (https://goo.gl/xP7jMa) #shouldShowPromos decides whether there exists the possibility for the promo to be shown. What I mean by possibility is: even if the user is signed in, we should still initialize the SigninPromoController and register the observers due to the fact that the account may be removed from the device thus having to show the promo immediately.   \n\nRegarding dismissal, so far in Bookmarks we have treated the recording of dismissal \"near\" the place where the recording of the dismissal of the regular promo was done. Adding dismissal in #shouldShowPromo would mean however that we have to do 2 different checks here. ChromePreferenceManager#getNewTabPageSigninPromoDismissed() returns whether the appropriate promo was dismissed and moving the condition in #shouldShowPromo would mean that we would have to do an extra check to figure out which dismissal we need to verify - the old,regular promo or the \"Continue as\" promo - so I don\u0027t know if moving it there would increase readability.\n\nGiven that #shouldShowPromo in this case only checks the Finch flag, I decided to replace every call here with ChromeFeatureList.isEnabled(...) to provide a more clear idea of what is actually checked in the condition.

I\u0027ll also rename this method in a future CL which will modify the \"old\" and \"new\" naming that we\u0027ve used so far across Settings, Bookmarks and Recent Tabs. \n\nIf you think that it would be more appropriate to add the previously discussed conditions in #shouldShowPromo, please let me know and I will modify it :)",

      "message": "notifyItemChanged(int) is deprecated and so I had to use notifyItemChanged(int, PartialBindCallback) instead. At first I tried to update the promo in onBindViewHolder and pass a null PartialBindCallback but this issued an AssertionError here https://goo.gl/uMyV9k (this is the crash log: https://paste.googleplex.com/6312177321377792). I guess that a null PartialBindCallback results in a call to onBindViewHolder() which, by default, calls CardViewHolder#onBindViewHolder, thus registering the object twice. CardViewHolder#onBindViewHolder() is annotated with @CallSuper and therefore we must define some sort of condition which will call CardViewHolder#onBindViewHolder() only once. While finding an appropriate condition is doable, providing a PartialBindCallback solves this issue. For example, if the promo is showing and the account is removed from the device, onBindViewHolder would not be called, notifiyItemChanged(int, PartialBindCallback) using the callback to update the view. This was the best way that I found of handling this problem. Also, I didn\u0027t find any use case where null was passed as a parameter in notifyItemChanged, even though it is marked as @Nullable, so I thought that creating a custom PartialBindCallback was the right approach.",

From my point of view moving onResult implementation to NewPromoViewHolder.onBindViewHolder will make it more readable.\n\nBecause of RecyclerView constraints. \n1. calling notifyItemChanged(0) has a high chance of resulting in the creation of another view and view holder, that the RecyclerView will use for animations when swapping the objects. Calling notifyItemChanged with a payload allows us to do the update in a way that gives us more control.\n2. The view might not be created or attached to the window. Maybe the view got detached or recycled or never instantiated, even though there is a corresponding item in the adapter. If that is the case, the notification just gets dropped and we don\u0027t need to check a bunch of things about the state of the view.\n\nThat being said, I agree the current implementation is not the most obvious and looks wrong inside SigninPromo#onBindViewHolder. How about making the implementation of the update (the content of onResult basically) a method of the PersonalisedViewHolder and just calling that method in onResult? For the view initialisation, just call it in PersonalisedViewHolder#onBindViewHolder. And also you don\u0027t have to keep the reference to the callback.",
