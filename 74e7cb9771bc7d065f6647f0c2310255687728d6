It looks like it\u0027s removing dead code (that information was already being transferred through the ForwardingThrottleDelegate rather than directly through ThrottlingURLLoader ASA URLLoaderThrottle::Delegate) but I wanted to confirm that perspective, and (lower priority) understand why it\u0027s designed that way?",

      "message": "Yeah, it is dead code. When ForwardingThrottleDelegate was introduced (to support multiple throttles), this class no longer needed to be a URLLoaderThrottle::Delegate.\n\nThrottlingURLLoader needs to know which throttle a Pause/ResumeCachingResponseBody call comes from. That is why the signatures different from those of URLLoaderThrottle::Delegate: PauseCachingResponseBody(URLLoaderThrottle* throttle) v.s. PauseCachingResponseBody().",
