      "message": "As we discussed offline, it probably makes more sense to move this logging into PrefetchDownloader, when DownloadService reports the completed download. This will also consolidate 2 reports to the same UMA into one.\n\nSeparately, we can log the success of the task or this reconcile action, as simpler UMA datatype.",
