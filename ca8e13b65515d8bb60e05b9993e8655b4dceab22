      "message": "This change quite changes the definition of SettingsButtonHandler::DELEGATE. There\u0027s three options now:\n\n    NONE (no settings button)\n    TRAY (settings button, opens inline settings)\n    DELEGATE (settings button, opens through delegate)\n\nIn this CL we\u0027re mixing these up by adding a \"more settings\" button. It\u0027s not part of the spec so any of such discussion would definitely have to be ran through hwi@ and sgabriel@, but beyond that, it creates the following situation for MD notifications:\n\n    1. No settings button.\n    2. Settings button -\u003e inline settings for allow/block\n    3. Settings button -\u003e inline settings for allow/block + more settings\n\nThere\u0027s a few questions we have to ask ourselves here. Firstly, is the value added by the \"more settings\" button sufficient to justify the cost? Why would a user click on it? Could we simplify by not including it?\n\nThat\u0027d eventually enable us to rename |settings_button_handler| to |enable_inline_settings| and simply make it a boolean.\n\nSecondly, is this sufficient to replace the context menu? I think we can -- I love it, but again, we should run it through UX when we have a more comprehensive picture of where we\u0027d like to go.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, and also in your CL title, the use of \"tray\" is a bit of a misnomer. We use that to refer to the Chrome OS system tray which has nothing to do with inline settings. Replacing TRAY to INLINE in the enum would help significantly.",
