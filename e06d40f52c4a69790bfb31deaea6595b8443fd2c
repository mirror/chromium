Basically what I\u0027m saying is the pre target EventHandler installed by TrayBubbleView should route KeyEvents to the widget so that accelerators just work without changing these signatures.",

Those are used by tray bubble view to register accelerators at AcceleratorController which is at ash::Shell.",
