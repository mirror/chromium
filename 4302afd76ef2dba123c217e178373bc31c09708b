      "message": "Yes, but it\u0027s about timing. Trying to remove an observer from a deleted PSS turns out to not work very well. I kind of just slapped this where other similar stuff was, although now that you\u0027re questioning this, I don\u0027t see why we\u0027d need to clear fake_server_invalidation_services_ or clients_. Maybe it\u0027s just an artifact of conversions from owning raw pointers to scoped pointers a long time ago.\n\nGoing to remove the two unnecessary ones and then add a comment.",
