      "message": "Same comment as WRT getReceivers(): The order isn\u0027t guaranteed.\n\ngetRemoteStreams() is not in the spec, but it has been around much longer and is very much used. Do you think we should make the order guaranteed and the same as before or let Canary decide if this is a problem or not?\n\nTo have the same order I need to:\n1) Make the order of rtp_receivers_ predictable using a list instead of a map (side-effect: getReceivers() order also becomes fixed).\n2) Make remote_streams a list I add to (if not already added) in a predictable order.",
