      "message": "Managing parallel hierarchy of objects is known to cause greater complexity and is an anti-pattern. I did not look deep into how you manage that parallel universe, but regardless, this is much bigger risk than putting a field on web_contents that does what you need. That is assuming what capabilities of the coordination unit are essential to web contents operation. Performance is.",
