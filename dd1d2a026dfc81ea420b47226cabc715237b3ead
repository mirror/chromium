I\u0027m having a hard time understanding this code and how it\u0027s safe_to_compare_to_empty_or_deleted (per DefaultHash\u003cblink::DecoderCacheKey\u003e), and in particular who resets the fields of DecoderCacheKey, if that\u0027s what happens.",

      "message": "To be explicit: I could approve this if the only change were to the comparison of value.alpha_option_. Also, you could consider adding a kIllegalAlphaOption to ImageDecoder.h and using that only in ConstructDeletedValue and here; that would also seem safe (and would eliminate the static_cast).",
