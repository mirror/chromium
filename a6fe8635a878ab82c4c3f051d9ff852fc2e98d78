You meant to say fill if the frame was independent, but here you\u0027re filling if the frame was *not* independent.\n\nA test would have caught this.\n\nI think this line (even corrected) is unnecessary, though. rows_decoded will be set to image_info.height() if there was a required frame, so we\u0027ll call ZeroFillFrameRect with an empty rect, which will (correctly) do nothing.",
