      "message": "Design question: Curious why an untyped enum versus a constexpr. Per https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Use_of_constexpr it seems like you\u0027d be able to declare this constexpr and have it assigned in the header (e.g. without having to split)\n\nComment nit: It seems like it\u0027d be appropriate to mention this value may be histogrammed? I\u0027m curious in the context of service_worker_metrics, because now that ceiling value is derived from this, so changing this is not \u0027free\u0027 (nor obvious the impact)",
