It\u0027s a nice to have, since this will still work without it, but for now, it just needs to be called out in the comments in PreviewsUserData.\n\nIt\u0027s really hard to find out here whether offline previews is enabled or not, since they use a backdoor multi-threaded approach rather than the ChromeNavigationData approach.",
