E.g. it also means there are multiple ContextMenuDelegate and two places where a RenderViewContextMenuBase could be stored.\n\nThe best approach I see is to last_focused_view_tracker_ and the logic surrounding it into a new class that ChromeWebContentsViewDelegateViewsMac and ChromeWebContentsViewDelegateViews can share.\n\nThen ChromeWebContentsViewDelegateViews can remain aura-specific, and we don\u0027t need #ifdef.",
