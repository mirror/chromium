      "message": "I like this more!\n\nOne question for you and possibly jtinker@: What does release() do exactly? I don\u0027t see much documentation on this method:\n\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaCrypto.html#release()\n\nThe reason I am asking is that after this call, MediaCodec could still be configured with the MediaCrypto object. What\u0027s gonna happen if we still try to decrypt/decode encrypted buffers in MediaCodec? Ideally we should get NO_KEY exception in that case.",

      "message": "MediaCrypto.release() causes the native resources associated with the java MediaCrypto object to be deleted. If the codec has been stopped or reset, it will no longer have an associated MediaCrypto object, so there will be no problem with any operations performed on it. If the codec is still in the running state and you call queueSecureInputBuffer) you will get an IllegalArgumentException.",
