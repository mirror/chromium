I don\u0027t see much documentation on this method:\n\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaCrypto.html#release()\n\nThe reason I am asking is that after this call, MediaCodec could still be configured with the MediaCrypto object. What\u0027s gonna happen if we still try to decrypt/decode encrypted buffers in MediaCodec? Ideally we should get NO_KEY exception in that case.",
