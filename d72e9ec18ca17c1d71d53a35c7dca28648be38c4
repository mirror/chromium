Added extra paranoia.\n\nThough I\u0027m not sure I want to live in this world anymore if pages become \u003c4K...\nInstead of dealing with non-4K pages, we just give up, as this would cause problems in all the tools around it as well. Fortunately, we should be fine unless we start shipping on UltraSPARC or Alpha.\nDone.",
