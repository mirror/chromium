For people that are coming back to chrome but maybe not finding bookmarks, this might be a good thing.\n\nBut, this is fine as well and we can refine in the future if needed.\n\nOr do we not have a shared pref for whether the promo is shown, so this is the best way we know that we aren\u0027t double showing the promo?",
