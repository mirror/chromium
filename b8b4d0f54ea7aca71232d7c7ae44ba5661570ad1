      "message": "The original code was reverted not by mistake but because \nthere were no devices in use with this planarity - so this \nwas tantamount to dead code. Back in the day also the \nlinuxtv.org test code (i.e. vivi and the likes) didn\u0027t \nproperly cover multiplanar YUV formats. So, before landing\ncode we need make sure that it\u0027s properly used and tested;\nI see you found some Qualcomm cameras using this format, so\nthat\u0027s good -- but somehow we need to make sure that this \ncode is tested on the trybots and, if possible, in the CQ\n(via unittests and also via some kind of OS emulator).",

      "message": "I agree with mcasas@ that we need this to be covered by automated tests.\n\nIn order to test this without requiring actual camera hardware or OS emulators, one possibility I see would be to mock out all of the V4L2 API calls and then configure the mock to behave like we expect V4L2 to behave on real hardware. \nmcasas@: Would you see this as an acceptable option?\n\nIf we need coverage on real hardware, we could check if there is a way to add a webrtc bot running on a device using one of these Qualcomm chips.\nzonque@: Could you share more details on particular devices that could be used for such tests?",
