(or maybe as a member function of ServerWindowDrawnTrackerTest, so that the counter gets reset for each test)",

      "message": "Some comments: (1) I think it\u0027s better to update DefaultAccessPolicy::IsValidIdForNewWindow() (2) the client is never told about its own client-id. So it should not be able to set the client id correctly. So instead of checking against |client_id_|, it should really check that the client-id is set to zero. (3) if we do check for zero, then I don\u0027t think you need to check GetWindowByClientId() anymore. You can just do a DCHECK() instead.",
