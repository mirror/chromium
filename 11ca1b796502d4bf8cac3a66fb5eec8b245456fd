Why can\u0027t we just make decision like\n\n1) If there was no display, nor only internal displays,\n   check newly connected displays has mixed state (mirror/extended), go mirror\n2) If there was external display connected, and new display(s) are connected,\n   use current state.\n3) Removal and addition can happen at the same time. In this case:\n   * If it\u0027s removed to internal only, then added,\n      make decisions based on news line like 1)\n   * If it\u0027s removed to single display, then added, use that display\u0027s mode.\n   * If it\u0027s removed to zero, then added, use 1)",
