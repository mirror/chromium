The registry will be black and not visited again. The stack will not be visited again (https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/html/custom/CustomElementReactionStack.cpp?l\u003d36) and anything reachable would not be seen.\n\nI agree that it\u0027s weird but this one should have a manual WB in the current design as far as I can see.",
