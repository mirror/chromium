      "message": "ya, this actually feels very similar to navigate test, it\u0027s kind of annoying to refactor this into a rule for both NavigateTest and this.\n\nI think a better strategy is to just parameterize NavigateTest to run in both chrome home and non-chrome-home",

The difference between how the two tests focus, and what they wait for before typing is too different that there would be if conditions which aren\u0027t great for parameterizing.\n\nPerhaps some larger refactoring could be done, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s worth effort for this limited amount of code.",
