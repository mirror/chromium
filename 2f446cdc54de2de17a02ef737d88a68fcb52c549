      "message": "free-ish... it still adds a command, goes through the CanWaitUnverifiedSyncToken dance, and does the WaitNonThreadSafe on the service side (which takes a lock, does a map lookup, etc.). It doesn\u0027t amount to a lot individually, but across all resources it could add up a bit, I guess. That\u0027s opposed to just setting a flag.\n\nIf you don\u0027t think it\u0027s important, I\u0027m not going to block this, but I think it\u0027s worth double-checking.",
