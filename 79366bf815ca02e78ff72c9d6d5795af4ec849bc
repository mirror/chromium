I would double check a WebGL test case and make sure resuming / re-creating the other contexts works as expected (the WebGL stuff is preserved / still works).",

      "message": "Hopefully this won\u0027t limit the effectiveness of this workaround too much. I had been hoping that we could start to send back the information through the system that the forthcoming WebGL context loss event was expected, rather than accidental. However, this\u0027ll be a larger change and may happen anyway due to other work in http://crbug.com/681341, so avoiding lost context notifications for WebGL seems like a good start.",
