In the common case, query performance is unlikely to be sufficiently higher than std::map to make a difference, insert performance is slightly worse, and the memory overhead is high. This makes sense mostly for large tables where you expect a lot of lookups.\n\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/base/+/master/containers/",
