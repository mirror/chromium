      "message": "WindowAndroidCompositor is not a thing on unfortuantely webview, so how would any of this work on webview?\n\nThe existing way to position dialogs against the \"local\" view is \"anchor views\", which are basically just child views added to the container view, then I think dialog can just position itself where the anchor view is supposed to be. I guess that kind of defeats the whole purpose of dialogsurface?\n\nHow about just asking the container view where it is in screen location then?",
