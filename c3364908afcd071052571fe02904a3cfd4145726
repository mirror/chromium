      "message": "nit: Normally I would suggest to inline this and rename to destination_path(). But as it is only used in tests, I suggest keeping it out of line and rename to GetDestinationPathForTesting. An ideal test would just work with the public production methods of the class, but I agree that there is no other good way to identify a particular instance, so this is fine. Calling it \"ForTesting\" helps preventing a bad use of the class in production (such as asking it for the FilePath and then writing data outside of the Write method).",

Also, I would try to make it clearer which questions the comments are trying to answer (what it |task_runner_| for? and why have a dedicated one?), for example like:\n\n// |task_runner_| is used for time-consuming tasks during exporting. The tasks will dereference a WeakPtr to |*this|, which means they all need to run on the same sequence.",
