      "message": "I should have suggested:\n     Layer()-\u003eSetNeedsRepaint();\n\nI just noticed an issue about change of interest rect when scroll offset changes. In SPv1 we check change of interest rect in GraphicsLayer/CompositedLayerMapping, but we lack the check in SPv2. The easist way (which I also suggest for now) is to just call Layer()-\u003eSetNeedsRepaint() without any condition here. For optimization, we may need a new flag on PaintLayer to indicate probable interest rect changes, and skip repaint if interest rect doesn\u0027t change.",

This was tested by PaintControllerPaintTestForSlimmingPaintV2.BlockScrollingNonLayeredContents but was masked by over-invalidation.\n\nI\u0027ve updated this code to always call \"Layer()-\u003eSetNeedsRepaint();\" but have written it in a way that makes the interest rect requirement obvious.",
