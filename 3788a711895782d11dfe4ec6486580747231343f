      "message": "Since you still need to override AnimationPlayer, it doesn\u0027t seem like abstracting the timing model here has saved anything and just causes more vtable lookups. Wouldn\u0027t it make sense to just override the part of AnimationPlayer::TickAnimations which loops over the animations to use a custom time for worklet animation players?",
