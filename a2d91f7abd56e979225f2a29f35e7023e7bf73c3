      "message": "\u003e Do Chromium branded official builds work at all?\n\nYes they do.  I was just able to build chromium-browser*.deb with a hack to include this file in the build (normally the targets are inaccessible because this file is unreferenced when is_chrome_branded\u003dfalse).\n\nThat sort of begs the question: how come the condition to build the installers is is_chrome_branded and not !is_component_build?  I think the answer is: we don\u0027t want the packages getting included in the gn \"all\" target on every run of linux_chromium*rel_ng.  I think this suggests what we really want is an enable_linux_packages gn argument. wdyt?\n\n\u003e I\u0027m not sure if anyone is using that or not.",
