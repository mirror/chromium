      "message": "It\u0027s a bit weird to make BrowserPolicyConnectorBase inheriting from this tiny interface. The PolicyConnector class is basically a root which holds all the rest of the policy stack, and it seems abusive to say that it\u0027s also a handler for some small and specific task like error logging.\n\nWith the assumption that the LogErrors() code returns back to ConfigurationPolicyPrefStore, I see two alternatives here:\neither 1) find another class that exposes an observer interface for the ResourceBundle construction (or anything after that, e.g. PreCreateThreads() finished, etc.),\nor 2) make BrowserPolicyConnectorBase expose a simple observer interface for the ResourceBundle construction event (a method with a callback parameter would be sufficient).\n\nI\u0027d say that #1 sounds cleaner - however I didn\u0027t succeed in finding a very good candidate. If you don\u0027t have an idea either, then #2 should also work.",
