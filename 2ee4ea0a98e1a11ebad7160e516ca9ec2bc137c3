      "message": "Some questions (mainly for my understanding) :)\n1) With this change, when the event time is out-of-date, a new frame will still be delivered later. Is this expected?\n\n2) For |kPassiveRefreshRequest| event, ObserveEventAndDecideCapture() returns false when the source content has been changed. Should we still enable the delayed refresh in this case? Will there be an active refresh request coming later?\n\n3) How about |kMouseCursorUpdate| event? Should we do same logic?",
