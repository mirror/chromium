The one ones seem like external factors could result in the list being updated, but this seems slightly different.\n\nI wonder if we could tweak this to instead pass a org.chromium.base.Callback\u003cString\u003e into serializePasswords and have that pass the callback through the native chain and then you can even call onResult from native through RunCallbackAndroid in callback_android.h.",

      "message": "from my other comment about Callback\u0027s from java, I think you\u0027d just pass a ScopedJavaGlobalRef wrapped version of the java callback passed down to this method and use it in Post.\n\n(this is what immediately comes to mind for something like this: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/ui/android/context_menu_helper.cc?q\u003dcontext_menu_helper.\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d236)\n\nThe nice thing about this is that you \"could\" support multiple serialize calls and the client wouldn\u0027t have to disambiguate since it would be associated with a specific callback.",
