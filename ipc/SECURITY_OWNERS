# Changes to IPC messages require a security review to avoid introducing sandbox
# escapes. Code that uses shared memory also needs review from a security owner.
#
# Security team: If you are uncomfortable reviewing a particular bit of code
# yourself, don't hesitate to seek help from another security team member!
# Nobody knows everything, and the only way to learn is from experience.
