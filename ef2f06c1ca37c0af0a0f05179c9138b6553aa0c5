      "message": "The race condition is between opening the NTP and finishing async request to Offline Page model to determine whether a URL is prefetched. I assume that manually opening a suggestion is not comparable to opening the NTP and, thus, should be fine.\n\nUPD: I measured time on Micromax (but only on Popular Sites, because it does not have internet). The delay between asking the model and obtaining results is 0.7-1.5 seconds. However, the input is blocked longer than that. My best click was 0.25 seconds after obtaining results, but I was violently clicking all the time during the NTP opening, so this looks ok for me and I will probably leave it as it is.",
