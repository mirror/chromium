I\u0027m not sure what the plan is for those UI elements and Mustash but I was under the impression that this code already worked fine with MUS.\n\nFyi, unlike a traditional HW cursor, this cursor implementation is closely tied to WM and UI code and can as a result easily support all kinds of accessibility features that we rely on a SW cursor for today. It\u0027s faster than the current SW cursor as it uses the fast ink rendering mechanism we developed for zero-latency stylus.",
