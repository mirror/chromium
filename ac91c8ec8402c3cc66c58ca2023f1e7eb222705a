      "message": "Just had a couple lint-related thoughts:\n1: We should get rid of tools-lint and go back to using the copy in tools. We created this originally because the sdk was accidentally shipping stale versions of lint, but I think that\u0027s been resolved.\n2: I think the reason we\u0027ve had trouble with lint \u0026 platform-tools being out of sync is that lint needs platform-tools/api/ to be rolled to the latest. We should be able to roll just this subdirectory of platform-tools before the rest of platform-tools, as I think lint is the only thing that uses it.",
