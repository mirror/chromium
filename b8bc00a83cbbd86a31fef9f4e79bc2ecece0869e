      "message": "You are right. However, hit testing as written here is a best effort/best match search. We can have multiple nodes that match a hit point. The idea here is to find something that mtaches better than an offscreen or partially offscreen node.\n\nIn practice, the example I\u0027m working with is Google search which uses a partially offscreen node that is also 800x1800 (essentially the entire page). At some point, we might want some notion of z-order as well. Until then, I think this is good for now considering performance.",
