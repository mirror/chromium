      "message": "Again I\u0027m not sure after further research (summarized in comment above) whether renaming this class is warranted. If we were to rename perhaps we should just call it \u0027PendingAnimations\u0027.\n\nBut, in fact, it is considering all animations \"in the light of\" whether they need something related to the compositor to be taken into account.\n\nIt is just that, it considers all animations, not just those that actually *do* have some compositor interaction needed. So that can be surprising to an eng depending on how they read/interpret the class name.",
