      "message": "Composited, non-remote frames do not adjust the size or positions of their composited layers\nto include transform. Instead, they draw at their non-transformed resolution, and the\nresult is composited onto the screen with transforms.\n\nTherefore I think your CL is on the right track. I think it\u0027s correct to not scale the\nframe rect to include transform of content. However, I don\u0027t think it is correct to apply\nthe transform to the location of this frame rect either.\n\nIt seems to me that the remote-frame representation of a sub-frame w/transform should be equivalent to the local-frame \u0026 composited one, in that the position of the contained surface for the remote iframe should not include transform.",
