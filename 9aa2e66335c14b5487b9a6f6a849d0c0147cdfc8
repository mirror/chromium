Is that intentional? I would\u0027ve thought that a runner could have multiple children?\n\nIf the intent is in fact to disable after the first (only?) call, could you add a comment here, since at it is now, it\u0027s a little bit confusing, since most APIs are symmetric related to starting and stopping, etc.",
