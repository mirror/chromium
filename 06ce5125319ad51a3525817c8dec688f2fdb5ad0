      "message": "MapToVisualRectInAncestorSpace requires a bit of finessing to get it to convert all the way to physical pixels. I wonder if something like the following would be more robust? This relies on IntersectionObserver which is sort of a wrapper around MapToVisualRectInAncestorSpace and is pretty well tested:\n\n#include \"core/layout/IntersectionGeometry.h\"\n...\nIntersectionGeometry geometry(nullptr, *ToElement(layout_svg_root_.GetNode()), Vector\u003cLength\u003e(), true);\ngeometry.ComputeGeometry();\nLOG(INFO) \u003c\u003c \"intersection rect: \" \u003c\u003c geometry.IntersectionIntRect().ToString();\n\nIntersectionObserver is particularly useful for ads so it actually clips to the viewport which is a little different than your heuristic to not include scrolling, but it might be an easier starting point.",
