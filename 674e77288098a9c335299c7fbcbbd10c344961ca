      "message": "Hmm honestly all this logic is very hard to reason about.\nI personally find challenging having to deal with \u003e1 atomic variable.\nMy humble suggestion would be to use a mutex here, or you might end up having to debug this code for quite long time.\nAlso consider that a mutex, when not hit, is really an atomic increment + decrement, and here you have accumulated way more atomic ops than that, so it might even just be more performant.\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, I am not saying this is wrong. I am just saying that I can\u0027t tell what\u0027s going to happen in all the possible linearizations, and the fact itself that you had to put a MemoryBarrier() above might be a red flag.\n\nI\u0027d say either find a way to do all this with one atomic variable, or put a mutex and live happy :)",
