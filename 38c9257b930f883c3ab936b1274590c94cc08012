On the other hand, I\u0027m not convinced that making this a ref counted type and having the Receiver intermediate class is worth the trouble, if the main goal is avoiding a delete this in OnConnectionError(). As you point out, the forwarding indirection is a bit clumsy. I\u0027m starting to become accustomed to bare `delete this` when bindings_ is empty...\n\nI\u0027m tending to think this should just do `delete this` until there is something like StrongBindingSet which is really a strong binding.",
