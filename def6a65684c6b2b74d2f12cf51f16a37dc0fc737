      "message": "mac_views_browser\u003d1 actually doesn\u0027t have a milestone yet. you could be waiting a long time :/\n\nWhat _does_ have a milestone (currently m66) is --enable-features\u003dSecondaryUiMd which enables a bunch of secondary UI on Mac to use Views instead of Cocoa, but not the main browser window.\n\nbut unless you are trying to modify chrome/browser/ui/views/browser_view and its subviews (toolbar, omnibox, etc.) I don\u0027t think you actually need to depend on mac_views_browser\u003d1. \n\nTBH I think all your stuff should Just Work on Mac (you don\u0027t even need --enable-features\u003dSecondaryUiMd).\n\nIt\u0027s true we haven\u0027t played much with views::Webview; it shouldn\u0027t be blocked by mac_views_browser\u003d1, but it might need some tweaks, e.g., to ensure the correct WebContentsViewDelegate is attached.\n\nWhat\u0027s the current set of problems you\u0027re running into on Mac?",

The problem is that //c/b/ui/views/media_router/* won\u0027t link (due to LocationBarView) without toolkit_views.\n\nWe are prepared to wait 3-6 months for mac_views_browser since Mac isn\u0027t a high priority for this already-low-use feature and we aren\u0027t familiar with Cocoa.",
