It\u0027s using LocationBarView to display a URL, but not much else. You could probably replace it with a views::Label or something, but you\u0027re right that it would be a bunch of work you might not need.\n\n\n\u003e We are prepared to wait 3-6 months for mac_views_browser since Mac isn\u0027t a high priority for this already-low-use feature and we aren\u0027t familiar with Cocoa.\n\ncool!",
