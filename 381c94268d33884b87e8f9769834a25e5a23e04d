For example \n https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/public/platform/WebReferrerPolicy.h?rcl\u003dd1c910879ed03b3016a4f51ca1a1080534e8cbf2\u0026l\u003d42\n\nWebReferrerPolicy {\n  kWebReferrerPolicyAlways,...\n\nWould become WebReferrerPolicy.ALWAYS on the java side.\n\nProbably just a matter of changing startswith to re.match. Then you\u0027ll also have to fix the java side uses (it doesn\u0027t look like there are that many thankfully).",
