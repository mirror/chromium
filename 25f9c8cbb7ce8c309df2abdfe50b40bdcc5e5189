      "message": "@dtapuska: Another thing I wanted to ask about is how to handle this change in the test I added. Because with this approach we no longer have a WebPluginContainerImpl::Cut() function, and WebPluginContainerImpl::ExecuteEditCommand() is called instead, this presents an issue. The TestPluginWithEditableText class that I created is not a pepper web plugin, so the Cut functionality cannot be tested because the WebPlugin::ExecuteEditCommand() is called instead of PepperWebPluginImpl::ExecuteEditCommand(). \n\nWhat do you think would be the best way to handle this?\n\n**Note: the WebPluginContainerTest::CutDeleteKeyboardEventsTest is not passing right now because I wanted to ask you how to approach this before proceeding to edit it.",
