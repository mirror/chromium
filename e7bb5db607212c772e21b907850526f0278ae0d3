Looking at https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL/blob/master/include/gsl/span no such function is present and it seems pretty trivial to do something along the lines of \n\nConstCArray\u003cFoo\u003e new_span(old_span.data() + pos, count);\n\n(as opposed to auto new_span \u003d old_span.subspan(pos, count);)\n\nI\u0027m not too opposed to it here, but it\u0027s something to consider from the minimalistic type of view.",
