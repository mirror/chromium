      "message": "IsIdle() can be true for up to 30 seconds before the timer actually detects idle and calls RequestTermination right? I think we should have a flag or state like requested_termination_ instead of checking IsIdle().\n\nIt\u0027s also kind of confusing terminology. If a worker is \"idle\" I\u0027d expect it to be able to handle events immediately. So I think we should make the distinction between \"idle\" and \"requested termination\" in comments/naming too.",
