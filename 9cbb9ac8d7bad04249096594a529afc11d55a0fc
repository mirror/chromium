If this is acceptable, why wouldn\u0027t we want this behavior in BubbleFrameView itself?\n\nBubbleFrameView is used in DialogDelegate, for tab-modals, which can be user-sizable (e.g. Edit Bookmark on Mac, and (I think) Print Preview).\n\nI\u0027ll check to see if there are any BubbleDialogs using the min size - I can\u0027t think of any that size to anything other than their minimum supported size currently.",

Yeah, I\u0027m pretty sure the min size isn\u0027t used for bubbles, but checking would be nice.\n\nSo.. I found TrayBubbleView :/. It overrides Min/Max sizes.. It also overrides BubbleDialogDelegateView::CreateNonClientFrameView already, but not in way that helps. So I need to do a more thorough search and think up a good plan for moving forward.\n\n(I wonder if the CL owner can remove a reviewers\u0027 +1...)",
