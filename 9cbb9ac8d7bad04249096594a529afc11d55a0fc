If this is acceptable, why wouldn\u0027t we want this behavior in BubbleFrameView itself?\n\nBubbleFrameView is used in DialogDelegate, for tab-modals, which can be user-sizable (e.g. Edit Bookmark on Mac, and (I think) Print Preview).\n\nI\u0027ll check to see if there are any BubbleDialogs using the min size - I can\u0027t think of any that size to anything other than their minimum supported size currently.",
