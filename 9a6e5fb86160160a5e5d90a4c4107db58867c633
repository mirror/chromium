      "message": "i think it\u0027d be better if we could figure out a way to use the typed enum here, for sure. a couple ideas:\n* consider moving the canonical definition of WebFeature to a mojom file (if we\u0027re lucky this could be done transparently, without having to update any existing users of WebFeature)\n* write a script that auto-generates the mojo type mapping code\n* check with the core mojo devs (rockot@ is a good person to ask) to see if there\u0027s a way to retain type safety here. maybe there\u0027s a lighter weight type mapping impl that doesn\u0027t require explicitly enumeriating all 2000 entries for example? seems unlikely but worth asking ken - maybe mojo team could add support for this to help us out.",
