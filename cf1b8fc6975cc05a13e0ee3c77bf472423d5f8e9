On the extension side media source is string, and on the browser side MediaSource is a wrapper class around string/MediaSource::Id.\n\nThe TODO comment below says we can make MediaRoute just hold base::Optional\u003cMediaSource::Id\u003e. At that point I don\u0027t think we need the MediaSource class anymore. Should we simply remove the class and use strings?",
