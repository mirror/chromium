(If we ever might want to subclass it, would \u0027self\u0027 here break it? And would \u0027self\u0027 here work otherwise?) Probably best to leave this as-is (\"page_set\" in the __init__); just thought there might be a way to reduce the repetition in the page list construction, below...",

So the self that is passed in originally was the StorySet\u0027s self, which is a StorySet. This is a Page object, so its \"self\" is a page. We totally can still subclass these pages just fine.
