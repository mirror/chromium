If that\u0027s the case, and if you\u0027re now unconditionally doing a Y flip in GpuMemoryBufferImageCopy::CopyImage, wouldn\u0027t that mean that the image will now be upside down in the Oculus path? Or am I missing something?",

      "message": "This is unpackFlipY\u003dtrue, right?\n\nIt seems a bit surprising to implicitly do a Y flip as part of copying the image here. Would it be clearer to add a flipY boolean arg to this method and use that here?",
