      "message": "createDetached calls detach with null as both the intent and finalizeCallback, so it just adds a TabReparentingParams(this, \u003cnew Intent with just EXTRA_TAB_ID\u003e, null) to the AsyncTabParamsManager.\n\nThis is taken out of the AsyncTabParamsManager in CustomTabActivity#finishNativeInitialization, removed and immediately passed to Tab#attachAndFinishReparenting.\n\nThe only thing Tab#attachAndFinishReparenting does with the params is to call TabReparentingParams#finalizeTabReparenting, which will be a no-op since there\u0027s no finalizeCallback.\n\nSo I don\u0027t think this will break CustomTabs - TabReparentingParams is only used in multiwindow Tab reparenting (and my current FullscreenActivity). I was actually tempted to try to separate the reparenting logic and TabReparentingParams - let whoever is reparenting the Tab worry about them, not the Tab itself. The only reason I didn\u0027t was because I assume that finalizeTabReparenting needs to be called at a certain point in attachAndFinishReparenting (after all the setup but before the Observers are notified).",
