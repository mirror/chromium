      "message": "Note: TBH, this looks slightly weird because we ignore errors to retrieve a param from Response here, unlike other methods... Though this keeps the current behavior (incl. UMA).\n\nBTW, Dan, who should have the responsibility to parse proto?\nIn this case, callers parse it. On the other hand, some other *ClientImpl, like cryptohome, parses it by ObjectProxy::PopArrayOfBytesAsProto().\n\nParsing here may be nicer as we can have type-safeness, while as you wrote in your document,\nwe want to keep the ClientImpl classes thin. So we need some balance.\n\nWDYT?",
