It will be useful to just subclass the autogenerated interceptor and register it to proxy all incoming calls.\nOne subtlety I haven\u0027t solved yet is that being a proxy between the incoming calls and the real implementation causes the forwarding call to be process-local, which means you lose information about who the caller is and process termination doesn\u0027t work. It should be fine to use if that detail doesn\u0027t apply. An example usage is in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/611102. It works, but still leaks memory and could be improved.",

The typical pattern is the receiver side implements the version that returns a result via the callback, while the sender/caller side uses the sync call signature (via the proxy object in the generated mojom)\n\nWe should be able to get this behavior by just binding the interface.
