      "message": "Why do we need this after adding \"CreateNativePixmapForProtectedBufferHandle\"? I was expecting that CreateNativePixmapForProtectedBufferHandle would allow GbmSurfaceFactory to maintain a map between dummy handle and native pixmaps instead of having this callback mechanism. It would be fine to keep a map in the protected buffer manager code too but we\u0027d avoid having to add this callback mechanism here and we\u0027d keep the Ozone API relatively clean.\n\nNot a blocking issue for me but I\u0027d like to understand why this is needed as it seems like removing this would result in a final solution that is only requiring a relatively simple Ozone API change.",
