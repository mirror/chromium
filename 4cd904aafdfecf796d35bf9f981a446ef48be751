      "message": "I agree this would not have been a good idea if this was saying \"return the GEM handle for the pixmap\". But this API is not implying in any way that the id returned is a GEM handle, and the client of this API must not be interpreting it as one. From the point of view of the API client, it is just an arbitrary, abstract unique id of type uint32_t. It\u0027s up to the implementation how to implement an unique int32_t id in a platform-specific way, assuming it meets the conditions described above.\n\nThe security of this solution should also not be a concern, as the security of GEM handles is not based on their values being kept secret, as they are guessable, but on DRM access rights and the fact that they are local to a DRM file. This API is not adding any additional access to GEM/DRM rights on top of what the client might have already had.",
