      "message": "Nit: now that I look at this code again, the calls to Did{Enter,Exit}Fullscreen in Simulate{Enter,Exit}Fullscreen are redundant with the calls to Did{Enter,Exit}Fullscreen in the MockChromeClient above. I think the former predate the latter (which I added to handle cases where a delegate triggers fullscreen, rather than the test triggering fullscreen), and could now be removed. You can probably also remove the ServiceScriptedAnimations from here, if you re-add testing::RunPendingTasks() to wait for the PostTasks you added in the MockChromeClient. But don\u0027t spend too long on this, if it doesn\u0027t work out as expected - the doubled calls to Did{Enter,Exit}Fullscreen predate your patch, and don\u0027t seem to cause problems in practice.",
