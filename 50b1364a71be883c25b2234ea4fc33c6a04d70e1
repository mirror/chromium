      "message": "The loop is to cover the following case:\nSuppose you have a device that exposes one video-input device and two audio-input devices and both audio-input devices have the same group ID because they are in the same device.\n\nIf you have two of those installed in the system there would be 4 audio inputs that match |video_label|, but two group IDs. If we have an if instead of a loop, we might see only one group ID and incorrectly conclude that it is the right group ID for the video device.",
