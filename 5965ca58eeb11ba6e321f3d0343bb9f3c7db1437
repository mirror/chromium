      "message": "This LGTM.\n\nAs for testing I think this test is exercising this codepath: AppBackgroundPageApiTest.OpenThenClose -- but it doesn\u0027t have a path in its web extent. That might be a good starting point.\n\nI think it\u0027s as simple as adding \u0027extensions/api_test\u0027 to the launch.web_url and app.urls of the manifest declared in the C++ code. This test works by loading another extension ( https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/test/data/extensions/api_test/app_background_page/basic_open/test.js ) that launches this hosted app URL: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/test/data/extensions/api_test/app_background_page/common/a.html which does the window.open.",

      "message": "Thanks Nick.\nI confirmed that appending \"extensions/api_test\" to the two URLs suffices to cause the tests to fail with the current code. The change here fixes it. If this is OK with Devlin I\u0027ll leave it at that.",
