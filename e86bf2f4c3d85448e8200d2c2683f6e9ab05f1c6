      "message": "Correct. my counterargument was that |gpu_| is used as a marker to \nprevent several EstablishGpuChannel{Sync}() calls to be run before \nOnEstablishedGpuChannel() has been finalized.  I was just shy of\ntouching the rest of this file.\n\nIIUC, what you propose is to refactor the code to: \na) expect |gpu_| to be potentially initialized and to use it if so,\nb) to not use it as a marker.\n\nSince the path EstablishGpuChannelSync() - OnEstablished...() happens \nin a single thread, there\u0027s no need to use any marker: either the gpu \nchannel is established or not. \n\nFor the async EstablishGpuChannel() --\u003e OnEstablished...(), we can peek \nat the amount of request-gpu-channel-callbacks in flight as proxy of (a)\nEstablishGpuChannel() in flight or not.\n\nWill update the code based on these lines.",
