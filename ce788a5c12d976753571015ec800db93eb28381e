      "message": "I suppose this raises the same question. I\u0027m glad to see we\u0027re using browser process state to tell if it was blocked, at least, since a renderer couldn\u0027t just lie and say it was blocked to get past the CanCommitURL check.  Still, this feels like a hole if the renderer knows of a victim URL that will be legitimately blocked.  That gives them a foot in the door against features that check the last committed URL.",
