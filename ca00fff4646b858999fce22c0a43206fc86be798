It also sounds like WillCommitProvisionalLoad isn\u0027t suitable for the first group\u0027s needs.

Or maybe we could see if the earlier one would work for the two current users of WillCommitProvisionalLoad and simply move them over, letting us keep WillCommit and DidCommit?\n\nIndeed - I haven\u0027t (yet) tried changing the timing of WillCommitProvisionalLoad and it does seem like a promising idea.  Thanks for pointing this out.\n\u003e \n\u003e (Not sure if this is worth pursuing, but I thought I\u0027d point it out as an option to avoid the race concerns.)\n\nThanks for raising this and pointing out that reordering RFO::DidCommitProvisionalLoad can work if we move PLT to a new method like RFO::DidCommitProvisionalLoad_PreIPC.\n\nThe main reasons why I I went ahead with the PostTask approach were\n\n1) Daniel didn\u0027t like the extra RFO method when I mentioned this option on team chat.  OTOH, I didn\u0027t back then consider moving the call to RFO::WillCommitProvisionalLoad to later / to the same time when RFO::DidCommitProvisionalLoad call happens before this CL.\n\n2) Reordering of RFO callbacks won\u0027t help with DevToolsClient::DidClearWindowObject case, because it is trigerred without going through RFO.  I\u0027ve added some more notes in the CR comment in the content/renderer/devtools/devtools_frontend_impl.cc file.\n\nFor now I kept the PostTask approach for the DevTools case, but other than that I switched to the approach that changes the timings of RFO::WillCommit... and RFO::DidCommit... calls (and also removed WebUI test changes that are not needed with this approach).",
