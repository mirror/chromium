      "message": "this inconsistency about the order of changing state and notifying about the changed state makes me uncomfortable.\n\nThat said, the solution might be simpler as EnterStateXXX() is IMO simply a misnomer. Every of the EnterStateXXX does something very specific and not update the state.\nWe should avoid that extra layer of abstraction around state handling and simply rename / inline them, e.g.\n\nEnterStateReady() --\u003e UpdateFetchedCategoryStatusAvailable();\nI\u0027m tempted to move the clear-history-dependent-state out of EnterStateReady() and into this block.\n\nEnterStateDisabled() --\u003e just inline\nEnterStateError() --\u003e just inline",

      "message": "Well, if the provider is not activated (i.e. not ready()), schedule_ is empty. It was always the case and thus the post-poning code in the provider actually never got executed.\n\nI can make it more explicit by introducing a bool provider_is_active_. I had it in the previous version of the CL, only the unit-tests revealed that it is not needed as this is already stored in schedule_ and guarded by the if-statement here.",
