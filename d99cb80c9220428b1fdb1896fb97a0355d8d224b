It was always the case and thus the post-poning code in the provider actually never got executed.\n\nI can make it more explicit by introducing a bool provider_is_active_. I had it in the previous version of the CL, only the unit-tests revealed that it is not needed as this is already stored in schedule_ and guarded by the if-statement here.",
