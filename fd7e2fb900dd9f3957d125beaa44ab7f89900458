      "message": "That right, the method call is dispatched to the receiver object\u0027s relevant realm\u0027s  CredentialsContainer object, so, yes. In fact, if another context stashes away the to the `navigator.credentials` object, the call can be dispatched even long after document detach.\n\nHowever, CheckSecurityRequirementsBeforeRequest(), called on line 390, already checks for this on lines 108-118. At least, my understanding of the shutdown sequence is that resolver-\u003eGetExecutionContext()-\u003eIsContextDestroyed() starts returning `true` strictly before GetFrame() starts returning nullptr, see go/ztlpe.",
