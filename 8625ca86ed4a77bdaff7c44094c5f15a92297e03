      "message": "What puzzles me here is the fact that we are returning true without doing anything to consume it. So we are ignoring these events? Looking at your description makes me think, we were handling them but also bubbling them up as well. So I was expecting to see a super.onGeneric... call here as well.\n\nWhat am I missing?",

      "message": "I learned mouse events are okay to be ignored on Toolbar since touch events are the ones that actually triggers actions like showing menu, invoking tab switcher, etc. Mouse events only matter on content layer since Blink needs to them to handle mouse events properly. Given that, I had them consumed here and didn\u0027t call the super method. Let me know if I got it wrong - would be happy to fix it.",
