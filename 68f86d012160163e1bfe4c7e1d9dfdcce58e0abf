      "message": "Yeah, it looks like LayoutTableCell has offset to the LayoutTableSection it belongs to, while NG fragment offset is always relative to its parent. I\u0027ll need to consult with Ian, David, and a few others. Filed crbug.com/788590 to get their attention.\n\nNote, this issue adds these two lines only. Other differences come from that, in NG, AdjustPaintOffsetScope handles LayoutInline too. I can adjust caller code not to use AdjustPaintOffsetScope for LayoutInline if that is preferred.",
