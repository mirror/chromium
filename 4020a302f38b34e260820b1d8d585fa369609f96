      "message": "Per https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d770924#c11 : could you do the experiment mentioned there with DescheduleUntilFinishedCHROMIUM?\n\nAlso could you see if adding a well-placed Flush into the DrawingBuffer code addresses this issue?\n\nThe scheduling of the VRDisplay sounds a little brittle right now, and though I don\u0027t know this code at all, it seems to me we should be figuring out a more robust mechanism for getting the scheduling you want. It sounds like maybe the app is swamping the GPU due to lack of back-pressure, which is a problem we\u0027ve seen before, and which should probably be handled a little differently than this.\n\nThis is now basically exactly the same loop as just above, which seems wrong somehow.",
