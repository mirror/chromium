      "message": "Could you run the animometer bouncing clips test with gpu raster on and see if this makes a difference one way or the other? I kind of suspect that we\u0027ll need to ignore them.  It\u0027s a little odd though, because we can\u0027t quite replicate what the previous code was doing where the DisplayItem ignored but Skia did not.",

This is SkPathCounter which is what analyzeClipPath uses to count paths:\n\n    void operator()(const SkRecords::ClipPath\u0026 op) {\n        // TODO: does the SkRegion op matter?                                                                    \n        if (op.opAA.aa() \u0026\u0026 !op.path.isConvex()) {\n            fNumSlowPathsAndDashEffects++;\n        }\n    }\n\nNow I understand.. so I ran the benchmark and it appears to be better when we count the slow paths (letting us fall out of gpu raster)?\n\nSoftware raster with clip path counting: 380.28 -3.21% / +2.65%\nGPU raster with clip path counting: 437.61 -6.44% / +4.43%\n\nSoftware raster with 0 clip path: 380.72 -4.12% / +3.55%\nGPU raster with 0 clip path: 408.99 -3.10% / +2.82%",
