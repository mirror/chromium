      "message": "Could you run the animometer bouncing clips test with gpu raster on and see if this makes a difference one way or the other? I kind of suspect that we\u0027ll need to ignore them.  It\u0027s a little odd though, because we can\u0027t quite replicate what the previous code was doing where the DisplayItem ignored but Skia did not.",
