      "message": "I moved this up above the currentRange block. Is it important that it go after?\n\nNote that pre-r483795 there was some logic up here to check if the target was focused. It looks like that logic moved into createTextEditHandlerIfNeeded_ but a) it only checks the parent focus, not the node itself, and b) it\u0027s too late.\n\nI found that my code is still broken if I call this after the currentRange block, but moving it ahead fixes the issue.",
