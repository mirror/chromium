      "message": "Is it possible for the order of views in the model to change even though the bounds for each index don\u0027t change? Could this leave shelf items in the wrong place if they were reordered by dragging or by some item\u0027s status changing (unpinning a running app that was pinned between non-running apps), etc.? I never understood the view model or ideal bounds code well, you might want to ping skuhne@ for review.",

      "message": "Would it make more sense to skip AnimateViewTo on a per-view basis? ie. don\u0027t check if they\u0027re all equivalent and then early return, but check if the new and old ideal bounds for each view are equivalent and then skip the animation for that one view? (I\u0027m not actually sure if that would actually help anything...)",
