      "message": "I tried changing all the tests in this file to use the local state and user pref services provided by AshTestBase and TestSessionControllerClient, but that results in BluetoothPowerController::OnLocalStatePrefServiceInitialized() being called during AshTestBase setup, which writes values into the prefs, which causes the \"default pref value\" checks in some of the tests to fail. So I elected to leave this class mostly as-is and add a new regression test.",
