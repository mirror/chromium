Off the top of my head:\n\n- The traffic, of course, includes the user\u0027s IP address.\n- The hostname that triggered the request is, of course, included. That may be something the user typed into the URL bar.\n- The handshake uses TLS session caching, so previous handshakes may be related to this one.\n- If the server requests a client certificate and either the user selects one [or admin policy auto-selects it], or we had previously remembered a user-selected client certificate for this host, we\u0027ll send it. Client certificates may contain user data. \n- If the server requests a Channel ID (a funny authentication cookie with more crypto attached, managed with the same UI as any other cookie) and the request is made in a credentialed context, we\u0027ll generate and use with it at handshake time. I do not know whether you consider this user data. The Channel ID itself is random, but it\u0027s a correlator, like session caching or other cookies.\n\nNote this is not the only case where a socket\u0027s Connect() triggers lower-level reads or writes. Proxies, for instance. Or DNS.",
