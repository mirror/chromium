      "message": "BTW, it\u0027s a bit of a code smell to have the same CrosSettings set by device policy *and* by other code - my expectation would be that on every subsequent boot, the policy code would reset the CrosSetting.\n\nNot a *huge* issue here (in theory, the subsequent boot would force a device policy fetch, which *should* download a policy with kDeviceEnrollmentIdNeeded \u003d false) but you will get at least one extra EID upload (and the behavior is weird enough that it deserves some documentation).",
