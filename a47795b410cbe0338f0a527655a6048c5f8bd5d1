      "message": "Actually, it will affect everything downstream from the grit output, which is:\nadm/adml/admx (including google/chromeos variants)\nandroid_policy\nreg\ndoc\njson\nplist\nplist_strings\n\nI think this should be fine, becuase we\u0027re fixing one encoding mismatch in the chain, while leaving the rest as it is.\n\nThe chain is:\npolicy_templates.json(1)  (2)\u003e-grit-\u003e(3)  translated policy_templates.json(4)  (5)\u003e-template_fromatter.py-\u003e(6)  various outputs \n\nThe numbers are supposed to mean encoding.\nIt\u0027s important that ((1) \u003d\u003d (2)) and ((3) \u003d\u003d (4) \u003d\u003d (5)). (6) varies for the various outputs.\n\n(1) was utf-8 in the repo but (2) was cp1252 by default. We\u0027re making (2)\u003dutf-8 to fix this.\n(3) and thus (4) is utf-16, it\u0027s set in the else clause of the encoding handling in grit\u0027s build.py: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/tools/grit/grit/tool/build.py?rcl\u003d739fd18dea26b116c03b484145a4163903448b8c\u0026l\u003d381\n(5) is utf-16 which matches (4) so this is fine. See https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/policy/tools/template_writers/template_formatter.py?rcl\u003dc86130404ec109d1bd06422e3db5cde09e1820ad\u0026l\u003d171\n(6) is per output writer, see https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/policy/tools/template_writers/template_formatter.py?rcl\u003dc86130404ec109d1bd06422e3db5cde09e1820ad\u0026l\u003d48\n\nMade this clear in the commit description.",
