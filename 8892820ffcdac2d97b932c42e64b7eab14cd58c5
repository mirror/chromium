      "message": "This is the problem, instead of doing eventSequence +\u003d \u0027ontrack;\u0027 on the event firing, we resolve a promise and do eventSequence +\u003d \u0027ontrack;\u0027 on that promise resolving. This adds an additional delay that, apparently, with two \"independent\" promise chains, had an indeterminate resolution order only visibly wrong on one bot.\n\nChanging ontrack to { eventSequence +\u003d \u0027ontrack;\u0027 ontrackResolver.resolve(); } should do the trick.",
