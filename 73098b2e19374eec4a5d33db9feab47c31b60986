      "message": "I get why you\u0027re calling this \"NoOpAgent\" but the naming still feels a bit odd to me. Both since it\u0027s not technically no-op (still runs callbacks etc) but also looks a bit counter-intuitive in the inheritance tree that you want to inherit from  a \"NoOpAgent\" to get some default behaviors.\n\nHow about \"BaseAgent\" or \"DefaultAgent\" or something instead, since this is something we want all tracing agents to inherit.",
