VAD is per-content, not per-tab object. I think it needs to happen not as a part of reparenting task but of content switching task for the current tab, which can happen repeatedly in the reparented state.\n\nOh you are right. \"Tab reparenting\", ie ContentViewCore.updateWindowAndroid, only updates the WindowAndroid, it does not change the container view. Looks like only webview calls ContentViewCore.setContainerView, but it correctly keeps the one in CVC and the one returned by ViewAndroidDelegate in sync, so no issues here.\n\nBut I think my point still stands that if something else caches the container view, then it needs to listen to the setContainerView event to know to update that reference.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I\u0027m still trying to figure out the consequence of having a new VAD in place of current one work for a WebContents when in VrShell.

VR doesn\u0027t call setContainerView, so the container view doesn\u0027t change for VR. ViewAndroidDelegate doesn\u0027t change either.
