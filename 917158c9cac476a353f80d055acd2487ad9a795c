      "message": "So, this is in a place that\u0027s misleading. We don\u0027t pass the kUsePassthroughCmdDecoder switch to the GPU process any more, but this code is in gpu/command_buffer/service which is code that we expect to run in the GPU process. If someone tries to call this in the GPU process, it will get the wrong result.\n\nI would just move the logic to content::GetGpuPreferencesFromCommandLine and GLManager explicitly.",

      "message": "The flag is still fowarded to the gpu process here: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/gpu/gpu_process_host.cc?l\u003d169 and is used in the gpu process in gpu/ipc/service/gpu_init.cc.  I wanted one centralized place for checking the flag so I can change the defaults easily but I\u0027ll likely need to change it to a --use-cmd-decoder\u003dpassthrough and --use-cmd-decoder\u003dvalidating so that both testing paths are maintained regardless of the default.",
