      "message": "This looks reasonable to me, thanks.\n\nTo guarantee that we are not getting too permissive here, I think we should call |LocalFrame::CreateUserGesture| only when |reason| \u003d\u003d \"mounted\", right?  It seems to me that |reason| \u003d\u003d \"unmounted\" is clearly not a user activation; and |reason| \u003d\u003d \"navigation\" is questionable because a JS-triggered page navigation can possibly invoke |OnActivate|, right?",

Forgot about the other reasons as we currently don\u0027t use them ever :P\n\nWe definitely don\u0027t want a gesture on reason \u003d\u003d NAVIGATION, and probably not unmounted as that\u0027s probably an indication of no longer wanting to interact with the page.",
