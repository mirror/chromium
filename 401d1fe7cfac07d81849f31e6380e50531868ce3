      "message": "This won\u0027t scale, since we have 10 variations of RunExtensionTest() above, and I\u0027d really prefer to not add another 10 here for RunExtensionTestFromExtensionsData().\n\nI think the right-est solution is to move towards having a params struct with some flags, rather than having these different variations, but that\u0027s a pretty big refactor that we don\u0027t have to do here.  In the meantime, though, maybe a simple toggle would be better?  Something like UseRootExtensionsDir()?  Then the change is to just call that method before calling RunExtensionTest(), and the rest automagically works, without needing to eventually add RunComponent, RunIncognito, et al variations.",

      "message": "Hmm, would you rather add an entry to the Flags enum? That looks like the \"scalable\" way - these other 10 methods seem to be largely convenience methods. Or would you prefer to see that enum converted into the struct you\u0027re talking about?",
