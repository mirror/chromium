      "message": "Various translations, e.g. paint offset translation and scroll offset translation, are common when mapping a chunk rect to the containing composited layer. It\u0027s not very important for chunk incremental invalidation for clip change, but it might be good for other cases (I\u0027m not sure though). Perhaps we can limit preservation of tightness for 2d translation only.",
