This will give focus locally and send the click to the remote machine with the same user action. In that case, the data on the remote clipboard is likely to be stale.",

      "message": "Ah I see. This was a note from the privacy team, but I think this goes against the grain of what the permissions team was trying to avoid by removing the gesture requirement. Specifically, see the discussion and arguments in https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/d/msgid/chrome-permissions-team/CAEYdGOViAEBTJHoqqsbf4PzHJEauRuobmaS5F_dYt%3DNhnMHQGg%40mail.gmail.com?utm_medium\u003demail\u0026utm_source\u003dfooter\n\nThe worry was that it\u0027s unintuitive to tie whether or not clipboard write can happen in a particular context to whether clipboard read is granted. I feel like if we were going to do this, it wouldn\u0027t really be better than going back to the user gesture requirement.\n\nIs this something where we can try starting with the simple model and seeing if it turns out to be problematic in practice?",
