      "message": "With remote access, if we wait until focus, then there\u0027s a much larger risk of a race condition if the user attempts to use the clipboard data immediately.\n\nE.g, if they click on a remote paste button. This will give focus locally and send the click to the remote machine with the same user action. In that case, the data on the remote clipboard is likely to be stale.",
