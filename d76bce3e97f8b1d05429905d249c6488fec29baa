      "message": "You need to check property block here too:\n\n  if (weakSelf.propertiesBlock)\n    weakSelf.propertiesBlock(task, error);\n\nI would recommend however to use a local variable to avoid any risk of race-condition between threads (weakSelf may become nil between the check and the call):\n\n  PropertiesBlock propertiesBlock \u003d weakSelf.propertiesBlock;\n  if (propertiesBlock)\n    propertiesBlock(task, error);\n\nNote, that the compiler claims that \"dereferencing a __weak pointer is not allowed due to possible null value caused by race condition, assign it to strong variable first\" when using code like \"weakSelf-\u003e_propertiesBlock\".\n\nSo if there is race condition when dereferencing the pointer, there is race condition between checking the value returned by the property and using it.",
