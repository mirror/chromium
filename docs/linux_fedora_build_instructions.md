# Building Chromium on Fedora

Generally speaking, follow the [Linux Build Instructions](linux_build_instructions.md).
However, do the following instead to install the build dependenies:

Generally, follow the main [Linux Build instructions], but instead of
running `build/install-build-deps.sh`, run:

```shell
su -c 'yum install git python bzip2 tar pkgconfig atk-devel alsa-lib-devel \
bison binutils brlapi-devel bluez-libs-devel bzip2-devel cairo-devel \
cups-devel dbus-devel dbus-glib-devel expat-devel fontconfig-devel \
freetype-devel gcc-c++ GConf2-devel glib2-devel glibc.i686 gperf \
glib2-devel gtk2-devel gtk3-devel java-1.*.0-openjdk-devel libatomic \
libcap-devel libffi-devel libgcc.i686 libgnome-keyring-devel libjpeg-devel \
libstdc++.i686 libX11-devel libXScrnSaver-devel libXtst-devel \
libxkbcommon-x11-devel ncurses-compat-libs nspr-devel nss-devel pam-devel \
pango-devel pciutils-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel zlib.i686 httpd mod_ssl \
php php-cli python-psutil wdiff'
```

The `msttcorefonts` packages can be obtained by following [these
instructions](http://www.fedorafaq.org/#installfonts). For the optional
packages:

* `php-cgi` is provided by the `php-cli` package.
* `sun-java6-fonts` doesn't exist in Fedora repositories, needs investigating.
