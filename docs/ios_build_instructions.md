### Build Instructions (iOS)

**Note:** Upstreaming of iOS code is still a work in progress. In particular, 
note that **it is not currently possible to build an actual Chromium app.**
Currently, the buildable binaries are ios\_web\_shell (a minimal wrapper around
the web layer), and various unit tests.

Prerequisites
-------------

-   A Mac with a version of OS X capable of running the latest version
    of Xcode.
-   The latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/),
    including the current iOS SDK.
-   The current version of the JDK (required for the closure compiler).
-   [depot\_tools](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools).

Setting Up
----------

In the directory where you are going to check out the code, create a
`chromium.gyp_env` to set the build to use iOS targets (and to use
hybrid builds; see Building below):

`echo "{ 'GYP_DEFINES': 'OS=ios','GYP_GENERATORS':
'ninja,xcode-ninja', }" > chromium.gyp_env`

If you aren't set up to sign iOS build products via a developer account,
you should instead use:

`echo "{ 'GYP_DEFINES': 'OS=ios chromium_ios_signing=0', 'GYP_GENERATORS': 'ninja,xcode-ninja', }" > chromium.gyp_env`

Also, you should [install API
keys](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys).

Getting the Code
----------------

Next, [check out the
code](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code), with

`fetch ios`

Building
--------

Build the target you are interested in. The instructions above select
the ninja/Xcode hybrid mode, which uses ninja to do the actual build,
but provides a wrapper Xcode project that can be used to build targets
and navigate the source. (The Xcode project just shells out to ninja to
do the builds, so you can't actually inspect/change target-level
settings from within Xcode; this mode avoids generating a large tree of
Xcode projects, which leads to performance issues in Xcode). To build
with ninja (simulator and device, respectively):

`ninja -C out/Debug-iphonesimulator All`

`ninja -C out/Debug-iphoneos All`

To build with Xcode, open build/all.ninja.xcworkspace, and choose the
target you want to build.

You should always be able to build all:All, since targets are added
there for iOS only when they compile.

Running
-------

Any target that is built and runs on the bots (see below) should run
successfully in a local build. As of the time of writing, this is only
ios\_web\_shell and unit test targetsâ€”see the note at the top of this
page. Check the bots periodically for updates; more targets (new
components) will come on line over time.

To run in the simulator from the command line, you can use `iossim`. For
example, to run a debug build of web\_shell:

`out/Debug-iphonesimulator/iossim out/Debug-iphonesimulator/ios_web_shell.app`

**Converting an existing Mac checkout into an iOS checkout**

If you want to convert your Mac checkout into an iOS checkout, you can
follow the next steps:

1- Add 'target\_os = [ "ios" ]' to the bottom of your chromium/.gclient
file.

2- Make sure you have the following in your chromium/chromium.gyp\_env
file (removing the `chromium_ios_signing=0` if you want to make
developer-signed builds):

{

"GYP\_DEFINES" : "OS=ios chromium\_ios\_signing=0",

"GYP\_GENERATORS" : "ninja,xcode-ninja",

}

\

Then make sure you sync again to get all the new files like the
following. At the end it will run gyp\_chromium which will regenerate
all the build files according to the new settings.

\

`gclient sync`

\

Troubleshooting
---------------

If your build fails, check the iOS columns of [the Mac
waterfall](http://build.chromium.org/p/chromium.mac/console) (the last
two) to see if the bots are green. In general they should be, since
failures on those bots will close the tree.
