I\u0027m not sure it even makes sense to have these non-tail cases anymore. It\u0027s sort of confusing to the reader why were testing these things.\n\nI think a better test now would be to have the same text as the tail suggest case (\"star\") but with a non-tail type so the reader can compare what happens in the two cases with the same input. Thoughts?",
