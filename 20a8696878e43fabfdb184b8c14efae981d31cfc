      "message": "I\u0027m a bit concerned about this, since this doesn\u0027t feel like the right API to be using.\n\nOn one hand, we might be able to expose an API that returns the current RFH given a proxy routing ID and its process ID, making it clear to callers that it will be in a different process.\n\nOn the other hand, there\u0027s some questions about whether this conversion should be happening internally to content/ without requiring this processing of the map.\n\nCan you explain a bit more how the data gets here, so we can see if there are better alternatives?",
