      "message": "\"type {Type}\" looks \"wrong\", as if someone had forgotten the @. I\u0027m also not sure how useful this is; in my experience, type annotations that aren\u0027t statically checked will become erroneous over time (or start that way).\n\nIs there work being done to replace cr.defineProperty itself?",
