      "message": "The trouble stems from this function where we need any old instance to have closed all its file handles. What if instead the net library exposed a function with a completion callback to destroy any files on disk, that function would have to figure it out internally how to close handles prior to deleting files.\n\nint DestroyCacheBackend(...,path, completion_callback);\n\nSo nothing about task runners needs to be provided or exposed. The destroy function is what we\u0027re tyring to compose at this level, let\u0027s just make the disk_cache lib provide that function entirely. Wdyt?",
