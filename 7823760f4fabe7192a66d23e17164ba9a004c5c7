      "message": "Does it make sense to use int64 origin_offset_us directly here?\n\nNested structs have an extra cost, every usage of Time with nested structs would be:\n\n8-byte pointer to Time struct\nTime struct: 8-byte struct header + 8-byte pointer to TimeDelta\nTimeDelta struct: 8-byte struct header + int64\n\nThat is 40 bytes and two layers of indirection. Using int64 will be 24 bytes and one layer of indirection.\n\nWDYT?",
