      "message": "presubmit now bans base::Callback, in favor of more specific Once or Repeating. I don\u0027t fully understand the difference between the two flavors. I did try to use OnceCallback, but got the error \"call to deleted constructor\". The documentation says that base::Callback is aliased to RepeatingCallback, so I used RepeatingCallback here.\nI was also concerned about the lifetime of the bound parameters (url, source_page_url), but I found that the copy constructors are invoked, so we can trust they will be around when the callback is run.",
