I would sooner just get rid of the two-param function, then callsites either wrap the args with ModelError() or you make ModelError a struct (which it should be anyway) and callsites look like\n\n  ...-\u003eReportError({FROM_HERE, message});\n\nAlso, doesn\u0027t this \"convenience\" method totally defeat the purpose of Location? I thought FROM_HERE only works when it\u0027s inlined (hence \"HERE\").",

This makes the patch larger and is generally equivalent to the previous version, with the upside that ModelError might be extended in the future.",
