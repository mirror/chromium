I would sooner just get rid of the two-param function, then callsites either wrap the args with ModelError() or you make ModelError a struct (which it should be anyway) and callsites look like\n\n  ...-\u003eReportError({FROM_HERE, message});\n\nAlso, doesn\u0027t this \"convenience\" method totally defeat the purpose of Location? I thought FROM_HERE only works when it\u0027s inlined (hence \"HERE\").",
