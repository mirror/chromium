Did you change anything here, or were there other CLs landed in the meantime that make the CL work this time?\n\nIn case you did change something, a great way to make this obvious to reviewers is to upload the verbatim reverted CL as PatchSet 1 and then add a PatchSet 2 with the changes on top.",

Good suggestion for uploading two PatchSets to easily see the changes between the original CL and the reland CL. Will abandon this CL and create a new one.",

      "message": "I appreciate this environment going to a class and pair of files for itself, which is already much closer to being reusable than having it buried in a *.cc file.\n\nNow the next step would be to move these files to a location that matches how general the provided functionality really is (this functionality is completely unspecific to media/capture/video). I have seen almost identical duplicates of this class in a few other places I believe (usually buried inside a *.cc file). If all these duplicates had been created at a canonical reusable place instead, they would be both reusable and discoverable and we would decrease the risk of ending up with duplicates.\n\nCould you do me a favor and see if you find any duplicates and merge them into one?",
