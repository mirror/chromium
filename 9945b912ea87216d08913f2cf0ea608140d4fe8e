      "message": "I would guess that other full page plugins would find this behaviour undesirable, but yeah, maybe we should play it safe and only disable for pdf. I should be able to query for the extension here and check its ID.\n\nAs discussed offline, I can create a bug to investigate having the viewer actually handle the event, following servicification of the pdf viewer (it looks like crbug.com/702993 is the bug I can block on).",
