# But for ia2_api_all.tlb, the offset is 0xc8 instead.
# ...looks like the number at 0x20 is some count that's smaller for ia2.
# (0x1d == 29 vs 0x23 == 35. 0xe0 - 0xc8 == 24, 35 - 29 is 6, which neatly
# divides the 24 bytes. So the number at 0x20 is number of 4 byte somethings.
# 0xe0 - 35*4 == 0xc8 - 29*4 == 84, so the ints probably start at 84/0x54?)
# This theory mostly works out, except some offsets are 0xffff (== not present,
# always have len of 0).
# This suggests the fixed file header is 84/0x54 bytes long.

# I changed header contents (xxd, change, xxd -r) and opened the modified tlb
# files in oleview.exe to discover the meaning of some of these fields.
