      "message": "I was thinking of something like this (but it\u0027s slightly more involved to get right), but in thinking about this more I think the issue is WebView. That WebView automatically changes focus behavior conflicts too much with how clients (like BrowserView) want to use it. How about adding this to Webview:\n\n// If true the FocusBehavior of WebView changes depending upon whether\n// WebView has content. If false WebView never internally changes the\n// focus behavior.\nvoid set_adjust_focus_behavior(bool adjust_focus_behavior);\n\nDefault is true, but BrowserView would set it to false.",
