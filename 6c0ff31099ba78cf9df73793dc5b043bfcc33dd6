I was reading about the split window (again):\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/core/v8/WindowProxy.h?rcl\u003dbf700714f1c3918dfd6d68b4b143e34f6cbc1a83\u0026l\u003d59\n\nLooking at that, it seems it might be more correct to have the conditional bindings on the actual global instance (inner global)?
