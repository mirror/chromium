(so VEA would still work)\n\nHappy to change it the other way to pull in the dependency if that\u0027s better though.",

      "message": "I am not sure familiar with this code either. But I think you are right: when the mojo path failed it\u0027ll fallback to the old non-mojo one.\n\nFWIW, \"enable_mojo_media\" was intended for media playback, but recently we added some non-playback mojo clients/services to media/mojo/services, causing some confusions about dependency rules. I\u0027ll see what I can do to clean it up. For now, ISTM pulling in the dependency unconditionally should be the right fix.",
