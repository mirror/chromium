      "message": "So I think this does exactly the same as ShrinkToFit() (except the DCHECK).\n\nIn both cases you have a max_size and a min_size, that you want to clamp |size| to. If |size| is within the range of [min_size, max_size], simply return |size|. Otherwise return the constrain value that |size| \"violated\".\n\nIn either case you\u0027ll end up returning the median value. Since you should be able to assume that min_size \u003c\u003d max_size (so that the \"array\" of 3 items is already partially sorted), finding the median can be done easily with two comparisons. (Otherwise, you\u0027d need more.)",

      "message": "Why do you say that I can assume min \u003c\u003d max? That\u0027s definitely not true for the min/max-width case:\n\n  min-width: 50px;\n  max-width: 10px;\n^ perfectly valid. And if you use keywords for one of those, it may even make sense.\n\nI think you may be right that for min/max-content computations that may be true, though I\u0027m not 100% certain.",

      "message": "Oh! Yeah, that\u0027s what I was talking about min/max-content sizes. I failed to realize that you were dealing with the {min,max}-{width,height} CSS properties. Sorry!\n\nFor min/max-content sizes, on the other hand, order shouldn\u0027t matter, and I really think that MinMaxSize::ShrinkToFit() *could* be implemented by calling your new MinMaxSize::ClampSizeToMinAndMax() (and at the same time keep the DCHECK).\n\nBut I guess it makes sense to keep them separate. Then we implement shrink-to-fit in the same order as in the CSS2 spec.",
