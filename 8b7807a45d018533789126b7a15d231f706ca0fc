      "message": "So I think this does exactly the same as ShrinkToFit() (except the DCHECK).\n\nIn both cases you have a max_size and a min_size, that you want to clamp |size| to. If |size| is within the range of [min_size, max_size], simply return |size|. Otherwise return the constrain value that |size| \"violated\".\n\nIn either case you\u0027ll end up returning the median value. Since you should be able to assume that min_size \u003c\u003d max_size (so that the \"array\" of 3 items is already partially sorted), finding the median can be done easily with two comparisons. (Otherwise, you\u0027d need more.)",
