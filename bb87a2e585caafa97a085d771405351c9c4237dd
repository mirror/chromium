      "message": "The PaintRecord is not fully self-contained regarding property tree states.\n\nFor example, if the transform tree is like\n Root\n   Transform1\n     Transform2\n, and the filtered element starts before Transform2, and the filter is a reference filter, painting of the filter will contain a chunk whose transform state is Transform2. When replaying the repainting to a record, Transform2 need to map to the state of SVGFilterRecordingContext. Previously we mapped to the root state which resulted extra transform (Transform1) created in the record.",
