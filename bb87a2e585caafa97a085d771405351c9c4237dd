      "message": "The PaintRecord is not fully self-contained regarding property tree states.\n\nFor example, if the transform tree is like\n Root\n   Transform1\n     Transform2\n, and the filtered element starts before Transform2, and the filter is a reference filter, painting of the filter will contain a chunk whose transform state is Transform2. When replaying the repainting to a record, Transform2 need to map to the state of SVGFilterRecordingContext. Previously we mapped to the root state which resulted extra transform (Transform1) created in the record.",

We just paint them directly without paint property nodes.\n\nFor non-svg effects above the filtered element, this CL makes it correct by not applying the effects in the filter record.
