Just want to make sure we\u0027re not creating a race here.\n\nSomething like [A1, *A2].  We try to go back to A1 (same document), but the page has committed B (cross-document) by then.  So we hop up here to convert it to a cross-document load, but in the meantime we\u0027ve gone back from B to A2, so that A1 is now same document again.  Is that ruled out in some way?",
