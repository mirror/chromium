Was there an independent decision that manual fallbacks should include not-secure warnings? If so, that\u0027s fine with me, but note that it looks like their presence will be gated on the Form-Not-Secure Finch trial which is currently disabled. If you want a not-secure warning in the manual fallbacks dropdown, you\u0027ll probably need to set up a separate Finch trial for it.",
