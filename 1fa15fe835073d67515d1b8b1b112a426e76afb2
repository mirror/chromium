      "message": "Why should this be data_deps? My thinking is that all the stuff that\u0027s going to be in the far needs to be completely built by the point at which we generate the manifest file, otherwise the isdir() test could fail, right? But if it\u0027s data_deps, then all we know is that it\u0027ll be built sometime during the build, but not necessarily before this step. (I think?)",

      "message": "data_deps is needed for runtime deps file generation, which is an essential input for manifest generation. It\u0027s used in addition to \"deps\" which establishes the target build precedence.\n\nI used a print statement to verify that \"deps\" is being set properly. It points the executable() target, which seems correct. (e.g. [\":content_unittests__exec\"])",

      "message": "Surprising that we need |data_deps| as well as |write_runtime_deps| - or is the issue that without copying |pkg.deps| into |data_deps|, the package\u0027s deps aren\u0027t regarded as runtime dependencies?\n\nI\u0027m still a little confused by this; don\u0027t we want to know the runtime_deps of the things on what we depend, rather than the write_manifest_target step\u0027s run-time dependencies?  e.g. write_manifest_target depends on inputs including the _runtime_deps_file, but presumably we don\u0027t expect that file to be listed inside itself? :)",
