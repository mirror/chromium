What I interpret as going on in this function is that the HttpCacheTransaction is telling the cache/the entry that it\u0027s done with it, but what the means is dependent on whether it\u0027s within writers.  In the abstract I sorta feel like if HC::T is in writers, it should be calling something on writers to say its done rather than calling the cache directly, but I can also see the argument that the entry is our intermediary in talking to the writers object.  But in that case, let\u0027s indirect at this point in to the writers object rather than making several calls into methods on writers and then calling a cache method that is implicitly called by HC::W?",

I could imagine that that might make us subject to races where a new transaction is added to writers between this point and the completion of the truncated response write, but if that\u0027s the case, I\u0027m confused as to why we\u0027re not subject to the same races elsewhere in the state machine?",

But if this is just going to turn into a conditional at every call site (even if there\u0027s just one call site) I\u0027m not in favor--I\u0027m bringing it up more in case we\u0027ll be calling it with/without exclusive from different locations.",
