      "message": "ro.country is a Chromecast thing, so it doesn\u0027t make sense to read it here.\n\nThere are multiple properties on Android that could be used to set the factory locale. Here\u0027s the logic: http://cs/android/frameworks/base/core/jni/AndroidRuntime.cpp?l\u003d444 It seems like at minimum you\u0027d need to check ro.product.locale and ro.product.locale.region, but I\u0027m not sure we should attempt to duplicate all or part of that logic.\n\nI would say to just use \"ro.boot.wificountrycode\", but the annoying part is that this value is used as locale in some places and wifi country code in others, with the apparent assumption that they\u0027re always the same even though on Android they may not be (though practically they probably are). Not sure what is best here, we should discuss tomorrow.",
