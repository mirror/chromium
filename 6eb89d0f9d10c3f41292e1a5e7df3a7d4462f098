I guess it\u0027s not very trusted (but that\u0027s because I just reviewed the PPAPI version today).\n\n(I tried to figure this out from grepping the manifest.json files, but that\u0027s hard for media, because there\u0027s a single uber-interface that binds everything else that bypasses the normal service manifests? At least I couldn\u0027t find any mention of ContentDecryptionModule in the manifests?)",
