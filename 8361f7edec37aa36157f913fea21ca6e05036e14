I know it\u0027s a simple case.\n\nJust to talk out loud, I wondered whether perhaps we should just add this check instead to the StyleWillChange callsite which I would guess is this one:\n\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/layout/LayoutBoxModelObject.cpp?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d282\n\nSince it looks like this should never be the case for the other callsites (famous last words).
