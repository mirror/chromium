      "message": "Does the ResourceClient/ResourceOwner merging CL affect the behavior?\nIt looks like preserving Resource lifetime regarding to CSSPreloaderResourceClient but I might be missing something.\n\nAlternatively can we make the reference from |css_preloaders_| weak, i.e.\nHeapHashMap\u003cWeakMember\u003cResource\u003e, Member\u003cCSSPreloaderResourceClient\u003e\u003e?\n(I\u0027m not so sure this works / which is better though)\n\nIIUC in the current patch set, strong reference(s) to Resource from around HTMLResourcePreloader are:\n1. Until the first DataReceived():\n  Always kept via CSSPreloaderResourceClient.\n2. Until end():\n  (Previously) Kept only for unused preloads via CSSPreloaderResourceClient.\n  (After this CL w/o Line 936) Always kept via |preloader_|.\n  (After this CL w/ Line 936) Always kept via |preloader_|.\n3. After end() until HTMLDocumentParser is garbage-collected:\n  (Previously) Kept only for unused preloads via CSSPreloaderResourceClient.\n  (After this CL w/o Line 936) Always kept via |preloader_|.\n  (After this CL w/ Line 936) No longer kept.\n4. After HTMLDocumentParser is garbage-collected:\n  No longer kept.\n\nCalling preloader_.Clear() has an additional (perhaps good?) side effect of clearing the Resource references for unused preloads a little earlier (i.e. in end() instead of HTMLDocumentParser\u0027s destruction).\n\n+kouhei@ (parsing expert) +csharrison@ (CSSPreloadScanner expert), do you have any opinion about the lifetime here?",
