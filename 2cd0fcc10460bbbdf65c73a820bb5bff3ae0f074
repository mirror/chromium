I guess it\u0027s not your responsibility to add one, so yes you are fixing a bug, while creating another one. I\u0027ll look for a replacement OWNER, or maybe we should just remove set noparent here.\n\n\u003eIf you don\u0027t trust the owners of src/chrome/browser/resources, src/chrome/browser, src/chrome, or src/, that\u0027s another problem.\n\nI don\u0027t think this was implied anywhere in my response.
