      "message": "This is making the search engines list, startup URLs list and passwords list (among others) non selectable. Are we sure that we want this? Those lists contains URLs and other content that users might want to copy/paste elsewhere.\n\nFor example in the passwords list the user has an option to reveal a password, but now they can\u0027t copy/paste, which sounds like an important use case.\n\nCan we narrow down this fix to only affect the \"add language dialog\" for now? And possibly get further advice from UX for other places where we used iron-lists?",

      "message": "Discussed this offline in MD settings stand-up. I believe the consensus is that this is a flaw in iron-list that selection doesn\u0027t work properly. Ideally selection in iron-list would work correctly and no workaround would be necessary. It\u0027s a workaround for a bug, rather than a UX choice. \n\nThere are some cases where we can reasonably risk having user selection on a list.\n\nIn the next patch, I move this change into settings_shared_css.html and add an override named |risk-selection| to set chosen iron-lists to allow selection. risk-selection has been added to search engines, startup urls, and passwords lists.",
