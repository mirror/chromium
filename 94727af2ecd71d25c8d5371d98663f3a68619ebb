      "message": "I\u0027m refactoring/deduplicating/renaming those methods, classes and variables that clash in a jumbo configuration I have locally. That configuration is much more aggressive than the default settings, with all of chrome/browser in a single translation unit (that takes 4 minutes to compile). That is to catch problems bound to happen, not just the ones that buildbot would find today.\n\nSo variables that have generic names but just happen to be alone will be safe, but on the other hand, if the code has managed 10 years with only one with that name, maybe it will manage 10 years more. It seems to be copy+paste that is a bigger problem than generic variable names.\n\nIn general there is a problem with sharing code in the code base, especially between sibling code. I have no good idea for this but I think it\u0027s harming the code base.\n\nOk, end side track, back to main track:\n\nWe have people looking at making a clang supported version of jumbo. I don\u0027t know how likely that is to succeed, but if it does, then many of the collisions will no longer be collisions (some will though). There is also the question of jumbo in CQ. It was meant to happen before Christmas but resource problems have delayed it and I don\u0027t know for how long. It\u0027s not something I can affect. Barring those two, there will be breakage every now and then and it will have to be manually fixed. Usually, depending on the time zone, when it happens, someone will notice and fix within a few hours which is better than nothing.",

Even if it\u0027s a small fraction of all code it\u0027s still hundreds of places all over the code base.\n\nI try to comfort myself with: \n\n* It\u0027s just a very small number of global symbols that are affected over all. Probably  \u003c0.1% (and no local variables or member variables). There were 20-35 rename patches in content/browser which has 43,000 public exported symbols.\n\n* One day someone might save a lot of time thanks to a symbol in a stack trace having a unique name so that there is no confusion. Maybe.\n\n* A lot of code is just habit. We (I) dislike change more than what the change leads to so I think the impact over time will be small. Maybe a bad thought towards me once per month when seeing a line break that might not have been needed otherwise. :-(\n\nBut the impact is really huge. Or rather, normal C++ compilation is really terribly inefficient. When I test compile right now I compile all of chrome/browser:browser in one file and the compiler needs about 250 CPU seconds for it. When compiling normally, one file at a time, the compiler needs 5,700 CPU seconds (1.6 CPU hours), \u003e20 times more. From that I get that 95% of the job compiling Chromium is repeated work. Header parsing, and (probably the big culprit) template processing.\n\nSince we want quick single-file editing and good use of parallel hardware nobody is going to have everything in a single file (brucedawson tuned jumbo for goma and ended up with max 8 cc files per jumbo unit, rather than up to 1000).\n\n(I\u0027d ask you to give it a go, but v8 broke the jumbo build an hour ago and it will take several hours for the fix to come to chromium master)",
