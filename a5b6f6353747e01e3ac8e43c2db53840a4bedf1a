      "message": "It seems like we bounce between const char* and std::string several times... it\u0027d be nice if we didn\u0027t need to do these conversions\n\nIt\u0027s unclear to me if this code is safe: Platform::GetInterfaceProvider() returns a blink::InterfaceProvider*. content::BlinkInterfaceProviderImpl posts a task to the main thread if called from off the main thread--and passes onwards the const char*. I\u0027m not sure how |name| is guaranteed to stay live in that case.\n\nI tried to prove/disprove this locally, but I appear to be hitting a check--do I need to be running the layout tests in this CL with a special flag?",
