But you want the \"real\" scale here, not the \"virtual\" scale.\n\nWell, I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t see this ever fitting into this whole \"display/window android/view android tree\" structure. So anything we do is going to feel like a hack, in which case we should just make the hack explicit. We could just add another scale to display to be used the here. Trickiest thing is giving it a meaningful name that doesn\u0027t confuse anyone reading it for the first time...",
