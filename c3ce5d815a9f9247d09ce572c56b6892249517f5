      "message": "there\u0027s a whole bunch of other logic in loadAlreadyLocked. why is it correct to ignore all that, and just pull this bit out? I mean if Linker.isUsed returns true, this code never executes\n\nAlso now this is called before receiving command lines from browser, so should name the method that way (fooWithoutCommandline or something like), and audit all the methods that this calls that none of them use command line either, then rename them as well.",

      "message": "Previously preloader was called if (!mLoaded \u0026\u0026 !Linker.isUsed()) was true. Now it\u0027s called if (!Linker.isUsed() \u0026\u0026 !sLibraryPreloaderCalled) is true. The only difference is that now it\u0027s called at most once, while previously it could be called multiple times, if library loading was retried after an exception. But I don\u0027t think Chrome ever retries library loading on failure. So while there is a difference, I don\u0027t think it matters.\n\nI can rename a method, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary. By definition NativeLibraryPreloader. loadLibrary(Context) only depends on Context, so it can\u0027t possibly care about Chrome-specific stuff, like command line.",

Occasionally we change this java code and introduce a bug, and only realize later with the problem. So I\u0027m hoping we don\u0027t make that mistake again, and actually pay the cost of maintenance upfront.",

      "message": "I agree, it looks strange. I\u0027ve replaced that call with a handler.\n\nActually, we could just call preload() from bind() directly. But I thought it\u0027ll be good to avoid increasing bind() runtime without a good reason.\n\nThe speedup is only for warmed up renderers, and comes from the fact that chunk of loading work happens in bind() (i.e. before navigation), and not during navigation. This affects a case where Chrome reloads last tab (or navigates to a URL) on startup. Other usecase where renderer is started during navigation is not affected - see the bug for graphs.",
