      "message": "Looking at the implementation of base/time.h I think you\u0027re right and I could use base::Time() instead of base::Time::Min(), since base::Time() wraps a zero-timestamp, it should be comparable to and less than any real timestamps. However, given I had to look at the implementation to determine that, this seems more correct ? I don\u0027t feel strongly though, and your way is a bit neater..",
