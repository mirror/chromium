      "message": "A bit of a design suggestion. Can we make set_paint_image_generator return *this like the rest of the setters. Can we also not create a cached_sk_image_ here? The intent of this api is to create a PaintImage. If required, we can add a PaintImage::uniqueImageId() or simply PaintImage-\u003eGetSkImage()-\u003euniqueID() for this, which would naturally create the cached shader.",
