Waiting on this event enables us to ensure that the previous profiling occurring on the profiler thread has stopped before either starting profiling afresh from the same profiler, or destroying the profiler. We can\u0027t use task posting for this coordination because the thread owning the profiler may not have a message loop.\n\nIn this case we are not restarting the profiling, so there\u0027s guaranteed to be 0 wait here. In the restart case (which is not currently in use) the typical wait is 0 and the max wait is the time for the profiler to take one sample, which is a a couple hundred microseconds -- see the comment in the destructor.",

Reading the code one can easily verify that the event starts signalled, and the only waits on the event are in Start() and the destructor.
