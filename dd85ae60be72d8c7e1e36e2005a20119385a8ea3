      "message": "The purpose of this histogram is to track if it is safe to remove GetCurrentURL method and replace with GetLastCommittedURL. The name was always incorrect, because CurrentURLEqualsLastCommittedURL was never about equality check. I would prefer to keep the current histogram because the purpose of this histogram has not changed and because what we actually want to track with this histogram is when it gets to 100%. WDYT?",

      "message": "I do still think you should rename the histogram, so that there is a clean break between differences in semantics.  You can just append a \"2\" to the name to rename it, though I think CurrentOriginEqualsLastCommittedOrigin would be even clearer.\n\nThat said, given that this is a fairly narrowly targeted histogram that\u0027s likely only viewed by a very small group of developers, I won\u0027t insist.  I would suggest at least adding a small reminder line, along the lines of \"Note: Prior to M63, this measured whether URLs were equal, rather than comparing origins.\"",
