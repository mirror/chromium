      "message": "Why not use base::Optional for ssl_info and fatal? Alternatively, wrap the values in a unique_ptr that is null when not needed.\n\nThe call site in NavigationRequest::OnStartChecksComplete is not cross-thread, as NavigationRequest is a UI thread object. In fact, all calls to NavigationURLloaderDelegate are made from the UI thread. The cross-thread calls in the chain of calls happen in NavigationURLLoaderImplCore: that class whole purpose is to make cross-thread calls.",
