In the future, I anticipate that we will rename the channel (to \"Google Feed\"; our suggestions aren\u0027t currently quite the same thing, but we\u0027re working on it). I had assumed that we could use this mechanism for a name change, but if not, then I\u0027ll switch to a boolean and we\u0027ll plan for a new channel then.",
