In the future, I anticipate that we will rename the channel (to \"Google Feed\"; our suggestions aren\u0027t currently quite the same thing, but we\u0027re working on it). I had assumed that we could use this mechanism for a name change, but if not, then I\u0027ll switch to a boolean and we\u0027ll plan for a new channel then.",

Sorry for any confusion. \n\n..But if you decide you don\u0027t need to be able to rename the channel then I agree storing a bool like you have in PS6 is sensible, (rather than recreating them every time, at least while we are using reflection, since it is slow).",
