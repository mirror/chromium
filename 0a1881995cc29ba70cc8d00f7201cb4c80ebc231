      "message": "I\u0027m binding the process id manually, so I don\u0027t see how invoking the callback will be possible with a wrong process id. I could verify that it has been called, which is what I want to make sure, but then I have to signal somehow the test case itself that the waitable condition is satisfied. Instead of creating yet another way of signalling that, I prefer to do it the way that is as close to what happens in reality - process is terminated.",
