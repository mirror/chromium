      "message": "There\u0027s a few issues with this:\n1- when we clear the backbuffer (e.g. in DoClear), nothing currently will go and update the clear rect in that image, and so we may force a clear when using the texture for read\n2- since this is not attached to a Framebuffer that would be current, nothing will do a lazy clear in GLES2DecoderImpl::CheckFramebufferValid\n\nThey both could be solved with a fair bit of code in GLES2DecoderImpl::CheckFramebufferValid, but maybe simpler would be to force |zero| to true if |is_cleared| is false.",
