      "message": "Reading this CL, I think having both \"Detach\" and \"Dispose\" is a bit confusing. Not sure if we want to call it something more specific, like DetachFromLayout, etc.\n\nMaybe we should have Document::Shutdown() just call detach/dispose directly so we don\u0027t need this block here? Or maybe this code should just be part of Dispose(), and Detach() can just flip the bool? WDYT?",
