I think it should have been:\n\n} else if (PreferenceAPI::Get(profile)-\u003eDoesExtensionControlPref(\n                       extension-\u003eid(), browser_pref, \u0026from_incognito) \u0026\u0026\n           from_incognito) {\n  ...\n}\n\nNote the ! on the DoesExtensionControlPref value.  Right now, this says \"if the extension does *not* control the pref, restrict it to the normal profile\", which isn\u0027t correct.\n\nLooks like this happened between patch set 4 and 5, as a result of trying to remove the !incognito check but missing the deletion of the unary operator:\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/882508/4..5/chrome/browser/extensions/api/preference/preference_helpers.cc\n\nToni, can you confirm that this was accidental?  If so, I\u0027ll see if I can fix it and tweak our tests (they should have caught this, but were racy.)",
