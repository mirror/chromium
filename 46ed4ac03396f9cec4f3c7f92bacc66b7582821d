      "message": "Yup, I know about WARN_UNUSED_RESULT, but these headers cannot include base dependenciesâ€”since they get pulled into all sorts of other projects, I have to keep them dependency-free.\n\nAnd I wouldn\u0027t worry about the the MSVC thing, since we don\u0027t actually build Chrome with PreFast, and we\u0027re migrating Chrome to Windows with m62. I just did it to support third-parties that are using PreFast.",
