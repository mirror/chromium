On Windows debug builds that triggered a debug check that the count (in this case the total number of elements in a multi-dimensional array) is less than or equal to the number of elements in that one-dimensional array which is never true.\n\nThis new line results in the std::generate_n to receive a pointer and cannot thus trigger that (in this case) erroneous array boundary check.",
