Not sure it adds THAT much value, but should probably add one here as well.  If it DHCECKs from the message loop issue, we can just add it DISABLED with a TODO to reenable.",

I think that |-performSelector:| should be used when the calling code doesn\u0027t know which selectors to call (e.g. if a superclass is dispatching a selector supplied by a subclass).  Since the selectors are chosen by this code, I think it\u0027s better to avoid |-performSelector:| and instead directly call the selectors in the dispatcher\u0027s protocols:\n\nif (self.usesTabStrip)\n  [self.dispatcher showTabStrip];\nelse\n  [self.dispatcher showTabGrid];",
