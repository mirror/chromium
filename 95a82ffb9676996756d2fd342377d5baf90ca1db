This might be more of a theoretical concern, but I guess it would be nice if there was some kind of obvious guarantee that it wasn\u0027t a concern at all?\n\nI think re-structuring the code by wrapping the state machine switch in |Transition| in a` for(;state_ !\u003d IDLE;) { }` might make this a bit easier (the for-condition is probably a little more complicated than that)?  Then the handling methods could simply return into |Transition|, rather than having to recurse to it. That would perhaps make it easier to centralize things like the timeout and retries a little better? Just an idea, I haven\u0027t fully thought this through.",

Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but this would cause device transaction to hang without callback whenever U2fHIDDevice::Transition() is called after setting |state_| to IDLE, which occurs after successful channel allocation.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach might be adding a static variable that represents counter for channel allocation retries?",
