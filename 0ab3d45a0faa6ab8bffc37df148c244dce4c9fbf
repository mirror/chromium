      "message": "I didn\u0027t initially use base::Clock/Time since I didn\u0027t know about it. :) Actually the epoch for DefaultClock is the windows epoch, so it\u0027s less complicated than your example.\n\nI assume you were both looking at using base::Time rather than time() but also to abstract the clock by using a base::Clock* rather than a function pointer.\n\nI\u0027ve made the former change for now. Note that the calculation is a little more obtuse due to https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d634507 . Which means that we\u0027d still need an additional helper wrapper function for both the consumer and the test. Plus the clock needs to be set/unset via ScopedProcHandler. It also needs to be destroyed which means the scoped handler needs to either delete it or have a unique_ptr, which then makes constructor/destructor into a \"complex\" one, meaning it has to move to the .cc. And then the simple nested class mechanism for inline replacement is more complicated.\n\nIt seems like extra complexity with no real gain especially since it\u0027s a private part of the implementation anyway unless you feel strongly about it.",

      "message": "I was specifically suggesting to avoid using base::Time::Now() in favor of passing in a base::Clock, yes.\n\nHowever, I was also writing it to avoid any assumptions (about the zero point or ToInternalValue). I\u0027m not sure why you suggested there would need to be an additional helper function, ScopedProcHelper, etc. Could you expand on the concerns?\n\nThat is, I thought it would be easier, not more difficult. I\u0027m also not sure I understand your concerns re: scoped_ptr - that doesn\u0027t seem to raise complexity at all?\n\n(Re-reading) Is the issue because you\u0027re using static globals to override/inject the test behaviour (line 145 - 147), rather than being something that can be passed to the factory? For these heremetic tests, aren\u0027t they something we can test via the factory (e.g. dependency injection)? Just trying to make sure I understand the concern properly, even though it looks like \"fix the static\" may be a CL in its own right :)",

      "message": "I agree that this is a little vague in the spec. However I don\u0027t really see this spec as a good faith effort to clearly communicate :) It\u0027s full of ambiguities, it\u0027s clearly reverse engineered from the code, and bits and pieces of it have been updated without relevant dependent information also being updated. Note that before MIC and EPA (which came after the original NTLMv2) the target info was never modified and was repeated verbatim back to the server (it has to be unless the server intends to maintain state between messages).\n\nPage 45 implies that they are copied and added to. Note the wording that says (paraphrased) \"If there is a flags AV_PAIR, then *set* the MIC bit, else *add* an AV_PAIR structure\".\n\nPage 44 - Note that CHALLENGE_MESSAGE.TargetInfo is used as the \"ServerName\" input to ComputeResponse which calculates the NTLM response on the client. This is ambiguous in a different way because it implies it is used verbatim from the challenge message (which used to be true), when in fact it should be the \"updated target info\". I suspect this part of the spec just wasn\u0027t updated.\n\nPage 52 - The server calculates the expected response with ComputeResponse using \u0027ServerName\u0027 which is defined on Page 57 as \"NtChallengeResponseFields.NTLMv2_RESPONSE.NTLMv2_CLIENT_CHALLENGE.AvPairs field\nstructure of the AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE payload.\". \n\nBecause the client uses the challenge target info in that calculation it has to send it to the server (it has to send the same or updated target info that went into the response) otherwise the server can\u0027t calculate the same response value.\n\nAs a practical matter - I suspect that you could actually arbitrarily modify the target info payloads (with the exception of the fields that contain the channel bindings and spn) as long as you send to the server whatever mutated version you used as the input to ComputeResponse. In fact look at appendix b item #30 - it pretty much says \"some versions of windows append some extra bytes whose content is unspecified\" aka buffer overflow.\n\nI\u0027d further guess that most likely servers that don\u0027t know about EPA/MIC (ie win 2k3 and earlier) you could probably use completely random data as the target info since there\u0027s no reason for the server to even try and parse it.",

      "message": "My interpretation is that it\u0027s up to the client if it wants to send the MIC (but it SHOULD), and that the presence of the timestamp is just an indirect indicator as to whether the server will actually validate it. Note in the appendix item #16 (which versions send a timestamp) vs #46, #53, and #65 (which versions support MIC) are the same.\n\nPage 29 says the timestamp is always sent in the challenge message (except per #16 because older versions don\u0027t support it).\n\nPage 53 says \"If the AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE indicates the presence of a MIC field,\u003c65\u003e then the MIC value computed earlier MUST be compared to MessageMIC\". \n\nSo basically servers always send the timestamp (unless they are too old), and they always must validate the MIC if it is sent by the client (unless they are too old to know they should - in which case it will be ignored and since all the security buffers will point after it, they won\u0027t even know that it is there).\n\nSo I think the right thing is to always send it. New/compliant servers will always try to validate it, old/non-compliant servers will just ignore it. And there\u0027s no possibility that it could be downgraded.\n\nIt is worth noting though - that (in regular HTTP case) the client has no way to determine whether the server validated the MIC or just never checked it (except by the assumption that it was a Windows server, and all versions of windows that sent a timestamp check the MIC).\n\nThere seems to be no notion of refusing to interact with a server that doesn\u0027t send a timestamp (ie. implicitly won\u0027t check the MIC) - at least not in the current version.",
