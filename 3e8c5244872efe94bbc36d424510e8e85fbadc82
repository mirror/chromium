      "message": "I changed this to SkColorSetA(COLOR_BOOKMARK_TEXT, 0x20) because it works better for themes that don\u0027t have a toolbar background color specified and instead just use an image. (Virginia Beach, again, is one of these.) For themes that use COLOR_TOOLBAR instead of an image, it should make no difference. At that point, it became the same implementation as COLOR_DETACHED_BOOKMARK_BAR_SEPARATOR so it just calls through to that. SG?",
