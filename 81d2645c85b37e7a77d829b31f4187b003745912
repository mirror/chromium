      "message": "This does feel slightly odd but I guess NSS is so obscenely global that it works? You could imagine making ImportClientCertAndKeyFromFile and ImportClientCertToSlot return ScopedCERTCertificates, but I\u0027m guessing that ends up being a pain?\n\nMostly my thinking is if we could avoid x509_util::FindCERTCertificateFromX509Certificate existing as a function people would find convenient to use, maybe there\u0027ll be less dependency on the globals around. But I haven\u0027t seen the rest of this CL, so you may have already thought about this and concluded it\u0027s not worth the trouble.\n\nThoughts?",
