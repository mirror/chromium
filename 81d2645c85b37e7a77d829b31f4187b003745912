      "message": "This does feel slightly odd but I guess NSS is so obscenely global that it works? You could imagine making ImportClientCertAndKeyFromFile and ImportClientCertToSlot return ScopedCERTCertificates, but I\u0027m guessing that ends up being a pain?\n\nMostly my thinking is if we could avoid x509_util::FindCERTCertificateFromX509Certificate existing as a function people would find convenient to use, maybe there\u0027ll be less dependency on the globals around. But I haven\u0027t seen the rest of this CL, so you may have already thought about this and concluded it\u0027s not worth the trouble.\n\nThoughts?",

      "message": "Yeah, this was mostly just being lazy since there are a bunch of places that use the ImportClientCertAndKeyFromFile and ImportClientCertToSlot functions.. but I think I came up with a reasonable way to handle it that doesn\u0027t require updating all the call sites at once.\n\nI\u0027ve also removed the FindCERTCertificateFOO functions from this CL, though they\u0027ll show up again in one of the later ones, you can judge what you think of those uses once we get there :)",
