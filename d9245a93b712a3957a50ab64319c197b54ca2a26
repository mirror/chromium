      "message": "Question: should we calculate |needs_blur| first? ie.\n\nbool needs_blur \u003d locked \u0026\u0026 IsBlurEnabled();\nif (needs_blur ^ is_wallpaper_blurred_) {\n...\n}\n\nIn addition, I think having both |IsBlurEnabled()| and |ShouldApplyBlur()| at the same time is a little confusing. Maybe we can remove |ShouldApplyBlur()|, and inline it in |InstallDesktopController| (since that\u0027s the only place it\u0027s used.)\n\nSo in that way, IsBlurEnabled() only indicates if blur is permitted at all, but it\u0027s up to the specific function to decide if they want to apply blur. What do you think?",

      "message": "Ok. I will to this.\n\nInitially I wanted to put all checks into ShouldApplyBlur(). I would need to store information about locking state somewhere. The code is a little bit spread out (animations can be started by SessionManager or by PowerButtonController), unlocking info is stored in SessionManager, LockStateController is already sending animation related events to LockStateObservers. All of this is order sensitive, so I decided not to touch it now, because it needs to be merge into 64.",
