      "message": "What is the APK size increase with including this?  That is my main concern.  components/vector_icons is 168K and components/omnibox/browser/vector_icons/ is 52K.  I suspect that compresses nicely and wouldn\u0027t be nearly that size, but build a release APK before and after and see what the size difference is.\n\nI do wonder long term if Android ships vector versions of these assets as well, should we find a path to converging to avoid duplication, but that is a tangential discussion IMO.",

      "message": "Ted, where did you obtain those numbers OOC?\n\nThis CL pulls in 6 new vector icons.  Using supersize, I get this delta for the complete CL (code + icons):\n\nMonochromePublic.apk_Breakdown (+8,192 bytes)\n        +3 bytes Zip Overhead\n    +8,192 bytes Native code size\n        -3 bytes Package metadata size\nMonochromePublic.apk_Specifics\n    +8,192 bytes normalized apk size\n    +8,192 bytes main lib size\n\n... with this more detailed snippet of the actual resource sizes:\n\nMonochromePublic.apk_MainLibInfo (+5,516 bytes)\n235       +280 bytes unwind\n236     +2,672 bytes text\n237       +288 bytes relocations\n238         +0 bytes bss\n239         +4 bytes symbols\n240         +0 bytes other\n241     +2,272 bytes data\n\nTo isolate the icon-specific impact, I added a local commit that backs out only the icons, and get this decrease:\n\nMonochromePublic.apk_MainLibInfo (-2,376 bytes)\n        +0 bytes unwind\n        -4 bytes text\n      -192 bytes relocations\n        +0 bytes bss\n        -4 bytes symbols\n        +0 bytes other\n    -2,176 bytes data\n\nSo I think we\u0027re talking a little over 2K impact, which feels right.
