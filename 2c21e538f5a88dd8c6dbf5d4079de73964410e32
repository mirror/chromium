      "message": "What is the APK size increase with including this?  That is my main concern.  components/vector_icons is 168K and components/omnibox/browser/vector_icons/ is 52K.  I suspect that compresses nicely and wouldn\u0027t be nearly that size, but build a release APK before and after and see what the size difference is.\n\nI do wonder long term if Android ships vector versions of these assets as well, should we find a path to converging to avoid duplication, but that is a tangential discussion IMO.",
