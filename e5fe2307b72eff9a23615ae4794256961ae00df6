      "message": "I really don\u0027t like this myself either. Actually if I remove this whole block that usecase you mentioned (e.g. pausing the debugger and tap on continue button) works just fine. Reason being that all these use cases only use the gesture event path (in particular gesture tab) and they don\u0027t need the touch events. Is that alright if I remove handling of this altogether?",

      "message": "Hmm... Interesting. Does the inspect mode work with touchscreen? You can try that with Ctrl+Shit+C in DevTools, and then touching on the page should reveal the element in DevTools.\n\nIf that works, I guess we can remove the handling.\nAlso note, that we do not really care about the primary pointer - any would work for us I guess.",

      "message": "Good. That is a usecase that I wasn\u0027t aware of. That technically can use the webtouchevents and not gestures. However, it is already broken without this change. Before this change when I move my mouse over the page it automatically highlights the devtool code in Ctrl+Shift+C mode. But for touch it only works for touchstart and doesn\u0027t work with touch moves anymore.\nAnyhow, if that is the only usecase I believe we can live with that even without this primary pointer hack. What do you think? So basically we run the logic for any touch point.",
