I think it\u0027d be fine to just drop GetFillColor and simply check that the pixel is the same color after decoding the second frame.\n\n(If you really wanted to keep this check, you could make things simpler by using an alpha of ff. Then the premultiplied and unpremultiplied colors would match.)",

      "message": "I agree with what you\u0027re saying.\nI think attempting to verify we have a color which is different from the allocator default color isn\u0027t terribly helpful. We are already intimately familiar with the image internals. I think it is fair to also know the color (and thus know it isn\u0027t the same as the allocator\u0027s color).",
