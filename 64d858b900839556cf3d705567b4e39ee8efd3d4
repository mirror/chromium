      "message": "Although wheel-scroll-factor was apparently added for the sake of a Blackberry device implementing touchpad scrolling (http://crbug.com/483231), that was in the context of them generating mousewheel events at the OS level, apparently with their own outside-app fling gesture curve, much like OS X works.  It\u0027s not clear what that value has to do with this alternate mechanism of supporting touchpad scroll.  Did you check that it has exactly the same velocity as touchpad scrolling inside system Android Views (e.g. settings page)?",

      "message": "I didn\u0027t check the scroll velocity at all, this CL was a quick proof-of-concept before I went out on vacation.  Unless we have a way to inject a device specific factor here, we can either go for a stop-gap solution like this now only to fix the P1 bug, or can keep firing these events as touch to preserve the old behavior (see http://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/619175).  Which one would you prefer?\n\nIn the meantime, I will check if the scroll velocity here seems acceptable.",

      "message": "If we\u0027re going to commit to supporting this, this patch is better since it\u0027s not much more complicated and actually behaves properly with JS wheel handlers etc.  That said, please fix it to get the correct velocity, since the value \"64 * deviceScaleFactor\" (the default size of a mousewheel tick) doesn\u0027t have anything to do with this.",
