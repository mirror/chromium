(Perhaps there is a good\nreason, partly trying to understand NG better.)\n\nAlso, I think it makes more sense to update this inside of PaintInvalidator::InvalidatePaint,\nafter visual rect update. In addition to matching the implementation pattern of the tree\nwalk, it should be able to take advantage of dirty bit avoidance for whether the visual\nrect needs updating.\n\nIs there a reason why you needed things from children? InlineBox,\nInlineTextBox, etc don\u0027t have their own VisualRects in non-NG mode anyway.",
