I will approve this CL because I understand this use case is important for you and I\u0027m thinking long term, once we\u0027ve implemented snav2* , we will get rid of the extra complexity of skip lists.\n\n* http://bit.ly/snav2 tackles this bug, I hope, by focusing iframes before going in/out from them.\n\nWhy do we need skiplists? (I\u0027m gonna answer this question myself to make sure I understood this).\nInstead of adding a skiplist, say we make IsNavigableContainer return false also when iframes can\u0027t scroll. That won\u0027t work because snav would then ignore non-scrollable iframes\u0027 focusables \u003d\u003e We must run FindFocusCandidateInContainer on the iframe and if it finds nothing, then we need to go back and look for another focus candidate but *skip* the iframes that we know had nothing...",
