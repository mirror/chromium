      "message": "\u003e Can we just get rid of both casts instead?   They\u0027re both Categories.\n\nNo, doesn’t work. When there’s a Category in there, the logging DCHECK stuff wants to emit code to compare and print Category values: CheckLTImpl, MakeCheckOpString, and MakeCheckOpValueString. These wind up as exported symbols. That’s what causes the problem: we don’t want junk exported symbols like these, and it trips up the verification.\n\n\u003e Also, are enums really unsigned by default on OSX non-component builds? \n\u003e Or is something else going on here?\n\nThe problem occurs at the link stage, not the compile stage.",
