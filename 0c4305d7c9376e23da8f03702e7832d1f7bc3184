The view bounds are the same after scrolling in such cases.\n\n\u003e So in addition to applying the pageScaleFactor you also have to apply the visual viewport offset, see VisualViewport::RootFrame for how that\u0027s done in Blink. The offset is exposed via WebView::VisualViewportOffset\n\nCurrently the only user of this method seems to be gpu_benchmarking_extension.cc and I could not find the exact value on the browser side. I think setting PSF \u003d 1 should be enough since we are not testing pinch-zooming and the idea is to verify that with ScrollFocused... the box is in the view now.\n\nThat being said having a more generic test which considers non-unity PSF would be nicer. I am not sure though how I can reliably determine if a given frame is visible on the page.\nadding kenrb@ for suggestions. I am also wondering about the usage of PSF in some other tests such as ViewBoundsInNestedFrameTest which (appears to me) is doing something similar.",
