But I manually re-wrote this patch and submitted it in my another machine. That is why it became GL_RED not GL_RGB. Sorry for my carelessness.",

If this is the correct fix then internal_format should be passed to GLImage::CopyTexImage so that it can verify that the internal_format is supported, rather than having this code know details about the macOS implementation of that method. Could you please restructure it?",
