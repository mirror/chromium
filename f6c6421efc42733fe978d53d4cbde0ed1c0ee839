      "message": "the reasoning behind is that not all platforms (i.e. different Gen) will not support all codecs and/or VAVDA, VAVEA and VAJDA; also ChromeOS imposes some restrictions on its own in this sense.  It could be the case that someone might think that a given codec is not working, although this patch is not modifying any of that.",

      "message": "What I had in mind for this was slightly simpler:\n\n1) Move the body of PostSandboxInitialization() at the end of PreSandboxInitialization()\n2) Delete PostSandBoxInitialization() and the call to it in VADisplayState().\n\nAlthough this requires testing, I believe this would work just as before. PreSandboxInitialization() is called only once, which will mimic the static qualifier we used to call PostSandboxInitialization(), and we will have all the sandboxing-related code in one single function.",
