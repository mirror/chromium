      "message": "This API is deprecated and we should not change it. But the bigger problem is making changes in CRWWebController. We don\u0027t have *any* tests to verify that changes do not bring regressions. I do see a bug (probably a crash) with this CL because CloseWebState() call may happen on web state which is being destructed. But there is also a chance of introducing other bugs because certain code will now execute asynchronously. shouldAllowLoadWithNavigationAction: is in pretty bad shape and I don\u0027t think we can reason well about the implication of these changes.\n\nIt would be fine to accept the risky patch if the purpose of a change is a bug fix. But it does not look like this change fixes any bugs. What will happen if we do not land this CL?",
