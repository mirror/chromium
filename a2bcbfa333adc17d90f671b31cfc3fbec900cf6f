      "message": "The thing I\u0027m worried about here is removing a !safe_for_autoreplace URL.  That would be a true-manual-addition type thing and I kinda wouldn\u0027t want to blow that away.  Maybe in that case it\u0027s OK not to touch this or update its timestamp, and have it get filtered out, because the user has explicitly looked at this engine in the search engine edit dialog before, and if they wanted it as default, they could have done so then?\n\nI suspect this would be rare; most !prepopulated entries would still be safe_for_autoreplace due to auto-addition on visits.",

      "message": "For this case, we need all of these search engines to be added.  If removing it ever isn\u0027t ok, then we\u0027re in a bad way.  We\u0027d either way to ensure they\u0027re visible by updating the timestamp, or it will crash as we are in an unsupported situation.\n\nAs this is very much a special case, removing it and adding it back is \"OK\".  The other option would be to clear all search engines and force them to be shown for a different locale as if you started fresh.  If this is unlikely, then it is just and edge case of this needing to be supported.",

      "message": "This conditional seems incorrect.\n\nFirst, the DCHECK can never fail, because we\u0027re inside a conditional for (added_turl).  Second, I don\u0027t think you meant to return false if we succeeded in adding the URL.  And it doesn\u0027t make sense to handle DCHECK failure anyway (per our style guide).\n\nSo I think probably leaving the old code as is was is more what you want?",
