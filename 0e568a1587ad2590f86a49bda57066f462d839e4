      "message": "The downside of using the context from the Frame\u0027s current document is that this test is now invalid, since the script context we invalidated isn\u0027t the main document\u0027s script context anymore.  Do you have a suggestion of how to update it to test the \"context is invalid at the time of call\"-scenario?",

      "message": "Most of the APIs on WebLocalFrameImpl have to do with the document in the frame at the time of the call. I think my instinct would be to rely on callers that are targeting a particular ScriptContext/v8::Context to check if it\u0027s still valid (i.e. not unloaded) at that time. This is something I\u0027d reasonably expect them to know anyway.\n\ne.g. in the extension use case, you\u0027re probably getting at the WebLocalFrame via ScriptContext, which has |is_valid()|.\n\nYes, I think that makes this particular test case less useful.",
