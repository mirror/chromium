As result no default apps are available after CHILD user logins ChromeOS first time. We want let CHILD user subset of apps (listed in bug) available for unmanaged user. So this folder just contains json declarations of extensions need to be installed by default.",

      "message": "No, we don\u0027t duplicate files. Unmanaged users include subset for child users. Single file is out of current design how we load the default apps. List of default apps are provided by ExternalProviderInterface with the implementation in ExternalProviderImpl. ExternalProviderImpl works by parsing directories for json files. We have multiple instances for ExternalProviderImpl that is executed over different folders. Adding single file with list of apps means adding new type of provider which looks like a duplicate work.\n\nFor child user we run ExternalProviderImpl over child_users\nFor unmanaged user we run ExternalProviderImpl over child_users and over unamanaged_users folder.\nNote there is already existing code that for for managed user run ExternalProviderImpl over managed_users folder.\n\nSo I just extend this idea and added concept of child_users folder.",
