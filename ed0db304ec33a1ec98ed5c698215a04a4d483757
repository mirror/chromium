      "message": "What is the flow here when ShowPromo() is called when a promo is already visible?  (Or if the add/edit bookmark widget is already visible) Perhaps a quick return is appropriate.\n\nSimilarly, what is the flow when the user triggers the StarButton (trying to show the add/edit bookmark widget) when a promo bubble is visible?  I would expect one of three things:\n1 - the promo widget is dismissed and replaced with the add/edit widget\n2 - the promo widget is simply dismissed\n3 - the add/edit widget is not shown and the user action is a no-op (not a huge fan but at least it\u0027s deterministic.\n\n(It might be valuable to add a test to answer that later question and ensure it remains true depending on how convoluted the solution is)",
