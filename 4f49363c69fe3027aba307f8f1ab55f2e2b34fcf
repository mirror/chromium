At first glance, it\u0027s not clear why these definitions matter and what the implications of changing them are.",

      "message": "I\u0027m finding this confusing to reverse engineer, since it\u0027s very close to TestBackwardsCompat but some of the names are reversed (encoded vs decoded) or used in a different way, and it\u0027s largely reordered.\n\n1) Can you clarify what this is testing, perhaps with a comment?  Will future unit tests need to add things like this, the way they currently add to the list above?  (If not, can we put some kind of a \"Add tests for future versions here\" comment in the right place?)\n\n2) If the naming/reordering is a code improvement in general (e.g., I don\u0027t immediately see why we called line 224 \"encoded\" when it\u0027s coming out of Base64Decode), then maybe we should clean up the code in both places to make them easier to compare?",
