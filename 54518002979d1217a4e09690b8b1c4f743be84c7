      "message": "Note that this test case is a failure because it\u0027s \"more secure\": the expectation is to not taint but we taint. It\u0027s because the src URL is cross-origin, and the service worker ends up returning a response from the original origin. I\u0027m not sure I agree with the expectation (which came from the taint tests for image) and think it\u0027s not problematic to taint here.",
