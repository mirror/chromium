      "message": "Probably ui::AX_EVENT_TEXT_CHANGED is slightly better semantically,\nbut both will work exactly the same in the current codebase so it\ndoesn\u0027t matter too much.\n\nI can\u0027t see an easy way to do this in views::View, because\nmost Views classes don\u0027t store accessibility properties, they\njust retrieve them on demand.\n\nI am working on a large-scale design change so that event firing\nwill be almost completely implicit. This line could be replaced\nwith something more like MarkAccessibilityDirty().\n\nThe master bug for that is: http://crbug.com/699438, I\u0027m focusing\non Blink first since that\u0027s the bigger change, but doing the same\nfor Views will be an easy side effort to that.",
