      "message": "Could you please double-check with affiliation API owners that this is how they intended we use their API?  It\u0027s not clear to me whether we should get the branding info from the affiliated Web site, or the Android app itself.\n\nIf the latter is indeed how the API should be used, I\u0027d argue that there is nothing \"affiliated\" about |name| and |icon_url| in that case, it\u0027s just `branding info`, so we should reflect that in the naming of things. In this case we should also update comments around AffiliationService::GetAffiliations and its implementation, and add tests to ensure that it actually returns the queried facet.",
