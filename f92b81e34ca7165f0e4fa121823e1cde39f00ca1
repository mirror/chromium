      "message": "I renamed FramesDropped to VideoFramesDropped.\n\nTRACE_EVENT1 is a macro that expands into multiple statements, so {} is necessary.\n\nIn current (non-TBMv2) benchmark we report dropped frame count as an integer, and increases to it is a regression. For this we don\u0027t need VideoFramesDecoded. An alternative would be reporting frames dropped as a percentage of frames decoded. Please let me know if you think that would be more useful.",
