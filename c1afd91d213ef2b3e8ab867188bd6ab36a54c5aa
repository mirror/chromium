I *suspect* you only want the first write to be followed by a ping, but maybe not? \n\nIn QUIC, we have a similar metric. We use either the last read time, or, the time of the first write time after the last read time. In other words, we only allow a single write to move this metric, but subsequent once don\u0027t. But I have no idea if this what you want here :\u003e",

      "message": "Hm, I think the logic is slightly different here.  After a long pause, the first write will be prefaced by a PING.  However, the next write will not: if the ACK has not been received yet, then |pings_in_flight| is true, so SendPrefacePingIfNoneInFlight() does an early return.  When the ACK is received, DoReadComplete updates |last_read_time_|, so this condition does not hold, therefore there is no more preface PINGs.\n\nIf enough time passes after getting that ACK, then indeed I want yet another PING to be sent.",
