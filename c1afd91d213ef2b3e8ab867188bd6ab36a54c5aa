I *suspect* you only want the first write to be followed by a ping, but maybe not? \n\nIn QUIC, we have a similar metric. We use either the last read time, or, the time of the first write time after the last read time. In other words, we only allow a single write to move this metric, but subsequent once don\u0027t. But I have no idea if this what you want here :\u003e",
