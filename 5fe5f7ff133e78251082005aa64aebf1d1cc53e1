      "message": "EndingSelection().IsDirectional() will always be equal to frame.Selection.IsDirectonal() as\nDeleteKeyPressed(granularity,..) is called from DeleteKeyPressed(Document\u0026..) or TypingCommand::DoApply().\n1) If it is called from DeleteKeyPressed(granularity,..), then always the EndingSelection is upated with the current frameSelection when the typing is open, else a new typingCommand is created which will also take value from frameSelection.\n2) If it called from the TypingCommand::DoApply, then it comes directly from the EditorCommand which will also have frameSelection directional.\nSo i think the value passed will always be the frameSelection directional.\n\nThe extra parameter is added to avoid inclusion of FrameSelection.h in SelectionModifier.\n\nSimilar is also the case with the ForwardDeleteKeyPressed below",
