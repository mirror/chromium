I wonder if we should actually either save a reference to the owner document in the constructor or cache it\u0027s secure context status.",

As far as I can tell, the Worklet logic for IsSecureContext is the same as for ServiceWorkers, which I thought would be sufficient.\n\nHowever, I think caching the secure context for the document is a good idea, and should address my concerns in my other comment.",
