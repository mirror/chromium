      "message": "What\u0027s missing are the different max buffer sizes per platform, and the fact that we only want to increase the final Web Audio buffer size by multiples of the chosen hardware buffer size and not the minimum. On OSX for example if someone requests a buffer size of 5000 frames we would have:\n\nbuffer_size \u003d [5000/128]*128 \u003d 5120\noutput_buffer_size \u003d clamp(5120) between 128 and 4096 \u003d 4096\nrounded_buffer_size \u003d [5000/4096]*4096 \u003d 8192\n\nThe thought here being that we know the hardware can run at 4096 so it doesn\u0027t make sense for Web Audio to run at 5120, but 8192 would make sense. For values below the max though you\u0027re right that this calculation is redundant.\n\nMaybe the code could be simplified by shortcutting the calculations if requested_buffer_size is \u003e kMaxAudioBufferSize. Do you want me to try to refactor this a bit? Or does any of this not make sense?",

Thanks!\n\n\u003e And why it has to be a multiplier of minimum buffer size?\n\nI tried to include this in the comment too but on the platforms where the minimum is lower than the hardware_buffer_size (OSX and ChromeOS) we know that it\u0027s safe to use multiples of this minimum size.\n\n\u003e Why we don\u0027t relate to the actual hardware buffer size instead?\n\nThe hardware_buffer_size comes from the AudioManager and is its \"preferred\" output buffer size, but we want to be able to change this and run the hardware at an even lower buffer size, hence the minimum. We could special-case the minimum and use the hardware_buffer_size in the \"multiples of\" calculation though if you think that\u0027s better, though it should be safe to use multiples of the minimum as well I believe.  \n\n\u003e Could you put rationale for calculations into the comment?\n\nTried to add more detail there, let me know if that looks better!",
