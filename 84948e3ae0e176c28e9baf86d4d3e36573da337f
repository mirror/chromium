      "message": "I think this is probably the main risk for this CL.  A hosted app that creates a popup from a same-site (non-app) iframe won\u0027t be able to script the popup.  That may matter in practice for some sites.\n\nThen again, they would probably break today as well if we put the same-site (non-app) iframe in an OOPIF, so it doesn\u0027t seem like it\u0027s making anything worse for --site-per-process, and does make things better by having fewer OOPIFs and requiring more steps before encountering a bug.  Seems like a good tradeoff to make for now.",
