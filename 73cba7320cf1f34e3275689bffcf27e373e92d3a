Or the SSLPrivateKey is already expected to be used from a thread that allows potentially time-consuming operations?\n\n(I see that this hashing used to happen on the current thread, so my question is whether this could be improved for certificateProvider or isn\u0027t worth it.)",

I put it here since I was doing this change pretty mechanically, but happy to move it into SignDigestOnServiceTaskRunner if you like.\n\nFor the platform SSLPrivateKeys, we put it on a thread because the operation would get serviced by some smartcard, but hashing\u0027s uninteresting.",

      "message": "I see. Note only that \"OnServiceTaskRunner\" will likely be a worse choice, as it\u0027ll basically imply the UI thread.\n\nIt seems that SSLPrivateKey is currently called from an IO thread, so it\u0027s probably not too bad to leave the hashing being performed there.\n\nOffloading the hashing onto a background thread (via the PostTaskWithTraits() API) would be neater, but I won\u0027t insist on this as it\u0027s anyway not a regression from the previous behavior. But feel free to do this either :)",
