Or the SSLPrivateKey is already expected to be used from a thread that allows potentially time-consuming operations?\n\n(I see that this hashing used to happen on the current thread, so my question is whether this could be improved for certificateProvider or isn\u0027t worth it.)",

I put it here since I was doing this change pretty mechanically, but happy to move it into SignDigestOnServiceTaskRunner if you like.\n\nFor the platform SSLPrivateKeys, we put it on a thread because the operation would get serviced by some smartcard, but hashing\u0027s uninteresting.",
