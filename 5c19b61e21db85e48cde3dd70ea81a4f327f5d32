Once an extension disabled due to the blacklist is removed from it, it gets automatically re-enabled back.\n\nIt\u0027s also a bit unfortunate that the behavior here is so much different from the scenario with removing an extension from ExtensionInstallForcelist - the extension actually gets wiped away in that case. But, I guess, this inconsistency should not affect anyone seriously...",
