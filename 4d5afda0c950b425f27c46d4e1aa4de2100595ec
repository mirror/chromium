      "message": "If overriding OnWindowDestroying(aura::Window* window) here, It works fine during manual testing but breaks several unittests. The scenarios in unittests look like:\n- Have at least 2 windows in MRU list\n- Snap 2 windows to left and right of the screen\n- Delete one of the snapped windows |window|. In OnSnappedWindowMinimizedOrDestroyed(window), it will call WindowSelectorController::ToggleOverview() to open the overview\n- When calculating the MRU window lists to decide which windows to be shown in the overview window grid, |window| should not be in the MRU list. However, in the unittests, it still shows in the list.\n\nI did more investigation on this, it seems in test environment, wm::CanActivateWindow(aura::Window* window)  still returns true for a to-be-closed window. It only happens in tests though.\n\nActually here in OnWindowDestroyed(), it calls OnSnappedWindowMinimizedOrDestroyed(window) which doesn\u0027t call any method on the destroyed window so I think it should be fine to override either OnWindowDestroying() or OnWindowDestroyed() here. But if you think it\u0027s better to override OnWindowDestroying(), I\u0027ll try to fix the tests.",
