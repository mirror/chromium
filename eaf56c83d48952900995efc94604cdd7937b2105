      "message": "Sorry, this still bothers me a bit. I think in general we want to carefully code when document_ is available or not, and adding bunch of this condition would make the clarification less clear.  For example in some cases we try to use GetFrame()-\u003eGetDocument() if document_ is not available, but might still want to make sure we do so only for some frame/request types.  Could we add a specialized ctor for !document_ case for FrozenState?",
