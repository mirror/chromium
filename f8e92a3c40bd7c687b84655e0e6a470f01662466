The desktop_capture target is still needed by src/chrome/browser/media/webrtc/native_desktop_media_list.cc, which is also in this target.\nTechnically speaking, DesktopCapturer as well as its implementations are not \"exported\" from content library in component build. Won\u0027t it introduce problems on other platforms?",

As Native_desktop_media_list only uses some webrtc/desktop_capture definitions, it\u0027s fine here.\nThe problem in chrome/ is the destruction of the webrtc::DesktopCaptureOptions when it creates capturer.",
