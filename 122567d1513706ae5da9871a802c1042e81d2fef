Therefore without this functionality, it would not have been correctly applied.\n\nThough I also discovered that changing content settings on that website through OIB in Incognito did not work - likely because there is no pref reading in incognito, just the map in memory.\n\nSeems like we need the canonicalization in HostContentSettingsMap::SetWebsiteSetting* for it to work properly. I suggest leaving this in, and we (Raymes and I) should address this separately.",
