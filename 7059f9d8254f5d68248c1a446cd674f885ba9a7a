      "message": "FixedBufferForTesting is not very useful now. IMO, we should probably replace it with a grow-as-needed buffer which is not backed by message. And then we could use it for serialization testing or the Serialize() public API. It seems unnecessary to rely on a mojo::Message when we just want to do some serialization work.",

      "message": "In this patch I noticed that edk initialization had to be added to two more test main()\u0027s. I think that is related to the fact that we use mojo message as a grow-as-needed buffer?\nBesides, this CL has to change those mojo::internal::FixedBufferForTesting to mojo::Message, it might not be a lot of extra work to change it to mojo::internal::SomeGrowableBufferForTesting instead.\n\nThat being said, if you feel like to leave this as a future refactoring, I am fine with that too.",
