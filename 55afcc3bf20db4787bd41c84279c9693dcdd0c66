      "message": "The DialRegistry tracks both a listener count and an observer list.  It think it would be simpler to just have it track observers (one each for a DialAPI/dial_sink_service instance).  I think the reason for this is that the extension expects to get an event when a new event handler is added to chrome.dial.onDeviceList (crbug.com/576817).\n\nI am not sure it\u0027s worth trying to fix this since hopefully the DIAL API will be turned down shortly but a TODO could be in order.",
