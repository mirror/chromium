      "message": "note ElideHost takes a typesetter since it can used from secondary toolkit-views UI as well as cocoa UI. That\u0027s not necessary for ElideUrl. But of course we could pass in a typesetter arg from StatusBarMac to ElideUrl if we wanted too. (This could help if we want to transition StatusBarMac to use a views::Widget separately from flipping mac_views_browser, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a compelling reason to launch the status bar separately at this stage).",
