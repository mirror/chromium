# The core loading code in this directory is being transitioned into a separate
# Mojo networking service. See http://crbug.com/598073. The first stage is to
# decouple the code that will be moved from the rest of content. These rules
# help ensure that we don't add more includes, and can progressively reduce the
# code's dependencies.
#
# For each file, the first section shows includes that are allowed (i.e. because
# they are for files that will be moving as well). The second section, separated
# by a comment, lists files that we will have to decouple.
