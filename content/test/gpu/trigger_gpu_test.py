"""Custom swarming triggering script.

This script does custom swarming triggering logic, to allow one GPU bot to
conceptually span multiple Swarming configurations, while lumping all trigger
calls under one logical step.

The reason this script is needed is to allow seamless upgrades of the GPU, OS
version, or graphics driver. GPU tests are triggered with precise values for all
of these Swarming dimensions. This ensures that if a machine is added to the
Swarming pool with a slightly different configuration, tests don't fail for
unexpected reasons.

During an upgrade of the fleet, it's not feasible to take half of the machines
offline. We had some experience with this during a recent upgrade of the GPUs in
the main Windows and Linux NVIDIA bots. In the middle of the upgrade, only 50%
of the capacity was available, and CQ jobs started to time out. Once the hurdle
had been passed in the middle of the upgrade, capacity was sufficient, but it's
crucial that this process remain seamless.

This script receives multiple machine configurations on the command line in the
form of quoted strings. These strings are JSON dictionaries that represent
entries in the "dimensions" array of the "swarming" dictionary in the
src/testing/buildbot JSON files. The script queries the Swarming pool for the
number of machines of each configuration, and distributes work (shards) among
them using the following algorithm:

1. If either configuration has machines available (online, not busy at the time
of the query) then distribute shards to them first.

2. Compute the relative fractions of all of the live (online, not quarantined,
not dead) machines of all configurations.

3. Distribute the remaining shards probabilistically among these configurations.

The use of random numbers attempts to avoid the pathology where one
configuration only has a couple of machines, and work is never distributed to it
once all machines are busy.

This script must have roughly the same command line interface as swarming.py
trigger. It modifies it in the following ways:
 * Inserts bot id into swarming trigger dimensions, and swarming task arguments.
 * Intercepts the dump-json argument, and creates its own by combining the
   results from each trigger call.

This script is normally called from the swarming recipe module in tools/build.
