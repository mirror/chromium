/**
 * Manages oom bindings used to bound child services. "Oom binding" is a binding that raises the
 * process oom priority so that it shouldn't be killed by the OS out-of-memory killer under
 * normal conditions (it can still be killed under drastic memory pressure). ChildProcessConnections
 * have two oom bindings: initial binding and strong binding.
 *
 * XXX
 * BindingManager receives calls that signal status of each service (setPriority())
 * and the entire embedding application (onSentToBackground(), onBroughtToForeground()) and
 * manipulates child process bindings accordingly.
 *
 * In particular, BindingManager is responsible for:
 * - adding and removing the strong binding as service visibility changes (foreground)
 * - adding and removing the initial binding (boostForPendingViews)
 * - dropping the current oom bindings when a new connection is started on a low-memory device
 * - keeping a strong binding on the foreground service while the entire application is in
 *   background
 *
 * Thread-safety: most of the methods will be called only on the main thread, exceptions are
 * explicitly noted.
