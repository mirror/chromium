      "message": "2 thoughts here:\n* i believe some of these fields can be legitimately unset due to caching, so we may not want to assert their presence. for example IIUC if the DNS lookup is cached, or the main resource is cached, we may not get timing data.\n* i think we probably want to assert that it\u0027s the main resource of the page in particular that we receive timing for. as implemented this will trigger if any resource on the page provides timing data. we might consider only considering it a valid loaded resource for the purpises of this function if extra_request_complete_info \u003d\u003d RESOURCE_TYPE_MAIN_FRAME",
