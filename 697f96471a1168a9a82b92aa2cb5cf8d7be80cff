It doesn\u0027t necessarily need to mention the flag if we expect it to not be needed long term. And once-per-page seems reasonable to me (though may need some guidance on how to guarantee that in code).",

It arguably helps a tiny bit.\n\nSo in the short term, I think it is OK to continue with this CL and print a message.
