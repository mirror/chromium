      "message": "Did a little code search, and found that there is another usage of RuntimeEnabledFeatures::SetOverlayScrollbarsEnabled() in Source/core/frame/FrameTestHelpers.h.\n\nPlease update UseMockScrollbarSettings class in FrameTestHelpers.h to use ScopedOverlayScrollbarForTest, and use UseMockScrollbarSettings here, so that we can also eliminate the usage of Settings::SetMockScrollbarsEnabled() in this class which doesn\u0027t restore it.\n\nBecause it doesn\u0027t look good to include FrameTestHelpers.h here, please move UseMockScrollbarSettings class into a standalone header, e.g. Source/platform/testing/UseMockScrollbarSettings.h, and include it from FrameTestHelpers.h and from this file. To do that, you also need to change Settings::SetMockScrollbarEnabled() to ScrollbarTheme::SetMockScrollbarEnabled() in the class because Settings is a core/ class which is not accessible from platform/.\n\nIf you would like do more work on this, the next step is to remove Settings::SetMockScrollbarEnabled() (https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/frame/Settings.h?rcl\u003d626ddef09338ab3e0582e0188d0c7633e23178af\u0026l\u003d81) and change all callers to use ScrollbarTheme::SetMockScrollbarEnabled() or UseMockScrollbarSettings.",
