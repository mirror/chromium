      "message": "Isn\u0027t this wrong? If current_progress is how far the animation has already progressed this will make the duration longer if it is near completion. I don\u0027t think you need the if (showing_) condition at all with the current_progress taking into account showing_. Make sure the unit test catches this case.",

      "message": "Not necessary, but another way to test this without duplicating the implementation logic is to just test that it is sub-linear. i.e. this would run show for 0.5, then hide for 0.5 and EXPECT_GT(0, slide_animation_-\u003eGetCurrentValue()) because if it was linear running it for the same time would have returned it to the initial value.",
