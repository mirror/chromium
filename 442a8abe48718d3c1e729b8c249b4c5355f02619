      "message": "Ah that makes sense. Thanks for pointing it out. I added these tests and removed all the reference tests for fills. \n\nHowever I still see an usefulness in keeping them for suggestions, because those cannot be tested directly in JS. I still test by checking the internals.suggestedValue() but it does not test what the user actually sees.\n\nLet me know what you think. If you think the new test is sufficient, I will remove the remaining Reference tests.\n\nThanks!",
