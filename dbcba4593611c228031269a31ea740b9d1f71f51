There\u0027s a scary comment above Image::ToNSImage which says \"The returned result is a weak pointer owned by and scoped to the life of the Image.\". Which in this case is a temporary.\n\nAlso we don\u0027t really need NSImage.\n\nOther places in mac code that deal with vector icons (e.g. LocationBarViewMac::UpdateLocationIcon()) are calling NSImageFromImageSkiaWithColorSpace directly with base::mac::GetSRGBColorSpace()\n\nwe should do that here too. Maybe with a helper function.",
