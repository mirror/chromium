      "message": "Yes, I did - I started off making all of these icons the .x1.icon variants, but was hitting this DCHECK https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/gfx/paint_vector_icon.cc?rcl\u003d7be49f33afa3174281ad1617d5d1ba5dfa423175\u0026l\u003d544 when testing with --force-device-scale-factor\u003d2 on CrOS when opening the other UI surface the same icons were being used in.\n\nThat led me to the bug cited in this TODO (https://crbug.com/647286) which seems to suggest that the idea is to have separate .icon files for differently sized vector icons?\n\nPlease let me know if I\u0027ve misunderstood something - basically what I want is to have the same icon be used at 18x18dip in one UI surface and 16x16 in another, regardless of the device scale factor. Thanks for the help!",

I took a screenshot so you can see as well: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RbbuzxIjBrIM-8VfYE-j7qh_ErT9L9y0/view?usp\u003dsharing (left is using the existing icons, right is after applying this patch).\n\nIn the screenshot, it seems like the location, notification, flash/extension and MIDI icons look fuzzy. The rest look clear but the size is wrong (I assumed due to additional internal padding).",

      "message": "so... although I *think* these are safe due to ref counting. There\u0027s a scary comment above Image::ToNSImage which says \"The returned result is a weak pointer owned by and scoped to the life of the Image.\". Which in this case is a temporary.\n\nAlso we don\u0027t really need NSImage.\n\nOther places in mac code that deal with vector icons (e.g. LocationBarViewMac::UpdateLocationIcon()) are calling NSImageFromImageSkiaWithColorSpace directly with base::mac::GetSRGBColorSpace()\n\nwe should do that here too. Maybe with a helper function.",
