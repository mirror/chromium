      "message": "Yes, I did - I started off making all of these icons the .x1.icon variants, but was hitting this DCHECK https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/gfx/paint_vector_icon.cc?rcl\u003d7be49f33afa3174281ad1617d5d1ba5dfa423175\u0026l\u003d544 when testing with --force-device-scale-factor\u003d2 on CrOS when opening the other UI surface the same icons were being used in.\n\nThat led me to the bug cited in this TODO (https://crbug.com/647286) which seems to suggest that the idea is to have separate .icon files for differently sized vector icons?\n\nPlease let me know if I\u0027ve misunderstood something - basically what I want is to have the same icon be used at 18x18dip in one UI surface and 16x16 in another, regardless of the device scale factor. Thanks for the help!",
