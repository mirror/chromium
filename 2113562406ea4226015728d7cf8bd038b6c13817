      "message": "The diff in this file is challenging to review. I think that we can make it simpler via a two-step process:\n\n1. Do a preparatory CL that changes |get_storage_info_func_| to just be a callback that returns an MtpStorageInfo* from a storage name. In prod, this will be bound to mtp_manager_-\u003eGetStorageInfo(); in the test, it will return an MtpStorageInfo* with the desired values.\n2. In this CL, keep |get_storage_info_func_| and just change the test function as you\u0027re changing the prod function, i.e., taking in a callback that it runs with the MtpStorageInfo*.\n\nIn that way I think that the changes to this file in this CL will become a straightforward pulling out of the second half of StorageChanged() into the DoAttachStorage() callback that will get passed to |get_storage_info_func_| when it is invoked by StorageChanged().\n\nDoes that make sense?",
