      "message": "LayoutText::LinesBoundingBox() iterates on all the InlineTextBoxes to calculate the bounding box, which is the dependency this patch removes. It\u0027s also a heavy function due to the text box iteration, while checking HasNonCollapsedText() in NG consists of only 2 binary searches.\n\nRegarding the usage in other places, we may have to rely on the PhysicalFragment iteration introduced by kojii@.",

      "message": "My point is even if this patch replace one |LinesBoundingBox()| by\n|HasNonCollapsedText()|, we also have another |BoundingBoxLogicalHeight()|.\n\nHence, this function still have |LinesBoundingBox()|. Also,\nHasNonCollapseText() may be different from Rect.height !\u003d 0, e.g. using\ntiny font size.\n\nMy proposal is just leave as is, and change if we don\u0027t have\nNG version of LinesBoundingBox().\n\nSince Paint also uses LinesBoundingBox(), I think we need to have\nNG version of this.",
