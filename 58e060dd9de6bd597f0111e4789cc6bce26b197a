This chunk of code is no-op because if all the conditions were satisfied, we would retry anyway.\n\nActually, sorry I just realized what I said was not correct. This block is not no-op and removing it changed the behaviour, because --smoke essentially adds SmokeTests as a test list file, which will make the test list explicit (the file lists individual tests). I don\u0027t plan to change that behaviour in this CL, so I\u0027ll fix it up (and perhaps add a unit test).",
