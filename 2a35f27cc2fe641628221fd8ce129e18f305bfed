      "message": "I did think about this and started implemented but it actually becomes quite a bit more complicated. We need to store separate values for notifications and geolocation and we need to handle cases where the notifications DSE flag is on/off before the policy was set and after it was set. \n\nMy thought is just that this is a really rare edge case. I\u0027d even be ok leaving it reverting to ALLOW but I was just trying to be very conservative with privacy. What do you think?",
