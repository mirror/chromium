      "message": "No payment request is available on all iOS versions. It\u0027s just that DOMException isn\u0027t supported on \u003c iOS10.3. These DOMExceptions mostly serve developers when using the API and they shouldn\u0027t affect a normal working flow. I think it\u0027s acceptable to only disable the tests that depend on these DOMExceptions on \u003c iOS10.3",

      "message": "-abortPaymentRequest:reason:errorName:errorMessage:callback is also called in -abortPendingRequestWithAbortReason:errorMessage:callback which is called for normal abort/cancel scenarios. There\u0027s no error happening in those cases to log. That\u0027s why I moved out these LOG calls. I think this is fair cost to pay for a clean refactored abort/rejection code.",
