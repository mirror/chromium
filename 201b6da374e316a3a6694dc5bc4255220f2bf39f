      "message": "Calls to |EditingPositionOf| function is the main pain of this CL.\nIts like egg and chicken situation - EditingPositionOf needs a non-const Node for constructing a Position object.\nBut if I change Position to hold a |const Node*| and so EditingPositionOf can take it, then I need to change code in iterators/.\nconst_cast\u003c\u003e is ugly, and I will appreciate any advises for this.\nMaybe create some special |EditingPositionOfDeprecated(const Node*)| function to encapsulate the |const_cast\u003c\u003e| until we make a const-Position?",
