      "message": "This returns false if frame is null, so it looks like frame is now required for DidAddEventListener to work, which seems like a behavior change wrt what we had before.. Not sure if this is an issue (do we ever add a listener when frame\u003d\u003dnull?). Alternatively you could use the \"if frame \u0026\u0026 Check..\" construction like before..",
