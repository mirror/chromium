It made some sense back when Chrome was not a finished product, so a developer might want to put in a marker, but now we do want all the code we write ideally to be shippable right away, having missing parts runs counter to that. If OTOH this is simply not _expected_ to happen, it should be a DCHECK (not a NOTREACHED(), because that would be handling the condition)).",
