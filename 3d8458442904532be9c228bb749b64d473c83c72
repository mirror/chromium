      "message": "It is just a mechanical translation from the prepared CL (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/680500), in which I feel that it\u0027s better to have two mojo connections instead of one.\n\nNow the CL 680500 are still in reviewing, I left some explanation there. I also upload a draft patch(Patch set 10 of CL 680500) which only has one connection. Please help take a look and give some suggestions in CL 680500.\n\nThanks!",
