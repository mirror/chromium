So, should we add a setter to Outputter that sets the thread name from GPUTracer, may be just after l.194 below?\nPlease let me know if you have any other approach in your mind.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think gpu_timing_client_-\u003eGetTimerTypeName() is very important - or at least, we could surface the information in different ways (e.g. an explicit trace event with that name when we begin tracing), but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary.\nMaybe what is more important is that on systems where we have 2 of them (Android WebView), we can distinguish them. So I would suggest instead passing a name to the constructor, where we would have something different for GpuChannelManager vs InProcessCommandBuffer::Service (maybe \"GpuChannelManager Trace\" vs \"InProcessCommandBuffer Trace\").",
