(I had experimented with inserting something there, but I took it out. I\u0027m sure this means that path is undertested.)\n\nIf I\u0027m reading code search correctly, RestoreVertexAttribArray is only used by ScopedVertexAttribArray, and only in the case where it has a state restorer, so I can understand how this would slip through.",
