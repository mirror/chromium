      "message": "I\u0027m offline now, but now that you mention it I did forget to do anything in that path because I spent a few hours getting distracted by an issue that turned out to be unrelated. (I had experimented with inserting something there, but I took it out. I\u0027m sure this means that path is undertested.)\n\nIf I\u0027m reading code search correctly, RestoreVertexAttribArray is only used by ScopedVertexAttribArray, and only in the case where it has a state restorer, so I can understand how this would slip through.",

However I can\u0027t find any tests that test ScopedVertexAttribArray directly, do you know of any?\n\nMy instinct of course is to block this patch and the merge.
