It\u0027s really just exposing some build arguments that builds or users can set.\n\nIt would be nice to make the mac_sdk one match, can you do that also? Could be in this patch or a followup.",

      "message": "But ios_sdk.gni already exists. The purpose of putting it in a separate file is so that it can be imported on all platforms without the overhead of all the platform-specific stuff. \nOr do you mean move it to //build/config/ios_sdk.gni?",
