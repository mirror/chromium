// Every filter maintains a reference to the scheduler, who maintains data
// shared between filters (i.e., reference clock value, playback state).  The
// scheduler is also responsible for scheduling filter tasks (i.e., a read on
// a VideoDecoder would result in scheduling a Decode task).  Filters can also
// use the scheduler to signal errors and shutdown playback.
