WebP is an image format that does lossy compression of digital photographic
images. WebP consists of a codec based on VP8, that Google open-sourced in May
2010 and a container based on RIFF. Webmasters, web developers and browser
developers can use WebP to compress, archive and distribute digital images more
efficiently.

Local changes:
 * Fix cast and initialization warnings
 * Removed from types.h the risky: #ifdef ANSI / #define inline /#endif
 * Removed examples/, documentation and build related files, keeping only
   the contents of src/.
 * Merged COPYING/PATENTS to LICENSE
 * Add BGRX and RGBX variants to the WEBPImportPicture API (needs to be
   upstreamed to libwebp master).
