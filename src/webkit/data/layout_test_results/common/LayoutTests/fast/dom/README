This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

clientWidthAfterDocumentIsRemoved-expected.txt
replaceChild-expected.txt
--------------------------
These tests have incorrect expected output due to webkit bug:
http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15219
They each remove an iframe child from the document, but that iframe is
(incorrectly) present in the expected output because the render tree is
dumped prematurely.  We dump the correct tree.

anchor-toString.html
--------------------------
Replaced "file:///" with "file:///C:/" in the expected output, since GURL resolves differently than WebCore (see http://b/1089284)
