This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

--------------------------------
In r12252, we fixed bug 688933 which let javascript:<expr> set the contents
of the current document to <expr> (matching the behavior of Firefox and IE).
This test includes an iframe with src="javascript:55".  In Chrome (and
Firefox and IE), the 55 is rendered, in Safari, the 55 is not.  The test
doesn't seem to have anything to do with the contents of this iframe, so
rebaselining to include the 55.
