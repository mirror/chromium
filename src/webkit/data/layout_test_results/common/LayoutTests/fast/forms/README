This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

input-readonly-autoscroll-expected.txt
--------------------------------------
This test has been forked because of changed behavior in text drag delay for
windows.  This test doesn't initiate a drag, but the new behavior causes
it to.  The updated test that doesn't cause a drag is in
webkit/data/layout_tests/pending/.

HTMLOptionElement_label06
-------------------------
We produce the right results, but our measurements differ because of the
details of our form control style.

focus2.html
------------------------
We behave the same as Safari on these tests, except in safari, if
tab-to-links is off, option-tab(ALT + TAB) always highlights all controls
include anchor elements, see EventHandler::invertSenseOfTabsToLinks in
WebKit/WebCore/page/EventHandler.cpp and 
WebKit/WebCore/page/mac/EventHandlerMac.mm. In window platform, in layout test
mode, anchor elements can not be focusable, so in this test, our last focusable
element is BUTTON not anchor.
