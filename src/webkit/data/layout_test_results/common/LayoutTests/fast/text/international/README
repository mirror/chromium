This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

----------------------------
We behave the same as Safari win on these tests, except that our default font is
different with safari platform since it is different platform.


For the following 4 cases, we deviate from Safari's result on purpose
to match IE and Firefox's behavior better.  When no font is specified
in a file encoded in a legacy encoding, we can infer a language or
script and we use that font (instead of the Default) for  characters
not covered by the default font. Our behavior is still not the same as
that of Firefox and IE. Firefox and IE use the charset-derived font for
all the characters while we only use it for characters NOT covered by
the default font.
