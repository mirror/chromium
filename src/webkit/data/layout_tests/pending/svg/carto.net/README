----------
The original version of this test is flaky.  A window decoration
is added to one of the windows when it's create function is called
via setTimeout.  Usually, the create function is not called and
the decoration is not added.  However, in debug builds enough time
may pass and the create function is called, the decoration added,
and the diff fails.  The test has been modified to wait until all
create functions have been called before terminating.
