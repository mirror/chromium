      "message": "GetSMSProperties calls:\nPropertySet::RegisterProperty(): This just calls Property::Init() which has no obvious side effects.\nPropertySet::GetAll(): This invokes a DBus method (kPropertiesInterface, kPropertiesGetAll) which will call OnGetAll() and invoke this, but that should never occur immediately, the callback should always be posted to a task on the same thread. It looks like we even do the right thing in the fake implementation: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chromeos/dbus/fake_sms_client.cc?q\u003dsms_client.cc\u0026dr\u0026l\u003d43\n\nSo, we should not need to post this, unless I missed something.",
