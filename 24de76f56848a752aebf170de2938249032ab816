      "message": "\"callback binding\" is a bit unclear. I would suggest wording the comment like this:\n\nDon\u0027t reject binding to a base::Callback with no additional arguments.\n\nbase::Bind rejected binding to a base::Callback without extra bound arguments:\ndoing this is redundant and wasteful since it creates a new Callback object when\nthe original one could have been directly used.\n\nHowever, this forces templated code that uses base::Bind() to provide a\nspecialization for the no-argument case: instead, just specialize base::Bind()\nto return the original callback in this case.\n\nwhich makes it clear that this is about calling base::Bind() with Callback as the function object. (I also think it\u0027s not necessary to say base::Bind family, since I think most people will understand that this means all the bind helpers)",
