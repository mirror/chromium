      "message": "Ned, do you have a better suggestion for what to do here? These base classes are protected, so I can\u0027t import them into my contrib benchmark directly.  However, if I make them public, then the benchmark discoverer finds them, which leads to them being treated as \"runnable\" benchmarks which is wrong in a number of cases.\n\nI\u0027m really not happy copying and pasting, but am not sure what your preference is here for how to handle this.",
