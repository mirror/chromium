      "message": "I believe this is the only behavior change. Before, XSLImportRule::Href() would return the raw href as passed in to XSLStyleSheet::LoadChildSheet(). After, child-\u003ehref() will return the result of applying BaseURL() to href. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m qualified to decide whether that\u0027s safe. This does mean we\u0027re using the same href that\u0027s exposed to JS, though.",
