      "message": "ah, interesting.\n\nWe need to be able to distinguish between:\n  1) A memory dump with [tracing disabled], solely for hte purposes of getting memory dumps.\n  2) An incomplete memory dump b/c the OS was killed, hence no os_dump.\n\nFurthermore, there\u0027s the additional question in case (2) for whether the service should be the one to prune the half-finished data. I\u0027m inclined to say yes.\n\nIn this case, this CL isn\u0027t quite correct, since it breaks the pruning logic for (2). Blergh. This really feels like everything would be simpler/faster if we had a separate interface method to just grab process dumps.\n\nbrettw: If you can find a way to distinguish between (1) and (2), I\u0027d be okay with moving forward, but we can\u0027t just get rid of the conditional here.",
