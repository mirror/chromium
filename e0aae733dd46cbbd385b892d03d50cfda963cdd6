      "message": "did you ever work out the that problem with the pop up test?\n\nmaybe the problem is that with window.open pop ups, sync_compositor_ can actually be null here in webview. Those pop ups are weird because it\u0027s WebContents that\u0027s created from within content rather than created by embedder, so some initialization stuff are out of order..\n\nwhich means more state tracking :(",
