      "message": "CCTestSuite and other subclasses of TestSuit that have a message loop, take down the message loop in Shutdown(). This is called from dtor, after Shutdown(). So, I think this won\u0027t crash.\n\nI agree that it looks weird that BeginTracing is called from Initialize(), but EndTracingIfNeeded() is not called from Shutdown() and is called from dtor, instead. But, that\u0027s a different problem that should be resolved in a different CL perhaps?",
