      "message": "The TODO was needed in case new workers were added during JoinForTesting (after |workers_copy| is made), which could happen because of new tasks being posted.\n\nInstead, it was easier and simpler to just require that someone who uses JoinForTesting cannot post a task after JoinForTesting is called. No one currently does this anyways (and it wouldn\u0027t really make sense to) - though it did require Flush() being called in case of nested tasks.",
