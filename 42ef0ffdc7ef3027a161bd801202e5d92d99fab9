Please check \"Data alignment for speed: myth or reality?\": \nhttps://lemire.me/blog/2012/05/31/data-alignment-for-speed-myth-or-reality/.\n\nIt seems that starting from 2010 onwards, Intel processors have improved remarkably on the way they handle unaligned memory access. I don\u0027t see much of a benefit of having to support legacy CPUs that are older than 7  years (as we get trapped in the legacy issue that is a curse in zlib).\n\nSo unless we have compelling data to prove its benefits, it is better to just simplify the code and remove this block.",
