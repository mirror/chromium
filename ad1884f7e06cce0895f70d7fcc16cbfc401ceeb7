      "message": "Does this mean if we have a very long path and a very short width to display it in, we will elide the end of the domain (incl. TLD) + path instead of the subdomain + path?\n\nIf so that seems like another TODO for a later fix.  We should probably check whether the string would fit if we replaced the whole path with an ellipsis; if so, we\u0027re good to elide using the existing method, but if not, then we should further elide from the front.\n\nWhich is basically what the code below will do.  I wonder whether the loop this was guarding has disappeared and this code can just go away, or if it\u0027s merely moved to a helper and we still have a concern.",
