      "message": "Hmm, I would still prefer avoiding doing some complex work in ctor. Because;\n- Start() looks to have clear semantics to me, and running complicated code like this in ctor often makes maintenance difficult.\n- I prefer to keep the symmetric what\u0027s done in ctor and dtor, if possible.\n- This change could make testing difficult. There is no guarantee that StartArcInstance is async (though it is recommended, and real implementation does so currently), so OnMiniInstanceStarted() could be called synchronously. In case of failing, there is no chance to register observers.\n- In this specific case, it is difficult for me to find a benefit to remove the Start() here, TBH.\n\nTo me, StartArcInstance() is still fail-able method, so I prefer following https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Doing_Work_in_Constructors and avoiding this to done in the ctor.",

      "message": "As we pointed out in the email thread, this is undesirable. I was under the impression that the solution was to extract this blob to a function that is unconditionally called from [1] (which is what hidehiko@ points out in the style guide), so that the caller of ArcSession::Create() will always get a fully-initialized mini instance, or nullptr. The ctor and this function can be a friend of ArcSession::Create() so that nobody can have a semi-initialized ArcSessionImpl, which would in spirit make it typesafe, even though internally the NOT_STARTED state might exist.\n\n1: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/arc/arc_session.cc?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d23",

      "message": "Hidehiko: just to be fair, what the guide says is \"avoid it *if you can\u0027t signal an error*\" and in this case, StartArcInstance itself returns void and can signal an error via the callback for sure. So I don\u0027t think this violates the guide. The guide basically just says \"don\u0027t create a semi-constructed object\" and this code doesn\u0027t seem to have the concern. Yes, we do avoid long ctor because in most cases such code will have a semi-constructed object problem, but this particular code seems okay to me.\n\nAlso, re your 4th point, the benefit of this is one reduced state (NOT_STARTED is gone), which I guess Chris long wanted to do :) So this is not all cons. I personally don\u0027t care if the session_manager_client call is in ctor or not, as long as L255-265 is factored out to a separate non-virtual function like Start(), maybe. This doesn\u0027t seem like a big deal to me (and I\u0027d defer to you.)\n\nThe ease of testing is a good point and it might force us to revert back to the original idea (in the email thread) though.",

      "message": "As Yusuke mentioned, there isn\u0027t a chance of failure here, so we can\u0027t have a partially constructed object. No matter what the result of the constructor, the object will be valid. We have no way of a \"Create\" function returning None since we can\u0027t know if the dbus call fails synchronously. Even if the dbus call does fail, it doesn\u0027t make ArcSessionImpl inconsistent, it\u0027s meant to handle that. Due to this, I don\u0027t see there being an effective difference between putting it in a factory or a constructor (mostly because the factory can\u0027t return a None), so I opted for the choice with less functions and code.\n\nAs for the testing, I don\u0027t see this being an issue, because we already use a FakeArcSession for unit tests anyways.\nThe call to StartArcInstance being async is pretty baked into the design. If it wasn\u0027t async, you likely wouldn\u0027t need observers and would just directly handle the result of the call from the call site. We can always change it if ever we need it to be async, but I think a lot more than that would change. I wouldn\u0027t design the code now for a change so major and that we don\u0027t have a reason to think we\u0027ll need. As they say: you ain\u0027t gonna need it.",
