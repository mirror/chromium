When we get a kCORS response from a serviceworker, what is the expected state of the access-control-allow-origin header -- and\n\nI don\u0027t really know what kCORS means here.  I assume that it means that a service worker has cached a responses performed with CORS (if CORS allowed the response, then the service worker could have seen and could have cached a full response;  otherwise the service worker would have seen and cache an error maybe?).\n\nI am pretty confident that in this case the response doesn\u0027t come from the network, but from the service worker.\n\n\u003e do the renderer-side CORS checks still apply?\n\nI think they don\u0027t apply anymore - see ResourceLoader::DetermineCORSStatus which stops doing CORS checks and returns CORSStatus::kServiceWorkerSuccessful after determining that the response came not from the network, but from a service worker (with network::mojom::FetchResponseType::kCORS).\n\nI think this is okay.  Renderer\u0027s + XSDB\u0027s CORS checks will still apply to the initial network -\u003e service_worker response.",
