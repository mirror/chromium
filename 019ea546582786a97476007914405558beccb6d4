The general pattern used is you define platform independent file in the ui directory (or this directory) and then platform specific files in the appropriate platform directory. For example, c/b/ui/browser uses BrowserWindow, which is defined in c/b/ui/browser_window. The views implementation of BrowserWindow is in c/b/ui/views/frame/browser_view.h.",

      "message": "The reason chrome/browser/DEPS has a -chrome/browser/ui/views is twofold. We do not want circular dependencies between browser code and the actual ui code, and the code in chrome/browser should talk to UI code using platform independent interfaces (as I discuss above). That you had to update DEPS here isn\u0027t the right solution.\n\nYou have two options:\n. Introduce platform independent interfaces that views implements.\n. Move all this code into c/b/ui/views/feature_engagement (this only works if you have no other dependencies on the code in this directory from non-ui code).",
