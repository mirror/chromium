      "message": "Note that here (and in all other instances) I had to change \"web_state()\" to \"web_state\" because the function from the super class is hidden by the parameter with the same name. Both should be equal.\n\nAn alternative is to use WebStateObserver::web_state() instead (i.e. use the fully qualified name that is not hidden by the local variable) but I think it is too verbose (and will have to be eventually changed to web_state anyway when the function is removed in order to allow the Observer to observe multiple WebStates).",
