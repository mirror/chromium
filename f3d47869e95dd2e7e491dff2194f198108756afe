If so, would it be better to have this owned by RequestCoordinator? Just a thought, probably no need to address in this CL.",

There is a shared instance of ui::ResourceBundle (see https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/base/resource/resource_bundle.h?rcl\u003ddf97778dec61a7c5bd0702f7f352e33514bc33cb\u0026l\u003d152).
