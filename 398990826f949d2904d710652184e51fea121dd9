      "message": "Enabling the shortcuts provider lgtm, but I don\u0027t understand the implications of enabling the zerosuggest provider.  \n\nHow aggressively does the zerosuggest provider trigger?  Will it cause the popup to open whenever the omnibox is focused?  That would be a huge change in UI that I\u0027d need to run through Mardini and other folks.",

      "message": "Zero suggest on Android triggers on every (non-incognito) page.\n\n\"Rarely\" is the triggering rate on desktop, where the suggestions are based on the context of the current page.\n\nOn mobile it provides the user\u0027s most visited suggestions.\n\nEnable zero suggest on iOS is a major change.  You may even want to go through launch review.  This is not subtle, and all iOS engineers and leads will notice when you turn it on.  At a minimum, you should check that the UI animation of zero suggest displaying looks good, as users will be seeing it a ton.\n\n(Zero suggest can currently appear on iOS when there\u0027s a \"link you copied\" in the clipboard.  But this happens rarely.  If you\u0027re going to increase the rate at which the zero suggest dropdown is open by a factor of ~100x, you should make sure you\u0027re comfortable with how it looks.)\n\nYou will also need to change these lines to get this feature properly enabled.\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/omnibox/browser/omnibox_field_trial.cc?q\u003domnibox_fie\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d279\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/omnibox/browser/omnibox_field_trial.cc?q\u003domnibox_fie\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d299",
