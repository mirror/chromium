      "message": "I think this change to the \"\u003c if expr\u003d\" is what caused the bug. It appears these resources are used in non-VR Android code (I\u0027ll paste the compile errors on crbug/735676). If these resources are really meant to be VR-only, then the other code probably shouldn\u0027t be running on non-VR android.",

But it looks like these IDS also included in Android\u0027s R string and used a different name.\nI will fix it in reland and will try the failing bot before submit.",
