      "message": "Sorry for the late response Michael.\nYes, I think testing the behavior here, even it\u0027s wrong, it\u0027s not proper. I will put the page into a standalone HTML file: I assume it should resolve the issue, since fullscreen keyboard lock page needs to be loaded synchronously to ensure the test pass.\n\nI may add another test case into chrome/test/base/uit_test_utils_test.cc (though I hate the test of test utils) to cover the wrong behavior.",
