      "message": "ArcWallpaperService uses image ID to identify which SetCustomWallpaper request causes OnWallpaperDataChanged here. However image_id stored at #125 is no longer valid because the ImageSkia is once converted into SkBitmap in WallpaperControllerClient. Also image_id is only unique in a process, so we cannot use image_id to identify SetCustomWallpaper request here.\n\nIs it possible to ask implementing something which enables ArcWallpaperService to identify which SetCustomWallpaper request causes OnWallpaperDataChanged?",
