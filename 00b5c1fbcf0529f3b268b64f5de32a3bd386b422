(During shutdown, already-started tasks will just be abandoned, while with SKIP_ON_SHUTDOWN we still wait for them to complete. Posted-but-not-yet-started tasks are skipped either way.) The downside is that it\u0027s not always safe to use, but since we already have another instance, I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s okay here.",
