      "message": "From the perspective of a CompositingRecorder user, it\u0027s not clear that bounds is a performance hint if passed without clip_to_bounds. WDYT of combining bounds and clip_to_bounds so that passing a nullptr for bounds implies no clip? This could, regrettably, add some clips in cases where we know the bounds but my intuition is that those are not common.",
