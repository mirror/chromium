      "message": "Well, that\u0027s almost where we got stuck in the previous CL: https://codereview.chromium.org/2447133002/. ProxyServer can be serialized by converting it to a string (see that previous CL). However, it\u0027s not clear what would be the impact on cache if we change the pickling logic.\n\nmmenke@: suggestions on who should review this to understand the impact on cache? Assuming that your comment from  https://codereview.chromium.org/2447133002/#msg14 about the unfamiliarity still holds.",
