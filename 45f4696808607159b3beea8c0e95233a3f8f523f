      "message": "i think you may need to add new capabilities to the RegistryVerifier to make this work. the test generally runs with a 32-bit python.exe, so _winreg will look in the 32-bit hive. this happens to be correct for all of the Google Update keys, but will be wrong for this. the right thing will take a bit of work, since the bitness of python.exe has no relation to the bitness of the chrome installer. here are my suggestions:\n\n1. add support to VariableExpander.__init__ for sniffing out the bitness of Chrome (note that it figures out Chromium vs Google Chrome via sniffing). maybe add a variable to the mapping, or add a new member variable to hold this.\n2. change RegistryVerifier so that by default it uses the correct \"default\" hive based on the bitness of Chrome (KEY_WOW64_64KEY if Chrome is x64, or KEY_WOW64_32KEY if Chrome is x86).\n\nat this point, the registry verifier will behave predictably, in that it\u0027ll look in the 64-bit hive when testing 64-bit Chrome, and the 32-bit hive when testing 32-bit Chrome. this will cause new test failures, though, so we then need to:\n\n3. add support to RegistryVerifier for a new value in expectation dicts to override the default (e.g., \"wow_key\": \"KEY_WOW64_32KEY\").\n4. change existing prop files so that they explicitly list \"wow_key\": \"KEY_WOW64_32KEY\" for all registry access relating to Google Update. there may be others as well.\n\nit makes sense to do this in its own CL rather than mixing it with this one.",
