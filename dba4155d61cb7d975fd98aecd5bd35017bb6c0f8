      "message": "I\u0027m not sold on this and would like other people\u0027s opinions. Both the number badge and the text badge need the same constraints, so it is not controversial to abstract that out into its own method. But then I thought that none of the constraints *really* depended on the ReadingListMenuViewCell, so I abstracted it again into class method. The instance method just wraps the class method with the ReadingListMenuViewCell\u0027s views as the parameters. Is this overengineering?",
