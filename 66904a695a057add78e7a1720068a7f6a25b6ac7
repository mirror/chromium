      "message": "This doesn\u0027t seem right is it? Is a gamepad a direct manipulation device? ie; the RouteTouchscreenGestureEvent tracks who the target is (from the touch start) and route events to that target. If it is likely we should change the name of the method I guess but I presume that the routing is in fact wrong.",

      "message": "So this gets complicated. In that this variable will probably always be false. Because I believe you aren\u0027t generated a GestureScrollBegin when you are generating the fling? So that gesture_scroll_on_impl_thread is only determined in the Begin phase it will likely send gamepad scrolling to the main thread which isn\u0027t ideal at all.",
