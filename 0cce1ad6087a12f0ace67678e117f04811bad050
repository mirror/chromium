      "message": "It seems inconsistent to record |isChecked| metrics here if they are not actually applied - is that intended? (comment?)\n\nPerhaps this line and the `if (isChecked) {..} condition can move down into the if (blockState \u003d\u003d ...) condition below.\n\nBUT! I think the meaning of the UMA is totally changing, so we need a new UMA metric so it doesn\u0027t have a mix of meanings across versions.\n\nold meaning \"always prevent foo from opening links\"\nnew meaning \"always use foo to open links\"",

I\u0027m less sure about suppressing the next line as well.. but it\u0027s unusual for Cancel and ESC to behave differently at all (ESC on mac usually just \"clicks\" a cancel button - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/1532992-buttons?language\u003dobjc ).",
