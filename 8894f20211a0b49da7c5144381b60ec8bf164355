      "message": "Still, sub_value is a string (as it\u0027s iterating over all keys from the field_value dict), and sub_field.name is a string. So the \"in\" operator here is applied to two strings, which works as searching the left operand in the right operand as a substring - which is not what is wanted here (for instance, with two fields \"foo\" and \"foobar\" they will be confused).\n\nSo, IIUC, \"\u003d\u003d\" has to be used instead of \"in\". But, then, the searching for the needed element can be written in a simpler manner - with a single loop over all sub_field\u0027s and with searching of sub_field.name in field_value.",
