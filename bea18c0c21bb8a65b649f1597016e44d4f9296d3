      "message": "Did a lot of hacking and finally arrived at the below css style to make it work. But then realized that it won\u0027t work on other platforms. There seems to be layout differences.\nSo i think we cannot upstream this test for now as the ref test is not possible, if that is the case i will abandone this change. Or do you have any other thoughts?",

      "message": "Do the problems stem from the fact that positioning is done using inline-level elements (\u003cspan\u003e)? Doing that usually yields problems due to font metrics (and thus rendering) differences between platforms. I\u0027d try recreating more of the actual cue layout - i.e wrap the \u003cspan\u003es with the text in a \u003cdiv\u003e and position the \u003cdiv\u003e et.c.",
