      "message": "Please bring back this function. Previously, we would pass a success and error callback to SetPowered() to see if things worked. With the new flow, we no longer need a special success callback, since we know things succeeded if DeviceListChanged() gets called. However, we don\u0027t have any special callback if enabling Bluetooth failed. Thus, we need to use a Timer here. Let\u0027s use 2 seconds as the time limit, since this really should happen almost instantaneously. If a timeout occurs, let\u0027s set the toggle back to off, as we did in OnsetPoweredError().\n\nAlso, please do not call ToggleBluetoothEnabled(). You never know if some other code *just* tried to enable it before you called this. Instead, let\u0027s use SetPrimaryUserBluetoothPowerSetting().",
