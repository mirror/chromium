      "message": "This looks dangerous.  If something causes every iteration to fail, won\u0027t you stay in this loop indefinitely?  If you need a certain number of samples, but grabbing a sample can fail, it feels like you want two nested loops - the original outer for loop to grab n samples, and an inner retry loop.  If the inner loop fails more than once (or some number of times), the whole test would bail out.  Thoughts?",

      "message": "Structurally, this would read better (and maybe be more robust) if you simply didn\u0027t increment iteration_counter unless the loop iteration succeeded.  Decrementing a loop index variable is a bit odd.  I also think it should be called samples_obtained.  A failed iteration is still an iteration.",
