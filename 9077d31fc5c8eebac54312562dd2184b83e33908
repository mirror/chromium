      "message": "I think these fixes are correct but I would have expected more new tests to pass with these changes. For example, RequiresCompositingForOpacityAnimation is called in PaintPropertyTreeBuilder and should result in underinvalidation of properties. Can you make a concrete test that crashes with underinvalidation without one of these checks? I don\u0027t think we need a test for each one, just want to understand why these aren\u0027t crashing more often.",
