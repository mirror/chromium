      "message": "It is not very clear why this client is separate form the Client. In reality, they are probably always the same object.\n\nAlso, there is a mismatch of callback mechanism: Client is supposed to call SnapshotController::PreviousSnapshotCompleted() when it\u0027s done with snapshot, while the RenovationClient is supposed to invoke a callback. This is inconsistent.\n\nAlso, it looks that RenovationClient should not be optional. If SbnapshotController has to produce RunRenovations call, it should always do that, and leave it up to client to act upon it or not.\n\nAlso, the \"otherwise a snapshot will be taken after the given timeout\" seems to create a flaky conditions that would depend on speeds of CPU/Network etc. It creates a race between 2 triggers. At the level of interface, there should be only one trigger.\n\nI\u0027d propose merge of Client and RenovaitonClient, unifying the callback solution and spelling out a specific single sequence of calls to the client.",
