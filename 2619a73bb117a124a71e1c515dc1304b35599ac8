It is not a light weight task\". The service worker context is simply a member variable of the storage partition and retrieving the partition is a map lookup.\n\nThe cost of looking these things up is also no different than it is before this change and what it continues to be for every non-incognito session.\n\nGranted, I could manually merge I just prefer an automatic merge because a) I\u0027m lazy and b) the automated process creates a nicer log trail.",
