      "message": "Ugh, this is sort of a mess.\n\nAFAICT, only subclasses need this active tab.  And they really only need it to get at the top-level native window (to parent dialogs to) or the top-level dialog manager.  Mac in particular has a lot of APIs that pass around WebContents when really the endpoint classes don\u0027t really rely on a WebContents, but on e.g. a dialog manager; bad for dependency injection.\n\nIt seems like rather than supplying a Browser here it would be nice to supply the single top-level object to host dialogs in.  That would more accurately state what this class depends on and make things more testable.  However, it would take some refactoring to do this sort of thing.",
