Maybe sometimes we\u0027re waiting for a response that has already been read?\n\nThis test used to be part of the remote_test_server code, which wasn\u0027t compiled at all on iOS.  It started getting run on iOS last Friday, and it\u0027s been flaky ever since.  This is causing a large percentage of main waterfall runs to fail, so I have to do something in the short term to get the bots green again.",
