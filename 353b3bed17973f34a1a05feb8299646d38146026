      "message": "We have precedent for this with AddEVCA() and RemoveEVCA() which are no-ops on unsupported platforms.\n\nThe reason I want stubs is having it as a compile-time dependency means I either need to add additional ifdefs into CertVerifyProcBuiltin (which needs to check EV oids), or I need to change the build files to stop compiling that on other platforms.\n\nThe coupling of those dependencies doesn\u0027t really seem right - CertVerifyProcBuiltin should just take a EVRootCAMetadata. This is a general problem we have faced with other things like the test roots dependency or cert store dependency, since existing code has expressed them in a way that is tightly coupled to the platform cert representation and platform cert verifier implementation.",
