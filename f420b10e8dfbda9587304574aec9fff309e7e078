      "message": "I think that I did the split std::string/const char* thing in mini_chromium because it was a better way to distinguish between “string is set but is (inexplicably) empty” and “string isn’t set” while also being 100% clean to pass to os_log directly. As far as the former concern goes, I was also trying to mirror exactly the underlying behavior of CF.",
