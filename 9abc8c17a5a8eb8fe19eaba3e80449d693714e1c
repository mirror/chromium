      "message": "You meant: \"make the test early exit if the network service is **enabled**\", right?\n\nYes I can, but it means we will forget that this test fails with the NetworkService. Do you plan to keep it like this or making a new tests that will replace it at some point?\n\nIn BrowserSideNavigationBaseBrowserTest.CancelRequestAfterReadyToCommit (which is similar), I wanted to remove the early exit and add a filter. I guess you want to keep it in its current state.",
