      "message": "I haven\u0027t yet looked at the CL, but note that there\u0027s precedent for this:\n\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/modules/payments/PaymentAddress.h?q\u003dPaymentAddress.h+package:%5Echromium$\u0026dr\u003dCSs\u0026l\u003d9\n\nIt would be worth tracking down the introduction of that dependency to find out what discussions were had around it. I agree with Kentaro that this is dicey territory (although note that //components isn\u0027t a monolithic target, so we\u0027re not *inherently* creating a cycle). Either we should document the conditions under which this is allowed, or we should fix the existing case in the codebase.",
