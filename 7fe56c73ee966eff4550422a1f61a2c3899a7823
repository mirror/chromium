      "message": "I don\u0027t have any virtual tests. I agree that it would be useful.\nWhat I do is rebasing \"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/852094\" on top of my current CL and run the try bots ;-)\n\nI have a very limited number of browsertests where \"NavigationMojoResponse\" is enabled.\n\nIf I want to add virtual tests, I think I need at least the /http/tests/ directory (and probably /external/wpt/)\nIt will probably adds a non negligible performance penalty for the commit queue, so I am not sure if it worth the cost.\n\nWhat would have been best would have been a NavigationMojoResponse FYI trybot.\nAfter this CL, there are no more failing WebKit tests. I need to update/move a few tests in navigation_url_loader_unittests and one browsertest.",
