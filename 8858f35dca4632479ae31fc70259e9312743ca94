      "message": "On a second thought, we might not be able to delete PendingWallpaper. Suppose the following scenario: User opens Wallpaper Picker app (or whatever Wallpaper App), and clicks on the image gird items very quickly to send several setWallpaper requests in a short amount of time. We should make sure the last selected image is set as the current wallpaper and PendingWallpaper is a way to do it. But after delete it, it seems there is no guarantee which image will be set as the wallpaper as the image decoding and set image are async calls. Sorry for the extra work.",

      "message": "I see. I believe the implementation of PendingWallpaper can\u0027t handle this case. Since SetOnlineWallpaper and SetCustomWallpaper both have ImageSkia as parameter, so the decoding already finished by the time it reaches wallpaper manager. So in theory, the final wallpaper is always the one that finished decoding last, not the one that the user selected last. If PendingWallpaper starts rate limiting before decoding starts, then it can solve your use case.\n\nI just tried the wallpaper picker and it has progress bar for each image, it seems that it\u0027s able to always set the last selected wallpaper.. and I do plan to move the decoding code from wallpaper_api/priate_api to WallpaperController, so that we can implement a new PendingWallpaper that starts to work before decoding, if needed.",

      "message": "Not related to this CL: I think the ephemeral user\u0027s behavior might have been broken (not sure when). If I understand it correctly, a ephemeral user should still be able to set/change his own wallpaper (if no user policy is specified) but the wallpaper info just doesn\u0027t persist through logout/shutdown. Can you add a TODO here so that we can revisit the logic of the ephemeral user?",
