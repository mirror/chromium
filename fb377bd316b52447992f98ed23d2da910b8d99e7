      "message": "This isn\u0027t perfectly reliable to get the tiles updated, if I run the test in succession. Here are some options, but I\u0027m open to other suggestions (especially if things are done differently on iOS):\n1. Create an observer like https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/559540\nThis will make the tests more similar.\n2. Find some user action that will 100% cause the tiles to be updated, which would be more of a user facing test.\n3. Explicitly call top_sites::SyncWithHistory. More directly does what we need, but may short-circuit what the test is verifying.",
