      "message": "I am not either :) My idea is that because the name can only be set by the device owner (and is seen the same by every user), this is local state rather than user preference. I can be wrong of course. How would you handle that case?\n\nJulian?",

      "message": "Correct whatever preference is global for all profiles should end up in the local state pref store. In case of something only settable by one user (or none in case of enterprise owned device) this is fine. Putting here something that everyone can edit is a recipe for chaos unfortunately there are cases where this is unavoidable like for keyboard layouts that sort-of kind-of have to be preserved on the login screen too. \n\nYour case is clear and fine though. :)",
