Has any thought been given to how this would work post-network-stack servicification?",

I don\u0027t know what the status is of network-stack servicification,  it seemed a long way off last time I looked.\n\nWe don\u0027t have a design doc for this particular feature, but I\u0027ve added a bug which contains some more context. Let me know if that works for you.",

We are aiming for launching this in the first half of next year, so we would like to avoid new features being added that don\u0027t work with the network service.",
