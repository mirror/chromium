      "message": "This also means that you will not be sending events to a page when it\u0027s being hidden (e.g. during tab-switch). I think this would break this case: (1) hover over something in a page, so that the hover effect shows up (2) without moving the mouse cursor, switch to a different tab (e.g. by pressing ctrl+tab). (3) move mouse cursor so that it is no longer on top of the page. (4) switch back to the previous page (e.g. ctrl+shift+tab). I think you will see that the page still has the hover effect. So this is not something you should do here. Instead, I think you want this to happen only when this is called from WindowTreeHost::OnCursorVisibilityChanged(). As noted in event.h, I think this information should be included in Event:flags_. So this function should take an option MouseEventFlags as input, which OnCursorVisibilityChanged() will use to set EF_CURSOR_VISBILITY from here.",

      "message": "This is pretty weird. Code in a lower layer like ui/events/ shouldn\u0027t ideally differentiate between views and blink.\n\nI agree with bokan@ on crbug that we probably should dispatch some event other than EXITED. (e.g. perhaps a ET_CURSOR_VISIBLITY_CHANGED or something). But, if we want to continue sending EXITED, then it would be better to add a MouseEventFlags for that, e.g. EF_CURSOR_VISIBILITY or something like that. Code in content/browser can then filter those out and not send to blink.",
