      "message": "Yes please only expose runner interfaces, this makes it so much easier to migrate to something else later.\n\nEven better would be to only expose something like RenderThreadImpl::CreateFileTaskRunner() which would return a scoped_refptr\u003cbase::SequencedTaskRunner\u003e. Currently this could always be the same underlying task runner which happens to be a single thread but the API should be clear that these can be independent which will allow you to later do a simple switch where those sequences are actually sharing a pool (a la TaskScheduler + post_task.h).\n\nI\u0027m saying this because the hardest part of migrating to TaskScheduler in the browser is sharding BrowserThread::FILE\u0027s users into individual sequences and figuring out all the implicit dependencies. If your API asks users to make this decision from the get go (before the impl actually shards the work) then you at least have the proper labelling from the callers which is by far the hardest part.",

      "message": "Happy to make whatever changes are necesary. I agree that exposing threads and/or SingleThreadTaskRunners is a bad idea. I\u0027m just not really sure what the best way to do so would be. What code would be creating the thread and/or task runner? What code would own the thread and/or task runner? What API exposes it to blink, and what API exposes it to content?\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to interpret both the suggestion that BlinkPlatformImpl (a class in content) should be the access point to this task runner, but it should be created within blink. How does BlinkPlatformImpl then get access to it?\n\nShould blink::RendererScheduler have a new CreateFileTaskRunner method that returns a WebTaskRunner, which RenderThreadImpl then gets here and owns, passing it to BlinkPlatformImpl to expose it back to blink?\n\nAnd under the hood CreateFileTaskRunner of course still has to somehow create a base::SingleThreadTaskRunner to back the WebTaskRunner.\n\nOf course WebTaskRunner still has the problem that it explicitly exposes a single thread task runner, so you\u0027re not saving any of the migration pains if you later want to move the anything other than a single thread. I\u0027m not even sure if blink has an API to expose a SequencedTaskRunner (is there an overview of blink task scheduling APIs somewhere?)",
