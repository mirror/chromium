      "message": "I tried reverting the remainder of this CL and running the test (Because I wanted to see the CL in action!) and this test still passes. \n\nIt looks like the test passes because page_with_insecure_favicon.html references a non-existing favicon. Locally, I changed the test page to:\n- pass the favicon URL as a query parameter\n- Used JavaScript to create the \u003clink\u003e node with the query parameter URL\nBased on running this changed test, it looks like the http favicon download is not blocked. :( I didn\u0027t do any further investigation.",
