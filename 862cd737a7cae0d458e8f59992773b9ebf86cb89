      "message": "This is partially copy \u0026 pasted from ClipPathClipper, where it computes the bounds for canvas-\u003esaveLayer(). The one in CPC is currently a bit intertwined to the actual paint code. I plan to remove it when I refactor the class to do mask-based only.\n\nIn SPv1 I believe it issues a full layer invalidation, therefore the bounds were not needed.\nAlso the rendering glitch does reproduces SPv1 due to incorrect cull rect used by the RTree.",

Having to override different function in different classes: LayoutBox::AddSelfVisualOverflow(), LayoutInline::VisualOverflowRect(), SVGLayoutSupport::LocalVisualRect().\n\n2. Clip path can reference SVG, which could potentially cross document boundary. Doing it late to ensure all document reached post-layout lifecycle.",
