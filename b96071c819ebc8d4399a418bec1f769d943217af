      "message": "Can this be called if OnStartedLoadingBackgroundTabs() was not called? That would result in a DCHECK failure because InitializeMetrics would not have been called.\n\nSuppose we\u0027re towards the end of session and the user opens some tabs in the background. If all pending navigations begin loading before session restore ends, we wouldn\u0027t get the start signal, right? Suppose then that there is one bg tab that finishes loading after session restore ends. Would IsLoadingBackgroundTabs() return true then? If so, would this fire when the bg tab finishes loading?",
