I\u0027d just like to make 100% sure that this will have no adverse side-effects to other tests in ios_chrome_integration_egtests. \n\n2. We have to add the flag at this point, so it goes to the app? Adding it in our test.json files won\u0027t work because that is loaded in the XCTest, after the target is loaded?",

Other tests don\u0027t do it and also would have no reason to call CM API.\n\n2. Actually, it seems sufficient to add the flag in our .json files. The feature just needs to be enabled before the first test case is executed (\u003dwhen the first tab is opened).",
