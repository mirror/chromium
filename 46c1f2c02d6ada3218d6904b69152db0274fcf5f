      "message": "This include was moved from cc/ipc/cc_serialization_perftest.cc to here.  Kyle noticed in an earlier review that cc/ipc/cc_serialization_perftest.cc was including begin_frame_args_struct_traits but didn\u0027t reference BeginFrameArgs directly - it needed the include because it was using CompositorFrameMetadata.  Moving the include to this directory seemed to make more sense.",
