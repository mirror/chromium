      "message": "First of all, we can change it to true.\n\nBut I believe it doesn\u0027t matter since it would do initialization during the startup by powerd\u0027 backlights forced off state when PowerButtonDisplayController is constructed in [1].\n\nWe have backlights_forced_off_ initialized to false in FakePowerManagerClient. If you have to set to true here. I believe it is because PBDC doesn\u0027t get backlights forced off state. Will a base::RunLoop().RunUntilIdle() help here?\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ash/system/power/power_button_display_controller.cc?sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d41",
