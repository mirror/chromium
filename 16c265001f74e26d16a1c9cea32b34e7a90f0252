Wrong predicted.\n\nSince we can\u0027t really assert if the rationalization was good since it depends on the prediction.\n\nSo you\u0027d have\n\nGOOD_RATIONALIZATION\nBAD_RATIONALIZATION\nWRONG_PREDICTED_TYPE\n\nThat way we have exactly one log for each field. And we can evaluate what to improve.\n\nWDYT?",
