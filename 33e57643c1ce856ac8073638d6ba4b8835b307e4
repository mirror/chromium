      "message": "It is still not completely clear to me. I don\u0027t see it exposed in histogram data, but that doesn\u0027t mean it isn\u0027t used in the process somewhere. All the documentation in the header says is: \"|name| is used to label threads and histograms. It should identify the component that creates the TaskScheduler.\" It doesn\u0027t look like there is a default value for it, in ios/web we use and empty string, but have it commented that we do that so that it matches the browser process. I added fdoray@ as a TaskScheduler owner to comment on the name\u0027s importance.",

      "message": "I think you are right about the network change notifier. Although I put it here in Create, I missed the fact that even in ios/web we were doing this after the message loop was created. I think I will need to break NetworkChangeNotifier::Create() out into another method.\n\nI think the BuildMessageLoop should be separate. I want to make minimal (none if possible) changes to the startup logic for both Cronet and iOS Chrome to avoid introducing difficult to debug issues. The ios/web startup is quite complex so I wanted to initialize in the same order.",
