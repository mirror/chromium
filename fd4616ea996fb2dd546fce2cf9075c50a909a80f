      "message": "output_dpb_size_ is required by the decoder, while kDpbOutputBufferExtraCount is an additional requirement, in addition to output_dpb_size_. These buffers are to fill the pipeline in the client, so while decoder is decoding, the client has some buffers to work with. Similarly, if we have a longer pipeline that includes an image processor, we need additional buffers for it to work with as well.\n\nSo we need a sum of all, not a max, otherwise we will stall if for example the processor or the client holds a frame (or more) in conversion/rendering, because we will not have enough buffers to decode.",
