      "message": "I don\u0027t think so, hence the DCHECK on line 77. According to the current code, if that ever happened, we would replace the first infobar and leave the second one there, which is not the intended UX, but would not crash or anything. \nThe issue would be that we managed to add one extra in the first place. \nMaybe some race condition when ReplaceInfoBar has removed the old one but not added the new one yet? That runs on the UI thread though, so I don\u0027t see how that would be possible.",
