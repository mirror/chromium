I added ui_base_features.cc in r510764, so doing this should be straightforward. Note this launch will interact with SecondaryUiMd, which is in the same place, so keeping them together would be nice.\n\n(aside - note there\u0027s also interaction with MaterialDesignController::MATERIAL_HYBRID -- but that isn\u0027t used much and the MaterialDesignController API is really clunky and hard to use in tests -- I think we can get rid of it once --enable-features\u003dTouchableChrome is launched -- it will be super confusing trying to cater for both).",
