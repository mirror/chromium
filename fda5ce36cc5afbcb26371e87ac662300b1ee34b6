      "message": "Can this be a base::Feature rather than a switch? I\u0027d suggest putting it in ui/base/ui_base_features.h, like kSecondaryUiMd.\n\nThey can be used on the command line with --enable-features\u003d[NameOfFeature], can be enabled or disabled by Finch easily, and can also be easily added to chrome://flags which we may want to do for ease of UX/QA testing later down the line. Switches can do all of the above, but are a bit more unwieldly to work with, and base::Feature is the canonical way to add feature flags now. :)",
