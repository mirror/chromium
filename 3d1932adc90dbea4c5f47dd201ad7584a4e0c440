      "message": "I don\u0027t think it can be null or empty - we checked that CopyFromSurface returned READBACK_SUCCESS, I\u0027m assuming we can trust that.\nI actually had a DCHECK here in a previous version, but then decided that there\u0027s really no point to it - CalculateBoringScore will handle that just fine. (It returns 1, which even happens to be the default value of .boring_score.)\n\nI don\u0027t know why the check was there in the first place. Given the state this code was in, I\u0027m not convinced there ever was a reason :D",
