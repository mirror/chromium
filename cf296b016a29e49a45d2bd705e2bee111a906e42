      "message": "This looks like it would be wrong on high-DPI devices, because |point| is already in DIPs and line 1646 below tries to convert it to DIPs again.\n\nA better place to fix this might be in DelegatedFrameHost::SurfaceIdAtPoint(). If the hit test fails to find a Surface, it already does return the original point (untransformed, because we have no transform). If that method is returning early because the top-level DFH doesn\u0027t yet have a Surface, then we can just move the line \"*transformed_point \u003d point;\" up to the top of that method before the early return.\n\nThat has the advantage of also fixing the problem on Mac.",
