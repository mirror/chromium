This allows ServiceWorkerRegistration objects in different execution contexts to be different, even if they represent the same registration entity (registration_id is equal). They must be different since they should have different prototypes.\"\n\n(In reprospect, I think handle_id could have just been provider_id... but anyway these should all go away eventually.)",
