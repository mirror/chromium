You shouldn\u0027t need all the IPC support stuff, just a single call to mojo::edk::Init() per process.\n\nThe IPC stuff is only necessary if you actually need multiprocess support.\n\nPlease see what I did in my own CL here: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/818282/10/media/capture/video/video_capture_device_client_unittest.cc",

      "message": "Hmm, I think I did something similar in my original commit, but it is causing memory leaks, probably it is because mojo::edk::Init is called for each test in my original commit instead of only once per process.\n\nAgreed this is overkill for my use case. Will try update using your approach. Thanks,",
