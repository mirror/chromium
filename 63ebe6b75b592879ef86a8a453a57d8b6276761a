      "message": "Perhaps expand on this a little, so that if these kills happen in practice, it\u0027s easier for someone to figure out what happened?  I.e., error pages used by ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT are unique because chrome-error:// is a scheme that requires a unique origin.  (And maybe also something about the \"data:,\" error pages from XFO blocks, if we end up also using them below.)",

      "message": "I wonder if we should also consider ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE as a blocked navigation?  This is what XFO blocks use in AncestorThrottle.\n\nOTOH, maybe not, or at least the CanCommitURL check below shouldn\u0027t use it, since  NavigationRequest::OnRequestFailed leaves the error page in-process in that case.  This kind of makes sense - the policy that blocked the frame load came in the response headers (and not from the frame owner), so the frame might reload successfully if the policy changes later.",
