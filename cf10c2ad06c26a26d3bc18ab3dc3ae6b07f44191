The frame_id may not be needed either provided we vend instances that are framespecific, we also have to vend instances for WorkerNavigator.storage (sans frame_id i think).",

      "message": "Ken is working on improving how we associate pipes to script contexts but for now the answer is that |render_frame_id| is unnecessary and we can vend connections to this service that are associated with a RenderFrameHost or one where that pointer is null which would correspond to a WorkerNavigator. When the RenderFrameHost pointer is available we should check (and mojo::ReportBadMessage) if |origin_url| is equal to RenderFrameHost::GetLastCommittedURL().",
