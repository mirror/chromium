      "message": "The change of adding the callback to FirstMeaningfulPaintDetector.h that takes a PaintEvent creates a cyclic dependency of nested enum classes between FirstMeaningfulPaintDetector.h and PaintTiming.h. PaintTiming.h includes FirstMeaningfulPaintDetector.h for enum HadUserInput, and FirstMeaningfulPaintDetector.h includes PaintTiming.h for PaintEvent. I don\u0027t think I can forward declare my way out of that?\n\nI didn\u0027t want to factor it out, but couldn\u0027t seem to get around it. I\u0027m open to suggestions on a better way :)",
