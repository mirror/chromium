It seems ES (2.0, 3.0, 3.1) does not require Gen before Bind, but newer GL (compatibility and core) does require Gen before Bind.\n\nIf we add a DCHECK somewhere, making sure this workaround is only applied to non-ANGLE ES backend, then maybe it\u0027s OK to remove the Gen and simplify the logic of the workaround.",

      "message": "Thanks Mo for checking this.\n\nJohn: I tested removing the Gen call and the re-attachment code below and it does seem to work both for the trivial test case in http://crbug.com/696126 as well as Kai\u0027s new conformance test from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL/pull/2407 .\n\nHowever, I\u0027d like to leave in the Gen call, and the tracking of the framebuffer_attachment_points_ per renderbuffer, in case we need to apply this workaround on desktop GL or ever need these back-pointers for some other driver bug workaround. Is this OK with you?",
