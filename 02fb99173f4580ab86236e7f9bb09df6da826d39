      "message": "For downloads, the files used to create these bitmaps are already on device so we\u0027re not incurring extra overhead by skipping caching. I think it\u0027s possible that for other clients these are bitmaps that need to be fetched from a URL, and eliminating caching may incur additional data usage as the user scrolls.\n\nWhat if we save low-res bitmaps instead? The cache size should already be tuned to the available device memory.\n\n\nOrthogonally, it\u0027s probably time to move ThumbnailProviderImpl.java to the widgets/ package since it\u0027s being used for things other than downloads.",
