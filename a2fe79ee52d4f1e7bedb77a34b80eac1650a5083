The remote rendering size could be entirely different height and width (and overall resolution) than what is available locally.  I may be misunderstanding your question though...\n\nWe could maybe use a transform instead of the size here, but a straight scale factor doesn\u0027t sound like it would work to me.",

But I that might only affect layer-backed NSViews (we use layer-hosting NSViews for WebContents).\n\nI suspect you actually need to change the contents gravity on the layer like we discussed over email. But setting this property on the NSView could be a way to communicate to AcceleratedWidgetMac what contentsGravity it should be using in GotIOSurfaceFrame()",
