      "message": "This converts from const char* to StringPiece, which is unfortunate because the code which calls this function just did the reverse conversion. The conversion is cheap, but not free. We should use StringPiece here as well.

In practice in this case they are always NUL-terminated but we should enforce that with DCHECKs.
