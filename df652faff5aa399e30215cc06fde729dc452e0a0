      "message": "This solution is flaky and will incorrect metrics.\n\nExample:\n(1) Service starts up and adapter is not present.\n(2) Timer set for 2 seconds.\n(3) Adapter becomes present, and state is ENABLED. ENABLED is logged to metrics.\n(4) Timer fires, and state is still ENABLED. ENABLED is logged a second time.\n\nThis double logging can occur with other states besides ENABLED as well.\n\nThe correct thing to do is:\n(1) When we first encounter this situation, set a timer like you have already done.\n(2) When the timer fires, check to see if nothing has changed. If the state is still \"Bluetooth not present\" and there have been no state changes since then, then we can assume that this is an actual error and we should log to analytics. If the state has changed since the timer was set, we know it was a false positive and should not be logged.",
