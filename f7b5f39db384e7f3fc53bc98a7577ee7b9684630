      "message": "This is reached on un-mirroring when ash (1) notifies Mus that mirroring has ended, the mirror made a full-fledged display with a new root and then (2) destroys the old root window used for mirroring (it\u0027s no longer the root for that display).\n\nAgain, I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s a better way to go about this; maybe we need a more thoughtful ash-\u003emus synchronization/control, as DisplaySynchronizer seems to plumb through every change, perhaps with a bad ordering of window/display changes. Or maybe we need to rethink the way that root windows control displays and vice versa? Or a workaround like this might be appropriate...",
