      "message": "this will effectively double the bandwidth requirement when night mode is on. there\u0027s no need for that and it will result in a huge performance degradation on bandwidth limited devices. also, it prevents us from adding hw support. This needs to be done as a quad property to be efficient.",

      "message": "it doesn\u0027t make sense to use a separate color matrix for this. we should integrate with the existing color matrix if possible. if that\u0027s hard then using a full matrix here is overkill as only two values in that matrix will ever be set.",
