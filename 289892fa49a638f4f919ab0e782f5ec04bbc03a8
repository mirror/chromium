      "message": "Why not let the caller of the ThumbnailProvider say whether they should be cached? Would this change much for a single instance? For example downloads home wants the cache but Zine probably wouldn\u0027t use it because the thumbnails will change a more frequently. (or maybe we should so that we can discard them from the memory more aggressively... +bauerb@ thoughts?)",

I would be tempted to keep the current caching strategy, if only because download suggestions are going to go away with CH anyway.",
