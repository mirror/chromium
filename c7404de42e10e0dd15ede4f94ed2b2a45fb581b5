Trybots are green FWIW (the redness of mac_chromium_rel_ng and purpleness of win_chromium_x64_rel_ng are unrelated).  Looking at the body of the RendererBlinkPlatformImpl\u0027s constructor, it doesn\u0027t seem to do much, so earlier construction seems fine.\n\nBTW: Before this CL, we would miss field trial activation that should be triggered by:\n\n    void SetRuntimeFeaturesDefaultsAndUpdateFromArgs(\n      ...\n      const std::string webfonts_intervention_v2_group_name \u003d\n          base::FieldTrialList::FindFullName(\"WebFontsInterventionV2\");\n\n(without the ordering here it hits the DCHECK described in https://crbug.com/740726#c6).",
