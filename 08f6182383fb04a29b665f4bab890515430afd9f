E.g., if you see 100 users emitting to this histogram in next week\u0027s dev channel, how will you tell if that\u0027s a lot or a little?\n\nYou should probably either revise the histogram (to include the baseline: number of times this area of code is executed and no VR API is found) or at least revise the histogram description to describe what other histogram or user action/count you\u0027ll use to compare this number with.",
