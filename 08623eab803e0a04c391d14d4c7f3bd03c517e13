      "message": "When talking to battre@ yesterday, he suggested to also support localized Play names by providing the appropriate locale. While the Affiliation API supports setting a locale (https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/password_manager/core/browser/android_affiliation/affiliation_api.proto?l\u003d32), I actually don\u0027t know how to get hold of that information from within //components. The only API I could find is |GetApplicationLocale()|, however this is bound to the |g_browser_process| global variable and only available within //chrome. Do you happen to know how to solve this issue?",
