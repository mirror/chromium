I see the world where VR either replaces the presenters in the ModalDialogManager or replaces the Manager itself at the activity level.\n\nThe main thing would then be changing the PermissionDialogController to use the ModalDialogManager/ModalDialogView instead of using the AlertDialog at all.\n\nI guess my initial question is whether you see this as the desired long term solution as well?",

      "message": "Chrome supports mutli-window, so it\u0027s odd to have a stateful static like this (especially in a dialog class that could potentially be shown two at a time I believe in multiwindow, you can also stack dialogs on top of each other in non-multi-window).  I know this is used for VR only, which won\u0027t support multi-window, but this seems somewhat dangerous to me.",
