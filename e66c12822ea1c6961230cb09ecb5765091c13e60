Or maybe turn this into a loop over a vector like\n\n  std::vector\u003cBubbleIconView*\u003e icons \u003d {manage_passwords_icon_view_,\n                                        saved_credit_card_icon_view_,\n                                        translate_icon_view_};\n\nIt would be nice if we had a way to make sure this stayed in the same order as the icons in the UI, or is that not a goal?\n\nAs far as ShouldViewWithBubbleTriggerAccessibilityFocus, that should either be a file local static or a lambda within this function; there\u0027s no need to make it a member function. In fact if you use the loop mentioned above you can just inline the fn body.",
