      "message": "LOL, I added these tests mid-2016. They\u0027re explicitly testing the cull rect to make sure they are the right size, but since we\u0027re removing the cull rect they\u0027re not really relevant any more so I think we could just remove them.\n\nIt could be worth adding unit tests for painting with MockPaintCanvas but we aren\u0027t doing that currently anywhere and we do have existing coverage of painting with layout tests. So doing so seems like a separate P3 task we should do for both SVG and non-SVG InlineTextBoxPainter if we do want to further use of MockPaintCanvas for that.",
