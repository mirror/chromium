      "message": "These states are unobservable, and while that fits with the current use (stability metrics) it might be useful to expose them to the new observers. !GetMinidumpPath happens not just as an error condition, but also when minidump generation is disabled.\n\nSidebar: does this mean that the UMA stats collected below are underestimating the true crash rate by the fraction of executions for which breakpad crash dumping is disabled? Chrome generates minidumps all the time and then uploads a fraction of them, so I presume this doesn\u0027t have an effect on Chrome. If anyone does something about this TODO - https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/app/chrome_crash_reporter_client.cc?rcl\u003d07493032b5cf9f46de1d43087be1d3cdad6f1bb8\u0026l\u003d120 - then that won\u0027t be the case.\n\nWebView on the other hand disables crash dump generation for a fraction (99%) of runs. So WebView\u0027s stats are presumably currently very skewed.",
