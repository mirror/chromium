I would expect the default constructor for Origin to be almost free, and I might use it in the code as a placeholder to assign to later, etc.",

      "message": "Origins are immutable objects, aren\u0027t they? I don\u0027t see any way to create one and then assign host, port, etc afterwards.\n\nMaybe the constructor should be made private, and we should instead have Origin::Create(...) and Origin::CreateUnique(), with the understanding that CreateUnique is more expensive than a simple default initialization?",

      "message": "We do want it to be a very high chance of not colliding (even cross-process), and base::UnguessableToken is the standard way to do that. Do we consider base::RandBytes() to be expensive? I would have hoped that it\u0027s not too expensive (though it\u0027s worth noting that we do have more overhead than needed today, since we don\u0027t buffer any random data and have to read from the FD for each request of random bytes on Mac/Linux).\n\nIf we wanted to be really clever, I suppose we could delay initialization of the unguessable token to when it\u0027s read (for copies or for IPC serialization)?",

I would expect this to match the SchemeHostPort definition for how we expect these to be passed.\n\nFun: basically all schemes and many hosts on 64-bit platforms are short enough to fit in the short string optimization so passing by copy like this and moving would be worse than passing as StringPiece. If that\u0027s our rationale, we should change SchemeHostPort too.",
