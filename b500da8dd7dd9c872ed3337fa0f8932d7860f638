      "message": "Notable? change here is that we make a sync token for each texture, instead of doing it in OrderingBarrier() once. Before we were making a single sync token in ResourceProvider at the time of sending to parent, I believe.\n\nI should probably resolve that before landing, though if we move this to the worker thread then we\u0027ll make a sync token per resource there? Would you rather me put my time on that?",
