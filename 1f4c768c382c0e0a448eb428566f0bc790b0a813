      "message": "Can you do this when computing screen_to_buffer_transform_ instead? ie. in the ctor. We currently assume that the view will only show for a short amount of time so it should be fine to take this into account at that time just like we take the transform into account at that time. It would be more consistent that way.",

      "message": "It seems like drawing on the canvas in UpdateBuffer is expected to be in DIP...so I can\u0027t simply change screen_to_buffer_transform_ everywhere or else I\u0027ll be doing conversions in UpdateBuffers which just shifts the complexity elsewhere. WDYT? I think this is reasonable as is given that?",
