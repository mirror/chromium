      "message": "this feels like such a weird interface to me. i think it\u0027d make more sense if FileDescriptorWatcher didn\u0027t exist, and you just passed a delegate when you want to watch something.\n\nlooking at the implementation, there\u0027s also a requirement that a given FileDescriptorWatcher can only be used to watch a single FD. it looks like FileDescriptorWatchers are almost always created using ::WatchReadable or ::WatchWritable, but there are a few places (including mojo/edk/system/channel_posix.cc) where they\u0027re constructed directly.\n\nbut in any case, i salute your efforts to improve this comment!\n\nwhat about changing the \"If an error occurs ...\" sentence to end with something like \"..., |controller| will stop watching any previously-registered events.\"?",

      "message": "I am not trying to make sense of the interface.  There are too many objects involved.  I figure it makes sense in a multi-platform context and I don\u0027t need to know why.\n\nSo the comment is not only incomplete but also wrong?  Agh.\n\nRegarding your proposed change, I think the current comment is more useful.  \"Aborting events\" is stronger than \"stopping watching them\", and the former implies the latter, but the opposite is less clear.\n\nI also object to \"events\", it\u0027s more like \"conditions\" since if \"persistent\" is true, you\u0027re not attaching specific events to the controller.  But then again I was only trying to fix the most blatant problems.\n\nSigh.",
