      "message": "this feels like such a weird interface to me. i think it\u0027d make more sense if FileDescriptorWatcher didn\u0027t exist, and you just passed a delegate when you want to watch something.\n\nlooking at the implementation, there\u0027s also a requirement that a given FileDescriptorWatcher can only be used to watch a single FD. it looks like FileDescriptorWatchers are almost always created using ::WatchReadable or ::WatchWritable, but there are a few places (including mojo/edk/system/channel_posix.cc) where they\u0027re constructed directly.\n\nbut in any case, i salute your efforts to improve this comment!\n\nwhat about changing the \"If an error occurs ...\" sentence to end with something like \"..., |controller| will stop watching any previously-registered events.\"?",
