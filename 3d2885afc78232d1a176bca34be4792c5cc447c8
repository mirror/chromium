      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is a good idea.\n\nCan you instead introduce a virtual LayerOwner::OnLayerCreated(), which gets called from LayerOwner::RecreateLayer() instead? It is possible to install a different LayerOwnerDelegate from outside, and even when that happens, we would want to re-allocate the local-surface-id as appropriate. So doing this through the delegate interface can break and go undetected. Doing this through LayerOwner api is safer.",

      "message": "We\u0027ll have two ways for doing the same thing - OnLayerCreated and OnLayerRecreated in the delegate. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s right.\n\n\nIf you\u0027re concerned about the delegate being reassigned, how about passing the delegate in LayerOwner constructor? It\u0027ll make it immutable.\n\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "LayerOwnerDelegate is used in ContentsWebView for a thing which is not delegating. ContentsWebView is simply performing some extra logic, which is related to some web view specific animations. It\u0027s not delegation. It\u0027s an observer pattern.\n\nHowever, resetting local surface id *is* a delegation, as it\u0027s required to make LayerOwner::RecreateLayer work properly.\n\nSo, ideally we should have both - an observer and a delegate, though it would be an overkill. So, I\u0027d suggest to simply change the delegate into an observer. WDYT?",
