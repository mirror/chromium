      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is a good idea.\n\nCan you instead introduce a virtual LayerOwner::OnLayerCreated(), which gets called from LayerOwner::RecreateLayer() instead? It is possible to install a different LayerOwnerDelegate from outside, and even when that happens, we would want to re-allocate the local-surface-id as appropriate. So doing this through the delegate interface can break and go undetected. Doing this through LayerOwner api is safer.",

I don\u0027t think it\u0027s right.\n\n\nIf you\u0027re concerned about the delegate being reassigned, how about passing the delegate in LayerOwner constructor? It\u0027ll make it immutable.\n\n\nWDYT?",
