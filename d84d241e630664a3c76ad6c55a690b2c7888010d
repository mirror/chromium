      "message": "what will happen to the old component? Will there eventually be components that can run together?\nI wonder if this should be called something like setAnalyticsService(options, callback) - I think naming would do better job implying that the components are not expected to run concurrently (assuming this is correct assumption).\n\nDo we need a method to unload a component, in case you plan to eventually extend this to support more than one component.\n\nI\u0027m also little concerned that \"component\" is not very well defined in this context (e.g. component of what is the service, it sounds more like this method is intended to load components of the analytics service).",
