Will there eventually be components that can run together?\nI wonder if this should be called something like setAnalyticsService(options, callback) - I think naming would do better job implying that the components are not expected to run concurrently (assuming this is correct assumption).\n\nDo we need a method to unload a component, in case you plan to eventually extend this to support more than one component.\n\nI\u0027m also little concerned that \"component\" is not very well defined in this context (e.g. component of what is the service, it sounds more like this method is intended to load components of the analytics service).",

We are actively working on go/mpp-v2 and after discussing with rkc@ it seems that creating a new parallel API (while this one still serves its purpose until deprecation) gives us a bit more flexibility. For that reason, I\u0027m not sure we need to think too deeply about how this API will support multiple components, concurrent components, etc whereas for the new API we will be sure to be meticulous.",
