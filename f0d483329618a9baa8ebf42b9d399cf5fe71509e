      "message": "I was working on a change that instead disabled InfoBars, saving any that were present when disabled and any that were meant to be shown when disabled. Then when reenabled the InfoBars were all shown again. It ended up getting a bit complicated and I figured InfoBars were a \u0027best effort\u0027 type of thing - they\u0027re good to show the user but if some user triggered action dismisses them then no loss. If this isn\u0027t the case I can reimplement the more heavyweight solution.",

      "message": "Could we just do the same thing we do for interstitial pages (set visibility to false) or detach the container from the window? The infobar container has a method \"setIsObscuredByOtherView\" that does the former. It might be worth recycling this concept for this case.\n\nThe reason I\u0027m against \"removeAllInfoBars\" is that it exposes an extremely powerful method publicly. Further, \u0027remove\u0027 only appears to remove the visible part of the infobar, the native side would still be around (at least until navigation or the tab closes).",
