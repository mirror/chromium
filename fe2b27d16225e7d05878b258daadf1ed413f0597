If so, could you use one of Python\u0027s existing binary search methods? e.g. https://docs.python.org/2/library/bisect.html\n\nIf not, since the list is not very long, it\u0027s probably easier to maintain (and might be faster) to just linear search through the array.",

      "message": "I understand that this algorithm re-evaluates all the rare-non-inherited fields. From the json perspective, it might be a bit confusing, since when I specify a field to be rare-non-inherited, I don\u0027t expect it to be put into another group. I was wondering if in a future patch, we might find a way to resolve this confusion e.g. have something like \"field_group: auto\" or something to say that we want to find the best grouping.\n\nIt\u0027s fine as it is, just a suggestion for the future.",
