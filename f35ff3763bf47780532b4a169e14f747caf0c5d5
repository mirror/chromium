We get:\n\nc \u003d pos \u003d TABLE@0\nboundary \u003d TABLE\nstart \u003d OUTPUT@1 as ParentAnchoredEquivalent() moves the position out from table\nsearch_start \u003d OUTPUT@AfterAnchor as OUTPUT is editing-ignored content\nsearch_end \u003d TABLE@AfterChildren\n\nI\u0027m not sure which one of them is wrong exactly. However, |search_start| doesn\u0027t seem very reasonable since it\u0027s out of |boundary|\n\n\u003e \n\u003e It seems strange that EditingPositionOf() is called with anchor node and\n\u003e offset in container node. It should be container node + offset in container\n\u003e node.\n\nThis part seems OK, since |start| is offset in anchor as it\u0027s created by ParentAnchoredEquivalent().\n\n\u003e \n\u003e However, in this case, |start| may be TABLE@0.",
