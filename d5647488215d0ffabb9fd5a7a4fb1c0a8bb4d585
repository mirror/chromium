      "message": "I\u0027m struggling to understand this function. I\u0027ve reread it a handful of times. The comment describes it as doing short copies until it can do chunk-sized copies. (However, it works on loadchunk/storechunk, which are chunk-sized.)\n\nAdditionally, it seems to only be called from here:\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/627098/5/third_party/zlib/contrib/arm/inffast.c#231\nThe comment there seems to match the comment here. I believe my understanding of the small-copies-before-using-chunk-sized-copies matches these.\n\nBut the way this operates hasn\u0027t become clear to me yet.\n* We\u0027re copying |from| -\u003e |out|.\n* |from| is calculated by moving backwards from |out| by the magnitude |dist|. Since |dist| is unsigned, |from| must come first in the absolute memory address. This seems odd.\n* |from| is never updated, so we\u0027re copying the same values multiple times. (loadchunk could be moved out of the loop)\n* Since we increment |out| by an unsigned value, we\u0027re working from the front of the buffer to the back.\n\nAn example run-through might be shifting a buffer to the right 3 bytes\n* Suppose our buffer is filled with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\n* |dist| is 3\n* We load the first chunk from the buffer and write it to the shifted-right location (clobbering 3 bytes)\n* |out| +\u003d 3, so |out| is now 6 bytes from the beginning of the buffer\n* We double |dist| so it is now 6.\n* 6 \u003c the chunk size of 16 so we loop again\n* We load the first chunk again (didn\u0027t move |from|) and write it to the shifted-right location, which is now the front of the buffer + 6\n* At this point, we have clobbered 6 bytes and our buffer looks like 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...\n* It continues looping, doubling |dist| each time. So the next doubling causes |dist| to become 12, the copy happens, and when |dist| doubles again it becomes 24 and is greater than the chunk size so it doesn\u0027t loop further.\n\n\nMaybe I\u0027m misreading something?",

      "message": "Well, that\u0027s how DEFLATE works: more like memcpy than memmove.\n\nA string of 20 consecutive \u0027A\u0027 bytes can be encoded as a literal \u0027A\u0027 followed by a \u003clength\u003d19, distance\u003d1\u003e code. A string of 7 consecutive \"ABC\"s can be encoded as the three literals \u0027A\u0027, \u0027B\u0027, \u0027C\u0027 followed by a \u003clength\u003d18, distance\u003d3\u003e code. When decoding, after the first three literals our buffer is \"ABC_etc\", where the underscore denotes the out pointer. Iterations of this loop expand that to \"ABCABC_etc\" (and now len\u003d15, dist\u003d6), \"ABCABCABCABC_etc\" (and now len\u003d9, dist\u003d12, so the loop ends).\n\nThere\u0027s a comment \"The main part of this loop is a simple copy of eight bytes...\" about a similar technique in the Go Snappy port at https://github.com/golang/snappy/blob/master/decode_amd64.s#L367\n\nThat comment was originally in the C++ Snappy implementation but the C++ Snappy code appears to have refactored itself since then.",

This is usually the first thing anyone does when they approach an VLC coder, but I separated it out into another patch and then began a more substantial refactor of the code handling (fewer switches for fewer branch mispredicts), but then backed off because it was conflicting with pre-existing and on-going work in zlib-ng.",

      "message": "BTW, to express a legal unaligned load in C you can\u0027t necessarily just cast the pointer, but you can write bytes loads and rely on the compiler to fuse them provided it\u0027s a clear machine word load (eg., src[0]+src[1]*256u+...).  All the big endian targets I tried with that produce special endian-reversing and alignment-fixing loads and these are probably still faster than the original code despite the extra work.\n\nThis breaks down a little in some compilers if you scale it down to 16-bit, but works in principle on 32-bit targets (and provides a performance gain on \u003e\u003d armv7).  You just have to watch the compiler closely to make sure it doesn\u0027t screw up.",
