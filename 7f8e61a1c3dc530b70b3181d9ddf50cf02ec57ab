We\u0027re fetching the contents of URL and putting them in a data URL, and then loading the data URL into the \u003cwebview\u003e  That means we\u0027ll never try to load chrome://terms into the \u003cwebview\u003e, which eliminates some questions about how it will behave.\n\nCan you update the comment on this function to clarify this is intentional?",
