      "message": "Can you add a few unittests for these functions?\nAlso, is a case like\n\n\"begin op1 op2 begin op3 op4 end op5 op6 end\" possible? (begin \u003d StartPaint here)\nIf this results in 2 visual rects (for each of the begins), then what are the starts?\n0 for the first one, 3 for the second one? But then what about op5 and op6 visual rects, are those a part of the first visual rect with start\u003d0? They are not captured in the [0, 3) range\n\nOr is this 4 visual rects with paired begin/ends sharing the same visual rect but different start? The confusion I have is that I only see one current_range_start_ \u003d something_non_zero, which in StartPaint. \n\nI\u0027m not sure if what I\u0027m asking makes sense... so maybe when you add comments and a few tests here, it will be more clear to me.",
