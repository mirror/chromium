      "message": "I like this suggestion, thank you - but the code below the else needs a reference to the CompositorFrame and there doesn\u0027t seem to be a clean way to implement this as a hit_test_data_provider.  Instead I\u0027ve moved the code into a separate function that I *think* cleans up the implementation a bit and makes it clear in the next patch.  Please let me know what you think.",
