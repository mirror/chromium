      "message": "Please explain more how this benefits users.\nMy first impression is to say not lgtm, but I may be misunderstanding (or maybe there\u0027s a larger picture I\u0027m not seeing yet). I did try looking at the slides mentioned in the bug mentioned in this CL, but I still came away seeing this as not beneficial to users (again, I may have missed something and may have the wrong impression). I\u0027m open to hearing more about this.\n\nHere\u0027s an answer that would work for me (I\u0027m trying to help):\n\n    The equivalent for \"Blocked\" by default is to \n    mute the OS sound; which will be respected in \n    Chrome. So there\u0027s no need to have \"two levels \n    of mute\" (the OS and the browser).\n\nIs that the idea?",
