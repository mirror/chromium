      "message": "Fair point. I was just thinking about DevTools because almost all of our tests are text-based :)\n\nIt already prints out the failure type so I think we\u0027re OK here. I think we can make this better later? (e.g. for pixel-based tests, give it the correct diff link). For now, I\u0027ll only print the link to pretty diff if it\u0027s a text mismatch.\n\nExample output:\n[1/1] http/tests/devtools/unit/list-model.js failed unexpectedly (test timed out)\nFinished running tests\nInteractive watch mode: (q)uit (r)etry",
