      "message": "I think the vr package makes sense here, but I think I\u0027d still ask whether you think this is a generic enough name long term.  Will there ever be other VR entry points that should be funneled through this activity?  Ideally, this will ever only be the one VR activity exposed in the manifest and I want to make sure we\u0027re giving ourselves enough growing room.",

      "message": "I think this should actually be the contents of isStartedUpCorrectly.  If this isn\u0027t a trust daydream intent, we should remove chrome.  We shouldn\u0027t allow this to be an entry point for anything but that.\n\nAlso, I do think we should now change AsyncInitializationActivity#onCreateInternal to call sanitizeIntent.  We could potentially add a function called something like validateIntent that only does this work in this activity (would simply return the passed in intent or do nothing if we don\u0027t mutate the intent), but I think we can first add it to the main entry point and just keep it consistent without this indirection.\n\nWe may long term want to add more machinery around validating stuff only for exported intents, but that is probably outside the scope of this.  I worry that if we don\u0027t at least call that, then we\u0027ll start getting crash reports for bad intents passed to us.",
