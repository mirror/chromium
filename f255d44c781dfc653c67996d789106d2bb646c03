      "message": "Currently, we have to scan the idle stack every time we call GetWork() (see calls to AddToIdleWorkersStack() and RemoveFromIdleWorkersStack()). Once the number of workers can grow dynamically, this might become a problem.\n\nWith this CL, there are 2 scenarios in which GetWork() can be called:\n- |is_active_| is true, worker is not on the idle stack -\u003e Check if there is work. If yes, return it. If no, add worker on top of the idle stack, set |is_active_| to false and return nullptr.\n- |is_active_| is false, worker is on the idle stack, sleep timeout just expired -\u003e Cleanup immediately, without checking for work.\n\nNote that GetWork() never scans the idle stack, except when cleaning up a worker. Are you saying that we could achieve that without |is_active_|, by using only |last_get_work_returned_nullptr_|?",
