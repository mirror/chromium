      "message": "It cannot happen in real app, because [CRWebController setWebUsageEnabled:NO] will call [self resetContainerView], that will destroy the native content. Problem is that WKWebView may live a little longer than OverscrollActionsController because of ARC deallocation ordering.\n\nA symmetric fix could be to not destroy the _staticHTMLViewController later, but that would be against documentation of |setWebUsageEnabled:| that is\n\n\"Whether or not a UIWebView is allowed to exist in this CRWWebController\"\nSo my understanding is that setting it to NO must destroy the WKWebView.",
