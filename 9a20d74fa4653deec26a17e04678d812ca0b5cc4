I special-cased \"image/svg+xml\" and added a unit test.  AFAIK this is the only mime type that needs special casing to avoid confusing it with JSON and/or XML (based on trying to Google for image types supported by Google and by skimming through the list of \"+xml\" mime types on https://www.freeformatter.com/mime-types-list.html).",
