So it seems it should still stay in storage/ ?\n\nMy plan was that, once DataElement is simplified so that it\u0027s just string/file/data pipe, I would move it to services/network. I guess I could move the interface from blink to services/network then. It just seemed a little confusing to have interfaces in blink/ that blink/ doesn\u0027t use.",
