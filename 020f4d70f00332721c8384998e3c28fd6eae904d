      "message": "I think these changes in SurfaceAggregator can be simplified. The basic idea is to get primary_rect from the surface_quad, and try to fill that rect with a compositor frame. The compositor frame can be either primary or fallback, and if the size doesn\u0027t match, checkerboard. This won\u0027t need creating a temporary quad.\n\nShould be able to achieve this by factoring out the HandleSurfaceQuad function from around getting active frame from surface.",
