      "message": "I would prefer if this was a more general function, like GetAdditionalNavigationRequestHeaders. We would provide there the opportunity for the content/ embedder to add additional request headers, without specifying which kind of request headers it\u0027s adding. In particular, I don\u0027t think it makes sense for content/ to know about ClientHint headers.\n\nAlso, why not have the function return the headers explicitly, instead of modifying a pointer?",
