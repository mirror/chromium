We can discuss it and decide later, current implementation looks good.\n\n1) index.html file shows per directory coverage, but also has a link at the top, something like \"Click here to see coverage report for all source files\" (needs a better phrasing I guess)\n\n2) index.html file shows per source file coverage, but has a link at the top, something like \"Click here to see per directory coverage\". I like this less than the 1st, as coverage per directory seems to be more useful in a general case\n\n3) index.html file has two links to different pages: to per directory coverage and to per file",
