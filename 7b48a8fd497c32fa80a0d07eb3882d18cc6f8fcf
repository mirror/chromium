My assumption was that GetExactBufferSize could be used in other areas, even though it\u0027s only used for WA today, and returns a buffer size that the caller knows is supported by the platform audio layer. Then Web Audio may choose to increase this value even further for its own purposes but that this is a separate thing. This would also allow reporting both values up to Web Audio later, i.e. the current buffer size in use by the sink as well as the underlying hardware buffer size. I\u0027m certainly open to putting everything in GetExactBufferSize though if you think that\u0027s best!",
