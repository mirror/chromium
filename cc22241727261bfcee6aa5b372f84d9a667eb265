Unit tests are great for 2 things: preventing regressions during the refactoring and validating the design. Tests which test private implementation or build backdoors are not helpful with those 2 things.\n\n\"Tab\" unit tests are good example of tests which never catch any regressions, failed to validate Tab design and constantly require maintenance during the refactoring.",
