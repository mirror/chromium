      "message": "I find this to be a strange change. DidClearWindowObject was _the_ place to execute JS after commit, and now every client should be aware enough to do a PostTask? Perhaps it makes sense to fire DidClearWindowObject later?\n\nAlso note, that this code is moving: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/739746/4/third_party/WebKit/Source/controller/DevToolsFrontendImpl.cpp#96. Could you please wait a bit (that change has almost landed)? This also suggests that blink might have similar places which execute JS early - you might want to cover them as well.",
