      "message": "Is the save/restore balancing necessary here, especially since you\u0027re not iterating through custom indices. A PaintRecord is nice about balancing its saves (see https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/paint/paint_recorder.cc?type\u003dcs\u0026l\u003d29) so if you\u0027re going to iterate through the complete buffer, manually restoring shouldn\u0027t be required.\n\nInstead of adding the Frame stack to store all this state, may be an internal recursive function that takes a PaintOpBuffer iterator and reads the ctm from the state_canvas_ would suffice? Only the top level function needs to do the save/restore balancing manually.",
