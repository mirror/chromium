We can certainly update it to meet the needs.\n\nIf we\u0027re not going to use it for anything other than solid color analysis, then I can merge this with the solid color analyzer and devirtualize it.",

      "message": "We actually do more work in the AnalysisCanvas to handle savelayers more, but I think that\u0027s pretty useless work since we early out after 1 draw op anyway, so it really only catches cases where we have a save layer, since draw op, restore and nothing else.. I think that\u0027s pretty uncommon.",
