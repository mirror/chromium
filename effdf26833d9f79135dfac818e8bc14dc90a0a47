      "message": "There\u0027s no performance impact for preserveDrawingBuffer\u003dtrue in magic window mode, this only matters while presenting and when using the planned new render path where there\u0027s a per-frame destination buffer.\n\nI think collecting this data for any WebVR-capable canvas would also be a valid approach, though it might skew statistics if there\u0027s a site such as Sketchfab where maybe only a small fraction of users end up using WebVR presentation. I don\u0027t have a strong opinion either way. I expect usage to be low, and wouldn\u0027t be surprised if existing uses are unintentional.\n\nIf I read the code right, we\u0027re currently only recording actions for requestPresent, not for associating a canvas with WebVR for magic window mode. Since it\u0027s recording an action only when preserveDrawingBuffer\u003dtrue, we wouldn\u0027t be able to calculate a percentage of sites unless we record \u003dfalse also or record a separate action to use for the baseline number.",
