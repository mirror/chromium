Can you remind me where |picture_buffer_id| comes from for the protected output buffer path?\n\nPerhaps it\u0027d be useful to have a struct-level comment that documents the overall control flow for the non-protected and the protected path.\n\ni.e.\n\nFor protected playback, clients must first call Initialize(). Once that succeeds, clients should do \u003cx\u003e, \u003cy\u003e, and \u003cz\u003e. During decoding, a picture buffer is allocated by \u003csomething\u003e. The video decoder writes the decoded output into \u003csomething else\u003e and notifies the client to consume it with \u003cyet another thing\u003e.\n\nSomething like that?",
