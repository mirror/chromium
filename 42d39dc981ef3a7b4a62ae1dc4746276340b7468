See https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/renderer_host/media/audio_input_device_manager.cc?sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr\u003dCSs\u0026l\u003d87\n\nDo you have any advice here? Would reading the hardware parameters of the default output device be correct? Would it be the same for tab and system capture?\nIf there is a good way to read device capabilities, I can add the corresponding support in a follow up CL.",
