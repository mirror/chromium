      "message": "Having dealt with this for a few days in the AudioOutputDelegate test case, I would try to avoid using this construct going forward. It\u0027s hard to reason about and feels like magic in terms of what it\u0027s actually doing to solve a given crash.\n\nI think it\u0027d be clearer if the tests explicitly spun the loops they needed to instead with explanations of why.",

      "message": "I agree it\u0027s not very clean. The AudioOutputDelegate test could probably just be single-threaded. This test is a big larger though, I feel like what is posted to which thread and when is part of the implementation of the classes rather than being part of the specification, so the test should be robust to changes. Most threads should probably just be single-threaded though.",
