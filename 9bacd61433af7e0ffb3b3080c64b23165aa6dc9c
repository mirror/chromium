Its name should be changed, or maybe we should move its body to PreSandBoxInitialization() and delete it altogether if that still results in a valid code flow? At first sight it would, and the fact that PostSandBoxInitialization() is currently called from a static context further reinforces the feeling that this is the correct thing to do.",
