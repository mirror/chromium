Can we use this to fix the UMA? e.g. skip RecordHistogram [1] call to filter out suggested app, or pass it in to filter out inside RecordHistogram?\n\n[1]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/ui/app_list/search/search_util.cc?rcl\u003d20c46444e0b3199d11a47c560b8da615facbbd1d\u0026l\u003d16",

      "message": "Is DISPLAY_RECOMMENDATION a suggested app? It is used on SearchController::OpenResult to record search-related metrics so I assumed it was a type of search result.\n\nWe also record other search-related metrics whenever a suggested app is clicked at SearchController::OpenResult which should not be recorded.\n\nI created a new code path because we currently record histograms at many levels of the call stack that seem to be for Search Results, not suggested apps.",
