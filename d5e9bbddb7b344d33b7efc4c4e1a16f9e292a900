      "message": "confused at the claim the quad has an opaque rect when it\u0027s transparent. should it still occlude things? Can you leave a comment here and explain why? Maybe it should be OccludingTransparent in the function name or something, this should be very clear I think, as there\u0027s a lot going on.",

      "message": "Good point. Right now this is only used in overlay which is after occlusion, I don\u0027t think direct renderer looks at the occlusion rect of solid color quads.\n\nI am guessing that we want a transparent quad instead of remove the quad is we don\u0027t want to deal with the moving memory around. I could only keep the rect and sqs and set other rects to empty to show it\u0027s transparent?",
