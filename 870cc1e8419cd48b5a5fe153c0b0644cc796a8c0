      "message": "Nate \u0026 Kinuko:\nThis line has different behavior comparing with the old code path (see the link below): It is conservative and *not* skip SafeBrowsing checks if we cannot find |client|. Does it makes sense?\n\nFor example:\n- If a request is from a shared worker, it is not associated with a frame. In that case, I imagine we will get a null |client| but we should still enforce SafeBrowsing checks.\n\n- If a request continues to load even after the corresponding frame is gone (Kinuko: is that possible?), it might be possible that the frame has been removed at this point which results in null |client|.\n\nThe old code path currently skips SafeBrowsing check if the client is null:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/android_webview/browser/renderer_host/aw_resource_dispatcher_host_delegate.cc?rcl\u003dee5a883e7a082e1456108378340c8013b330588d\u0026l\u003d223\n\nIt seems problematic to me.\n\nDoes it make sense? Please let me know if I am wrong.",
