      "message": "I had to do this hack to allow supervision triggering to work in different sessions. \"user_context\" is the one holding information right after refresh token fetch, but \"user\" loads the user type from the disk on session restore. I\u0027m not sure why the user type is kept in different places, but I\u0027m going to study a better way to keep them in sync in the follow-up.",

It won\u0027t solve all the problems, but it looks like a good place to initialize AccountTrackerService. \n\nPS:\nWe cannot change User type here, because it\u0027s too late.\n\nWe need to create user_manager::User with correct account type from the very beginning.\n\nUnfortunately, current implementation completely ignores UserContext::user_type_ value, and this is what I am working now.",
