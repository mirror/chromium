After this call we end up reporting 12s of watch time for the no native controls; instead of what\u0027s calculated here, 30 - 12 \u003d\u003d 18; the time reported for controls on is 12s, so the 18s value here is correct. I\u0027m not sure exactly what\u0027s going wrong yet.",

As a result, the `bool record_native_controls \u003d has_native_controls \u0026\u0026 !is_controls_change_pending;` was bogus. Dropping this solved everything \\o/",
