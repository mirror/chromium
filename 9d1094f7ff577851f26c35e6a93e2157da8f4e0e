      "message": "The double use of \"pending\" is confusing (why would \"pending controller request\" not be pending?) but I don\u0027t have a better idea if you don\u0027t. My understanding is \"pending_controller_request\" refers to the fact that the Request is waiting to be sent in the Start message, and \"is_pending\" basically means the Request is non-null.\n\nI might just drop the \"pending_\" from the name.",
