      "message": "So this changes relevant things, I believe:\n\n1)  When passed a File, we do a seek instead of an open (But the consumer still had to call open at some point).  So the new path has an extra seek.  I\u0027m not too concerned with this, though we we are concerned about perf, we can combine seek + get info into a single post task, which would still theoretically be more expensive than the old behavior.  We could also get rid of the first seek, I suppose, and rely on it already being at the start of the file.  That makes me nervous - not concerned about attackers so much as bugs.  If we did that, though, we\u0027d have the same number of operations in the non-re-Init case.\n\n2)  When interrupted with an open file, we wait for the previous operation to complete.  This only happens on network errors when reusing sockets.  I think this is sufficiently obscure that we don\u0027t care.\n\n3)  When we complete and re-send a request (due to redirects), we do a seek instead of a close + open.  I think this is almost certainly a perf improvement, though I\u0027m not really too concerned about perf on sites that want us to upload the same data multiple times.\n\nThere may be some more minor things, like we keep the FileContext around on completion and destroy it later, but I consider those not really worth thinking about.\n\nSo, in summary, I\u0027m fine with any perf changes, even ignoring consumers.  If 1) is a problem, we can work around it, and 3) is likely an improvement, or at least neutral.  2) is the only perf regression we have no choice about.  We could also make perf more competitive in 2) and 3) by reusing the file info between retries.\n\n\n\nThat having been said, let\u0027s look at consumers.  This class itself is only used for HttpNetworkTransaction.  To the extent of my knowledge, that only leaves us Cronet and Chrome.\n\nWith Chrome, we\u0027re sandboxed on desktop, so there\u0027s really no choice, unless we want to push back on the sandbox.\n\nI don\u0027t think we want to have different usage patterns on Chrome for Android, since the consumer code is the same, and the changes would need to affect blob code as well.\n\nCronet on Android uses its own magic (Due to the file behavior, it reads the files in Java), so doesn\u0027t use this file.\n\nSo that leaves only iOS (Cronet and Chrome).  We could keep the old logic in an iOS specific class, but even if there were a benefit, I think the cases where it may make a difference are just too obscure to warrant iOS-only code.\n\nI suppose there may also be consumers of the C++ API on Android.",
