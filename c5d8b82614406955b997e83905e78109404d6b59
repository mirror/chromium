      "message": "Cool! Yeah, non bonding devices not connecting seems like a separate issue and if I remember correctly it was called out as one of the things the UWP API fixed.\n\nSo to confirm the follow is what happens:\n\n1. Device that supports pairing disconnects\n2. We enumerate devices\n3. Windows reconnects to the device in 1.\n\nBut for non-bonding devices 3. doesn\u0027t happen?\n\nI mainly want to know if Windows is always trying to reconnect to the device and that if the device is not connected when this function is called then we can assume Windows is not able to reconnect to the device and we should reject here.",

      "message": "A. That is my understanding from the docs (although admittedly, they aren\u0027t clear, and all I have is the reference in the UWP docs)\nB. That is my understanding from experience (it certainly seems to be the case given that I can crash the browser, bring it up and connect again)\nC. That is my understanding given that I don\u0027t see how it could be otherwise (how else could you reconnect?  The user would have to unpair/pair, which seems very odd.)\n\nHowever, I\u0027ve not actually simulated a device that actually disconnects itself.  Also, I haven\u0027t been able to connect our BLE peripheral simulator on Windows, because Android asks for a pairing key and Windows doesn\u0027t give me one (0000 and 1234 don\u0027t work), so I\u0027m not sure how I could conduct this test.",

You could try with some of our other devices e.g. the Mi Band or the BB-8.\n\nfwiw: I don\u0027t think we should delay this patch. Happy to land and change later if we find a device that changes our understanding of the API.",
