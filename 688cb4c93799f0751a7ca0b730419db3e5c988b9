      "message": "Maybe I\u0027ll make it a default, since I think this is a good value that shows a color without hiding too much of the text. If the user sets an alpha value we can use that instead.\n\nDigging into this further, I see that I\u0027ll need to change image_util.cc\u0027s ParseHexColorString function to take strings with RGBA format. I\u0027d like to do this separately as this change already has a lot of scope. Sound ok?",
