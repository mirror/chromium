It certainly makes sense for a genuine feature, but I wonder if you really think that this CL is for introducing a new feature as opposed to fixing a bug (given your findings in the bug). \nWell, this bug has been present for several years (blame should go to me) so that taking a couple of more releases to launch wouldn\u0027t make a big difference. \n\nOTOH, additional code/time overhead to take \u0027feature launch procedures\u0027 seems unnecessary for this particular issue. (and, I was hoping to hop on this CL to get rid of a local ICU patch for \u0027full-stop\u0027 handling). \n\nGiven that Jongdeok has already gone through a number of iterations to put this behind a flag, this CL may go ahead as it is.",

That finally answers my question a week ago why \u0027virtual\u0027 declaration was removed. :-) \n\nAs I wrote in another comment, I believe this is a bug fix rather than a \u0027new feature\u0027. As such, I\u0027d not put this behind a flag and take it through a feature launch process. Then, all of these would be moot. \n\nAnd, even if we want to go through a feature launch process, I\u0027m not sure if we\u0027re gaining much from not using virtual, but perhaps taking a precaution is not bad.
