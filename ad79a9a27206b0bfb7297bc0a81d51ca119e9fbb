They can\u0027t be run here because they don\u0027t use the mock; they call all the way down to the device layer and time out. (Unlike the way we return from authenticator_impl in makeCredential calls by giving an invalid algorithm, there isn\u0027t a way to return from authenticator_impl prior to reaching device/ for getAssertion calls.)",

      "message": "? We had a similar issue with create(), hence this comment:\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/775630/10/third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/http/tests/credentialmanager/credentialscontainer-create-iframe.html#22\n\nI double checked, and the first *two* tests use the mock and work fine. The comment I just referenced was for the third test, which definitely does not use the mock.\n\nAnyways, the test timeout seems to happen in 6 seconds. I could add an adjusted timeout to exit before then if we make the minimum really really short. But that might cause unintended problems when it comes to using BLE devices, no? What do you think?",
