They can\u0027t be run here because they don\u0027t use the mock; they call all the way down to the device layer and time out. (Unlike the way we return from authenticator_impl in makeCredential calls by giving an invalid algorithm, there isn\u0027t a way to return from authenticator_impl prior to reaching device/ for getAssertion calls.)",
