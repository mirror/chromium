      "message": "I would still rather have CountMatchingURLs so that strip_fragment can apply here.  We should find a code shape that allows the current behavior to remain without special-case behavior.  After all, this is a generic query object.  It will be much harder to convert this to SQL if we have a lot of subtle differences like this.",

      "message": "Done.\nI\u0027m not sure but I guess you meant to use CountMatchingUrls with a const false argument passed in for the original_url case.\nI totally agree to have a more unified way to organize the code. However I believe it needs some clarification from the team how the url comparison should be done in all case so that the whole piece of code can be refactored at once (maybe along with going forward with the SQL thing). But it can be a near future patch and this one will be focusing on keep the current behavior.",
