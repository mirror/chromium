      "message": "In most cases these 3 should always have valid values, unnecessary ::New()s happen at the only one exception in ServiceWorkerProviderHost::GetRegistrationComplete() when there is not registration found or the found registration is uninstalling. So, personally I feel we\u0027d better not to make them optional, to avoid any unintentional behaviors that somewhere may use null values by mistakes.  \nAlso, about ServiceWorkerRegistrationObjectHost.GetRegistration()\u0027s response, I\u0027m considering to pass a null ServiceWorkerRegistrationObjectInfoPtr in case that no registration has been found or the found one is uninstalling, together with a kNone |error| though. Thus we can remove those unnecessary ::New()s there, and also can remove \u0027?\u0027 at line43 of this file. WDYT? Thanks.",
