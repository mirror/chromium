      "message": "Shouldn\u0027t this be paint(foo), paint(error)? According to https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#layering the first image specified is closest to the user so even if \u0027geometry\u0027 was \u0027foo\u0027 and it was painted it would be covered by the green from \u0027error\u0027. Can you verify that the test fails if you remove the exception in the constructor?",

      "message": "My naming was terrible. The first registerPaint should be \u0027error\u0027, and the second one is \u0027geometry\u0027, then \"paint(error), paint(geometry)\" would make sense. This is done in the new patch. Also, I have verified that the test fails if I remove the exception in the constructor.",
