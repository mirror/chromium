It looks like we hide apps in AppsGridView [1]. We should probably put similar logic in AppsGridView::OnListItemAdded [2].\n\n[1]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/app_list/views/apps_grid_view.cc?rcl\u003d31363f832b6dcb9440d4f045a1c3c49aef7d9953\u0026l\u003d950\n[2]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/app_list/views/apps_grid_view.cc?rcl\u003d31363f832b6dcb9440d4f045a1c3c49aef7d9953\u0026l\u003d2531",
