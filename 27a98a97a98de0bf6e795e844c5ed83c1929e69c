      "message": "Suppose you have an existing WebGL or Canvas app -- something very big and complicated -- and you want to add WCG or HDR support to it. The easiest path is to use extended-sRGB half-float. We don\u0027t have this as part of the spec, but we should.\n\nIf the user is forced to use linear-scRGB, then they have to re-write their entire application (because writing gl_FragColor\u003dvec4(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1) will no longer match #808080, but rather, will match #373737).",
