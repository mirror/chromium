      "message": "FYI: This refactoring primarily aims to avoid weird code flows like this else statement, which relies on the fact that CUSTOM_TABS_UI_TYPE_MEDIA_VIEWER and CUSTOM_TABS_UI_TYPE_PAYMENT_REQUEST hide open in chrome and bookmark items, in order to skip initializing them.\n\nEngineer adding a new UI type might be tempted to add another else if {} here, which could cause issues if they for example didn\u0027t hide bookmark item and didn\u0027t refactor the rest.\n\nThe if statement with FirstRunStatus.getFirstRunFlowComplete() hiding things we already might have initialized is also a little dirty.\n\nWe might go even further and add methods e.g. isOpenInChromeVisible(), which controls the rest... Up to you.",
