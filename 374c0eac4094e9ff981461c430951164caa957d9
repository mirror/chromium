      "message": "Just pointing out what you\u0027re probably already aware of: these are somewhat more aggressive than the previous ones, in that they throw an exception on property access, before the value of the property is even used (for a function call, for addListener). This seems like it was likely intentional (and unpacked extensions being rare, probably not an issue?), but double-checking nonetheless.",

      "message": "This DCHECK is correct because it\u0027s impossible for such a context to have direct scripted access to another context without this restriction, right? (Otherwise, they can play games by plugging a function from one context into an object from another, which I think would make this DCHECK break.)",
