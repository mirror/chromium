      "message": "Should these set_* methods assert if DownloadTo* methods (or equivalent StartLoading-like methods if we add more) are not called yet?  Or does it make sense to introduce a struct like SimpleURLLoaderOption that has various setters for behavior options like this and to make the DownloadTo* methods take the param at once?  (net::URLFetcher has various Set* methods that are supposed to be called before the request is started, but it sometimes felt it\u0027s a bit error prone-- so asking similar question here)",
