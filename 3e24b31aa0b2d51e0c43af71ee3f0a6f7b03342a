      "message": "Why are so many parameters passed by non-const reference? Many of these, like |context| and |constructor|, are never modified.\n\nBesides that, v8::Local is just a pointer, so taking a reference to one is unnecessary unless you actually want to modify a variable in the caller. So this, for instance, should just be \"v8::Local\u003cv8::Context\u003e context\".",

      "message": "Probably this code isn\u0027t presently hot enough for it to matter, but adding and removing a TryCatch does require calling into V8 and isn\u0027t entirely free. If this were in one method, I\u0027d suggest just using a single TryCatch for the entire thing.\n\nAs multiple functions, the need to pass the TryCatch by reference makes things a little less clear.",
