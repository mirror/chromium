      "message": "The other use-case I was planing on adding soon is animated images. In the case where we only have impl-side pending trees, it seems that this would naturally throttle pending trees and avoid doing wasted work since blocking pending tree activation keeps us from creating a new impl-side pending tree.\n\nIn the case where we have a main thread commit, may be its better to skip the active tree draw? Since we might be blocking the main thread commit on this pending tree.",
