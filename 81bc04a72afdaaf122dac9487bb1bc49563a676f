Possibly you were affected by the sources assignment filter in GN instead; if so, we should be able to figure out what was going on and work around it.\n\nI ran some experiments in http://crrev.com/c/838000 and found my mistake :/ (see comment below).\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I think we should try to match the naming of platform variants used by the layout tests, e.g. \"mac10.9\", \"mac10.10\", \"win7\", \"win10\".\n\nDone. I copied the names that platform_info.py produces (i.e. the folders in src/third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/platform). On Mac, there is \u0027mac-retina\u0027, and mac-mac10.xx -- i.e. the \u0027mac\u0027 may repeat. Not sure if that\u0027s intentional, but I\u0027ve gone for consistency.",
