Obviously we should try to prevent that in general, but if we miss an edge case could this get called later with bad results?\n\nBasically I am wondering if we should set and save this state in the constructor.",

(If you pre-populate it and use it later without knowing this, it may use wrong modality)  I checked several usages, and they creates and show it\nimmediately so this shouldn\u0027t really matter though.\n\nMaybe changing the modality is an issue because it\u0027s yet another modality.",
