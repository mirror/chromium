One cannot claim copyright over it just due to the act of copying.\n\nIf you change a variable name(s) only in that expression in code, (inflate_fast -\u003e inflate_fast_chunky here), do you think it\u0027s fair to claim copyright over it? The advice I received from our opensource folks was no, it is not fair.\n\nPerhaps speak to your ARM opensource folks if possible if you are unclear about these points, but let\u0027s respect Mark Adler\u0027s copyright in this file.",
