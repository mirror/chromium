The CreateGpuFenceINTERNAL method directly forwards the request asynchronously to gles2_cmd_decoder\u0027s DoCreateGpuFenceINTERNAL, and there\u0027s no way for that to return an ID without making it synchronous. It just needs a locally generated ID for reference in other commands.\n\nCreateImage uses GpuChannelHost\u0027s base::AtomicSequenceNumber next_image_id_ for its numbers to get channel-unique IDs, which seems unnecessary here. If I\u0027m understanding it right, the GPU fence IDs only need to be unique within a stream, and MakeIds does that, similar to how texture IDs get allocated. There\u0027s currently no need for cross-stream GPU fence IDs.\n\nAlso, both creation paths for GPU fences (from scratch, or clone from handle) need to share an ID space, and it seems odd to call a gpu_control method just to generate an ID here.",
