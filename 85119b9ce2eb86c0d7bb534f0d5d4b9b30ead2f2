      "message": "Is it useful to track these three booleans separately? It seems like we could just have a single bool (is_running_, or whatever) that determines whether this scope is responsible for reporting RCS (enabled \u0026\u0026 no parent).\n\nThat should suffice to determine whether we need to pass the runtime-call-stats parameter to the TRACE_EVENT_END{X}.",
