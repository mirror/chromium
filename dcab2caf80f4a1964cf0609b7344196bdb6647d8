      "message": "This TODO comment isn\u0027t clear.  It makes it sounds like the whole block (including what was there before) should be removed.  There also isn\u0027t a clear connection between CanReadRawCookies and DevTools, or how it relates to this bug.  Can I suggest something like the following?\n\nFor now, DevTools needs the POST data sent to the renderer process even if it is no longer a POST after the redirect.  Detect if it is DevTools using CanReadRawCookies.\nTODO(caseq): Send the full request data to DevTools and remove the |can_read_raw_cookies| check here.\n\n\n(Related question: Is CanReadRawCookies granted to the DevTools process, or to normal web renderers that have DevTools attached?)",

      "message": "source_site_instance() doesn\u0027t seem like the right thing to use here, given the subtle differences in how it\u0027s defined between renderer and browser initiated navigations.\n\nCan we use frame_tree_node_-\u003ecurrent_frame_host()-\u003eGetSiteInstance() directly here?  (Or rather, frame_tree_node_-\u003ecurrent_frame_host()-\u003eGetProcess()?)  The current RFH seems to be used in many other places in NavigationRequest, and should represent the current page.\n\nNormally, I\u0027d be concerned about that being wrong for navigations that target a different frame.  Here, though, I think it might do the right thing.  Suppose frame A targets frame B with a navigation that redirects from C (POST) to D (GET).  If I understand correctly, we want to leave the post_data around if frame B has DevTools attached, since that\u0027s the DevTools instance that will be showing the network activity?\n\nIf so, that means we definitely want the current_frame_host() and not the source_site_instance() (which would be A).\n\n(Side note for Camille: Can you write a CL to update the comments for source_site_instance on NavigationRequest?  It seems to be lacking comments in some places and has incorrect comments in others, like saying it\u0027s only for browser-initiated navigations at the declaration site.)",
