(I get a presubmit error: \n\nYou added one or more #includes that violate checkdeps rules.\n  components/tracing/child/child_trace_message_filter.cc\n      Illegal include: \"services/resource_coordinator/public/cpp/memory_instrumentation/memory_instrumentation.h\"\n    Because of no rule applying.)\n\nNot sure what the cleanest way to avoid this is given we expect this to be very temporary. I could inject another function pointer into MDM?",
