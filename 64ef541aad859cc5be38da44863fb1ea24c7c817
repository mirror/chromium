      "message": "I added you to the bug, sorry about that. It seems that shouldEnableURL works differently for folder upload dialogs vs file upload dialogs. I thought that shouldEnableURL enables/disables the OK button, which is how it appears to work for folder upload... but for file uploads, it just disables all URLs. I\u0027m reverting and will investigate, and can also address your other nits when re-landing.",

      "message": "Drive-by interest.\n\nTrent is right. -panel:shouldEnableURL: is about enabling files to be selected, not about enabling the \"Open\" button. How have you tested this CL? From what I see, this disables selecting any file until a file is selected.\n\nAlso, I believe that the open panel caches the results of this method, which means that switching it to return a different value for the same files will be troublesome.",
