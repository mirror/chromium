      "message": "Sadly no. Unity builds (like jumbo) work by joining many cc files in the same translation unit and then those files will share the same anonymous namespace (and local static variables). We have some people trying to develop a change to clang to support this without having to rename things but it\u0027s not trivial and may never be possible. Until then we need a few hundred variables all over the Chromium source base to change name. \n\nIf you have a suggestion for a better name I\u0027m more than happy to change it. It is not easy figuring out optimal names for code you know very little about.\n\nThough, as suggested in the other comment, maybe it might as well be used as directly in the code. This variable might not add much.",
