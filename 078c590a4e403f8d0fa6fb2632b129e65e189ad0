      "message": "Hm, so this pattern is required when binding a OnceCallback to a RepeatingCallback, and it only works if the RepeatingCallback is actually only called once (so should really be a OnceCallback), right?\nThat\u0027s a bit ugly, but nothing to be done about it I guess. Can\u0027t fix everything. (I think there was some talk at some point of automatically converting Callback to OnceCallback across the codebase, but I don\u0027t know if anything came of that.)",
