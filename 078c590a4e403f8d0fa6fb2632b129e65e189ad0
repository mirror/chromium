      "message": "Hm, so this pattern is required when binding a OnceCallback to a RepeatingCallback, and it only works if the RepeatingCallback is actually only called once (so should really be a OnceCallback), right?\nThat\u0027s a bit ugly, but nothing to be done about it I guess. Can\u0027t fix everything. (I think there was some talk at some point of automatically converting Callback to OnceCallback across the codebase, but I don\u0027t know if anything came of that.)",

      "message": "Hm, thinking more about it, you don\u0027t really lose much: It\u0027s also possible to (try to) call a OnceCallback twice; the second try will of course fail because the callback has been nulled out.\nWith this idiom, pretty much the same happens: The second try will fail, because the passed-in OnceCallback is null. The downside is just that things are less obvious.",
