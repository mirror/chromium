      "message": "I\u0027ve discussed with escordeiro@ about it and, at least for teamfood, we\u0027re assuming the account is not a child if decoding fails or id_token is not received.\n\nLet\u0027s continue discussing, though, the best way to handle this case. For now, we wouldn\u0027t change the handling if this information isn\u0027t available. Thus, I propose to add it when we start doing something different with this.\n\nBut, definitely, we should better consider this case.",

      "message": "I think we all agree that it\u0027s undesired to \"swallow\" errors in fetching the id_token. However, IMO if we fail to get an id_token, we shouldn\u0027t let the user session resume -- we should stop it immediately. I don\u0027t think that a consumer should try to run without this information.\n\nTo address this, there\u0027s likely a bigger change to be made earlier in the flow so that this can happen. Alexander, do you think we should just return nullptr from |ExtractOAuth2TokenPairResponse| if we fail to find an id_token? That\u0027s what Luciana and I were considering before, but we decided to play it safe for now and let the session proceed as a non-child session.",
