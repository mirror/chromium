      "message": "I\u0027ve discussed with escordeiro@ about it and, at least for teamfood, we\u0027re assuming the account is not a child if decoding fails or id_token is not received.\n\nLet\u0027s continue discussing, though, the best way to handle this case. For now, we wouldn\u0027t change the handling if this information isn\u0027t available. Thus, I propose to add it when we start doing something different with this.\n\nBut, definitely, we should better consider this case.",
