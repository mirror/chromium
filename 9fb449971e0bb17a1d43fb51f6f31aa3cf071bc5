      "message": "Yes, it\u0027s possible. But I\u0027d rather make that a separate test for the datachannel counters - there are a number of things that we could test wrt how that\u0027s incremented. This test is about making sure we get data out of getStats at all.\n\nThat\u0027s what I said in the note that I sent when I asked for review.\nCan we fix one problem at a time?",
