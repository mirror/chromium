      "message": "given that not all navigation handles are allowed to report UKM, we might consider changing this method signature slightly, to something like:\nukm::GetSourceId(navigation_handle, ukm::SourceIdType::NAVIGATION_ID);\n\nthen, internally to GetSourceId, we can DCHECK that the navigation handle is a main frame navhandle, and enforce any other ukm-specific policy related to nav handle.",

      "message": "That would require the GetSourceId function to depend on content/public, so I don\u0027t think it can replace this method.  We could define a wrapper function which does that, but I think that\u0027s a seperate question, so I\u0027ll leave that until we have resolution on having NavigationId.",
