      "message": "This looks like the most reasonable place to act on whether the Origin Trial is enabled or not - it\u0027s got access to a WebUserMediaRequest which could carry this information. It sort-of does, through its connection to a Document etc. I\u0027ve added a couple of proposals on how this could be done, but neither is very pretty. The one that\u0027s currently enabled does seem to work, but it also does cut through a number of layers of abstraction to do so.\n\nPlease advise!",
