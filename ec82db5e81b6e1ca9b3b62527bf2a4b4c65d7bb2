      "message": "Ah, yes, one of the hardest things in programming: naming things.\n\n\u0027font\u0027 does seem a bit generic, but this is probably the best candidate for the name (it is the library for all things to do with font files).\n\nCalling it harfbuzz_freetype or freetype_harfbuzz is explicit and clear, but it would bother me that this is effectively FreeOpenFreeType or FreeTypeFreeOpen (roughly). I think freetype_harfbuzz could be loosely translated/read as \"FreeType is being a pain again\".\n\nI rather like HarfType (more or less FreeType, but half transliterated Persian) which also seems fairly clear. A bit silly, but HarfSchriftart (half Persian / half German FreeType) seems somewhat appropriate but less obvious as to pedigree.\n\nMaybe we should ask Behdad and Werner what they\u0027d call it.",
