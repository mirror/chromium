I think freetype_harfbuzz could be loosely translated/read as \"FreeType is being a pain again\".\n\nI rather like HarfType (more or less FreeType, but half transliterated Persian) which also seems fairly clear. A bit silly, but HarfSchriftart (half Persian / half German FreeType) seems somewhat appropriate but less obvious as to pedigree.\n\nMaybe we should ask Behdad and Werner what they\u0027d call it.",
