      "message": "While I don\u0027t think this value is security sensitive, if I were to fully apply my interpretation of the style guidelines, we should report a bad message for out-of-range values. However, adding a new enum value is kind of a pain and a very one-off kind of thing. I guess let\u0027s just leave it like this and wait for Mojo conversion, which will make it easier to report a bad message.\n\n(As an aside, I\u0027m wondering if we should avoid sending this IPC at all now for non-main frames? I guess it makes things easier to do it this way though--since we also call it in DidStartLoading / DidStopLoading.)",
