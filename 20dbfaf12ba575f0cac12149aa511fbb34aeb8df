If so, sure, nullptr is better)\n\nI guess really your IDE/text editor should surface the info for you, so I can\u0027t complain too much.",

      "message": "// Called when ServiceWorkerNetworkProvider is destructed. This function severs the Mojo binding to the browser-side ServiceWorkerProviderHost. The reason ServiceWorkerNetworkProvider is special compared to the other providers, is that it is destructed synchronously when a service worker client (Document) is removed from the DOM. Once this happens, the ServiceWorkerProviderHost must destruct quickly in order to remove the ServiceWorkerClient from the system (thus allowing unregistration/update to occur and ensuring the Clients API doesn\u0027t return the client).",
