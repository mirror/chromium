      "message": "After looking everywhere this MediaRemotingStatus is used, it seems superfluous. Let\u0027s get rid of it. It\u0027s basically only being used for doing what, IMHO, is some excessively-paranoid DCHECKing over something that we really don\u0027t care about.\n\nMediaRemotingStarted() or MediaRemotingStopped() *might* be called more than once in a row, but they are notifications that indicate whether the remoting interstitial UI should be showing or not. It\u0027s fine if once in a while they are called twice in a row, especially during the complex startup and shutdown sequence between this code and the platform impl (WMPI and related object graph). Said another way, it\u0027s bad to restrict method call sequences so rigidly when they are a part of call stacks from code in a distant module.",
