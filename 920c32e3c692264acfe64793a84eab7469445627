      "message": "Apologies for it being early, but why the RefCountedData wrapping? That\u0027s not entirely obvious?\n\nIs it because you\u0027re trying to have the factory provide multiple distinct CertVerifiers (via CreateCertVerifier) that all share the same underlying MockCertVerifier? If so, can you speak more to the design choices there - and perhaps document more?",
