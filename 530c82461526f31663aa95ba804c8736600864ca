      "message": "Why do we need to do a PostTask here? Can\u0027t we do a synchronous check and return directly? The content/ layer should be able to handle the throttle implementation doing a load and deleting itself. It will keep the overhead of navigations lower, as we don\u0027t need to wait for a full event loop to compute the result.",

      "message": "Since this is a WebView specific code, let\u0027s not register it for all Android navigations, especially if we must keep the behavior of \"defer, PostTask, check, cancel | resume\". This will add an extra delay in navigations in Chrome on Android, which is undersirable, as it doesn\u0027t support this WebView API.\n\nChatting with boliu@, it should be possible to put this registration in chrome/android_webview/ and use a content/public API through ContentBrowserClient to let the WebView code register it itself.",
