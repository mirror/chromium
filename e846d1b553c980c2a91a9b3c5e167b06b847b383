      "message": "For OCSP we need to ensure that the certificate contains correct port number for OCSP server.  There are two ways to make it work:\n1. Pass self.host_ocsp_port instead of 0 for the first parameter. It\u0027s the port number on the target device. 0 means that it\u0027s allocated dynamically.\n\n2. Detect when OCSP is enabled from the command line, and forward the port first before starting testserver.py. Then pass self.forwarder_ocsp_device_port using --ocsp-proxy-port-number argument in the command_line.\n\nThe first solution may be flaky because it\u0027s not possible to guarantee that the port is available on device . (2) is slightly more complex but it would be more reliable.",
