      "message": "Could this hash be moved into the update_sdk.py script, similar to the update clang script?\n\nV8 auto-rolls src/build as a subrepro into its own DEPS. But other changes made in chromium are not seen by the auto-roller. If this hash was somewhere inside src/build, rolling deps to subprojects would work smoothly.\n\nOtherwise manual intervention is needed from time to time as in: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/890367",
