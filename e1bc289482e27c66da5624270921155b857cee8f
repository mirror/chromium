We can\u0027t ever restore it.  I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a good way to identify the affected NavEntries, though.  Maybe that would get solved if we finished https://crbug.com/373041 and shared FNEs between NavEntries, though.\n\nThat is a good point.  I think removing FNEs just on the *current* NavEntry is sufficient for now.  WDYT?  \n\nI agree that sharing of FNEs between NavEntries would help, but I also note that in this CL we are deleting TreeNodes (and only transitively deleting FNEs) - I assume that sharing will just help identify all the TreeNodes that refer to the FNE.  Based on this, I think this requires extra work on top of sharing, so I\u0027ve opened a bug to track this: https://crbug.com/785534\n\nWe can discuss further on the new bug, but I am a bit hesitant to walk *all* NavEntries when a dynamically created frame is removed.  Please let me know if you have other ideas (other than walking *all* NavEntries of a given WebContents) for identifying FNEs that can be pruned.\n\n\u003e There\u0027s a similar question when doing any cross-document navigation in any frame.  We could safely remove all FNEs for dynamic subframes of that frame.  But maybe that\u0027s best left for the cleanup phase being discussed in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/713474?\n\nI am not sure if I understood, but I think you are talking about a scenario where\n1. a parent frame has some dynamic subframes\n2. the parent gets navigated away (which means the subframes are deleted)\n3. we no longer need FNEs for the deleted dynamic subframes\n\nI\u0027ve tried adding a browser test for this scenario (PruningOfEntriesForDynamicFrames_ParentNavigatedAway) and this test is passing.  The fact that the test passes surprises me a little bit (I initially thought that I might have to move the pruning somewhere else - maybe to the destructor of FrameTreeNode), but I guess is a good thing.  FWIW, the pruning happens in the following callstack (the same callstack as in the previous browser test added by this CL):\n\n#2 0x7f307531ef7b content::NavigationEntryImpl::RemoveTreeNode()\n#3 0x7f307531eebb content::NavigationEntryImpl::RemoveTreeNode()\n#4 0x7f30752dc67d content::FrameTreeNode::RemoveChild()\n#5 0x7f30752d58bd content::FrameTree::RemoveFrame()\n#6 0x7f307535ad76 content::RenderFrameHostImpl::OnDetach()",
