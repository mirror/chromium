      "message": "Did this actually create a build failure in jumbo? What if instead of using extern or static we put the .cpp defs within an empty namespace in each .cpp file, like:\n\nnamespace {\n\nconst char* kUnknownString \u003d \"Unknown\";\n\n}\n\nDoes that fix jumbo build? Would be preferable since Blink in general doesn\u0027t use many externs and it leaks the internal impl detail in a way and clutters the public namespace with the const.\n\nOr, I would also be supportive of getting rid of the constant and just using the \"Unknown\" literal like you mentioned.",
