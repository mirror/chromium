      "message": "Thanks, Can you drop it below the TRACE_EVENT so its not skipping being accounted in traces (its cheap but in principle)?\n\nWorth a comment to mention that this contributes to damage, so we reset it once we we\u0027re going to draw? (Which leads me to wonder if this is correct cuz we might not actually draw, we can abort below still, and then we won\u0027t tell the browser about the handle change.)",
