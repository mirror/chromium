It adds unnecessary cost (extra field and a check in get()), and it is a little confusing because the whole point of this class is to manage the lifetime of |ptr_|.\n\nDoes it make sense to do a little more work in testing code to setup a real SharedInterfacePtr and get rid of this CreateForTesting?",
