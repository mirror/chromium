      "message": "I don\u0027t think it\u0027s entirely unrelated. One of the main reasons why we wanted a Feature Policy for EME was because it has the potential to show a prompt from an iframe, which can be confusing for users. It\u0027s true that the feature won\u0027t always request permission though.\n\nI think the link is ok because I think it still clearly explains to developers what the changes are and how to continue to make things work.",
