      "message": "That\u0027s a fair point. It was not intentional -- I\u0027d only been thinking about flicker due to new UI elements appearing in quick succession. That said, the flicker due to a single keypress would usually be new elements, right? Wouldn\u0027t you have to click another button on the kb to set up a new query w/ new results?",

But what if you initially get 4, then 5 soon after, where one of the original 4 is displaced?  That\u0027s all I meant.",
