      "message": "I\u0027ve updated the code to do this, but I ran into an issue b/c aria-label is set w/o calling polymer so it\u0027s reflected to the dom. This is unwanted behavior b/c it means that a screen reader will read the same text twice. I worked around it by creating a function that just returns the string, but this seems hacky and wrong. Do you have any ideas of how we could do that better?",
