      "message": "While on the one hand this is simpler than something I suggested elsewhere, but it also seems confusing.\n\nWhat do you think about adding an \u0027ariaLabel\u0027 property and getAriaLabel_(ariaLabel, label) { return ariaLabel || label } ?\n\nThat would also give us the ability to set a different aria-label from label.",

      "message": "I\u0027ve updated the code to do this, but I ran into an issue b/c aria-label is set w/o calling polymer so it\u0027s reflected to the dom. This is unwanted behavior b/c it means that a screen reader will read the same text twice. I worked around it by creating a function that just returns the string, but this seems hacky and wrong. Do you have any ideas of how we could do that better?",

      "message": "If the screen reader is reading this twice, can we just not set aria-label on the paper-toggle-button?\n\nOtherwise, maybe name this differently, say \u0027a11yLabel\u0027? That would also remove the need to set \u0027reflectToAttribute\u0027 or provide an empty default value (i.e. just \u0027a11yLabel: String\u0027).\n\nOr, if we want to make \u0027ariaLabel\u0027 \"just work\" for settings-toggle-button (which is appealing), we could provide an observer for the \u0027ariaLabel\u0027 property which would explicitly set the attribute for the paper-toggle-button and unset it for the element itself? (I\u0027m not 100% certain if/how that would work).",
