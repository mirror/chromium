      "message": "Not sure adding an API to WebContentsObserver is the only way to accomplish this.\n\nI think the media route used for mirroring could carry some state information and the UI could observe that; we\u0027ve wanted to do this for a while anyway to better sync up the UX with the state of the MR (for example, to only navigate to route details once the Cast device has sent us a status message).\n\nDesigning a media route status API to meet the various needs of different cast modes is a bigger project, but if this feature is the only one that would ever use the capturer observer, maybe worth it if it can fix other issues too?\n\nOr maybe it makes sense to have the capturer observer API anyway, and we can tackle the route status issue later.",

      "message": "the media route could carry some extra state around, but it wouldn\u0027t know anymore about the capture then we could check at this point.  But I agree that we could better organizing how and what things are getting passed around for route statuses right now.\n\nWe would have to have a capture observer API either way in this case, and while I am considering taking on 54096 it feels a bit more involved.\n\nAlso note that this code is copied from offscreen tab implementation which does the same polling: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/extensions/api/tab_capture/offscreen_tab.h?l\u003d225\n\nThe capture observer API would address both scenarios.",

      "message": "The polling in offscreen_tab is accomplishing something a little different - it\u0027s basically a back channel to the Media Router so that when the associated media route is terminated (which destroys the capturer) the offscreen tab is cleaned up.\n\nIn general replacing the polling in this patch and the tests with observers of the underlying state changes should be done, but it\u0027s not clear to me what layer needs to be observed (capturer vs. media route).  Let\u0027s discuss offline with input from imcheng@.\n\nAs a secondary discussion, triggering remoting from the browser side without requiring fullscreen is something we should queue a task for (after some PM input).  I feel this is necessary for a good Remote Playback API implementation and could be useful here.",
