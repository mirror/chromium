      "message": "This function does not seem to be testing pan-left, pan-right ...\n\nAs a meta comment, I think the test much better now but the new patch is \ntaking the test parametrization too far and making the test too complex.\n\nNow to actually understand the test one has to fully understand getScrollCustomizationFromValidGestureSet\nand how this machinery relies on getPowerSet, validGestureSet and ALL_GESTURE\ntoo generate all possible inputs. This makes the test less readable and any \nbug in input generation can lead to test not being effective. In general making \nthe test too complex is not a good idea.\n\nI think the test should be parametrized but please use constant static input\nvalues as opposed to trying to generate them. In this case the number of\npermutations is not that many so there is not actually much that the input generation\nis saving.\n\nA simple table of ||scroll-customization value | gestures to be tests| callbacks expected||\nshould work. e.g.\n\nconst test_table \u003d [\n [\"none\",     [GESTURE_RIGHT, GESTURE_LEFT, GESTURE_TOP, GESTURE_DOWN] , false]\n [\"pan-left\", [GESTURE_RIGHT, GESTURE_TOP, GESTURE_DOWN]               , false]\n [\"pan-left\", [GESTURE_LEFT] ,                                         , true]\n [\"pan-x\",    [GESTURE_TOP, GESTURE_DOWN]                              , false]\n [\"pan-x\",    [GESTURE_LEFT, GESTURE_RIGHT] ,                          , true]\n  ....\n];\n\n\n\u003e Note quite sure if I understand bonus #2 though.\nIt was suggesting that for example in above table item 3 can be automatically generated\nbased on item 2. But I think not doing that is actually better for readability of\nthe test in light of above discussion.",
