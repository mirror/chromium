      "message": "Hmm, maybe I\u0027m wrong, but I\u0027m afraid this modification can lead to an unwanted change of behavior in a corner case.\nSuppose ConfigureCertificates() raises |network_properties_changed_| and then calls into ResolvePendingNetworks() due to non-empty |queued_networks_to_resolve_|, and then it goes into ResolveNetworks() and |networks_to_resolve| turns out to be empty (for instance, due to the network being disappeared or the policy having changed for it). In this case, notifications will be fired with |false| from here, while they should have been |true|.\n\nMaybe I\u0027m wrong with the above?.. And if not, then, unfortunately, I haven\u0027t put much thought into how this code could be restructured to avoid this problem.",

      "message": "Excellent point! This is absolutely correct.\n\nThe reason why I moved the computation of the \"changed\" bool was because I felt it was cleaner and should be done outside of NotifyResolveRequestCompleted. It is not a good enough reason to break it :)\n\nI\u0027ve moved it back inside -- this way, the new behavior should be:\n- any time NotifyResolveRequestCompleted is called, it states whether changes have been made since the last NotifyResolveRequestCompleted call.\n- NotifyResolveRequestCompleted is only called when no task is queued.\n- NotifyResolveRequestCompleted is called when a queued task finishes and there are no pending networks to be resolved.\n\nBTW, do you think we should introduce DCHECK_CALLED_ON_VALID_SEQUENCE assertions in this class?",
