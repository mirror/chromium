      "message": "Hmm, maybe I\u0027m wrong, but I\u0027m afraid this modification can lead to an unwanted change of behavior in a corner case.\nSuppose ConfigureCertificates() raises |network_properties_changed_| and then calls into ResolvePendingNetworks() due to non-empty |queued_networks_to_resolve_|, and then it goes into ResolveNetworks() and |networks_to_resolve| turns out to be empty (for instance, due to the network being disappeared or the policy having changed for it). In this case, notifications will be fired with |false| from here, while they should have been |true|.\n\nMaybe I\u0027m wrong with the above?.. And if not, then, unfortunately, I haven\u0027t put much thought into how this code could be restructured to avoid this problem.",
