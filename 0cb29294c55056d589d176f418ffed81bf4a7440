Considering such a scenario:\n - The 1st request comes with callback_1, |state_| is set to kWaiting, |callback_| is set to callback_1.\n - The 2nd request comes with callback_2, as this is an invalid request, we need to mojo::ReportBadMessage(), and also need to cache callback_2, but we can\u0027t put it into |callback_|, that will destroy callback_1 which will complain it has never been run before its destruction.",
