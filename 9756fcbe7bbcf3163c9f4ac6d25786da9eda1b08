      "message": "That\u0027s an interesting thought. Let\u0027s find out! :) I filed https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/542915 for this.\n\nIt seems that it introduces test regressions, but that may just be because underlying problems get exposed.\n\nI did some local testing, and I found one test in fast/block/float/ that started acting up. Upon closer inspection, that test looks flaky even without my changes, but I\u0027ll get back to that.\n\nAlso, it seems that such a change causes regressions in LayoutNG (only tested fast/multicol/ locally)",
