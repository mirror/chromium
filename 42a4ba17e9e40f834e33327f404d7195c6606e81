      "message": "I just realized that now RWHVA and WCAA each depend on each other.\nIt\u0027s not terrible, but generally it\u0027s cleaner to have dependencies\ngoing in just one direction and to use a delegate or client interface\nthe other way.\n\nRight now we mostly have renderer_host and frame_host depending on\naccessibility and not the other way around. BAM has a delegate\ninterface for communicating back with the RFH that owns it.\n\nMaybe consider doing the same thing, having WebContentsAccessibilityAndroid not directly reference RenderWidgetHostViewAndroid, but instead indirectly through a delegate interface.",
