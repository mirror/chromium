      "message": "It seems that iPhone 6/7/8 is the only thing currently using this syntax so I think it is okay for now, and the implementation looks good.\n\nI worry that later we will have more devices that use a similar syntax that cannot be parsed in this way. Maybe we should look for startswith \u0027iPhone\u0027 instead of whether there is a \u0027/\u0027 in the title since it is only one case currently.",
