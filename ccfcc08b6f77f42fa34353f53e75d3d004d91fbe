      "message": "Is there any race condition where the PowerMonitorBroadcastSource isn\u0027t guaranteed to be fully initialized (since PowerMonitorBroadcastSource::Client::Init is called on a different thread), and operations start being done on the power_monitor_? I don\u0027t see any; only asking. It looks like it\u0027s fine that the initialization is done in the background, and once the device::mojom::PowerMonitorClient is set up, power events will start being broadcast to any observers which have since been registered.",
