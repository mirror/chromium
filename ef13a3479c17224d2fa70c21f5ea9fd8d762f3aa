      "message": "It seems like a bug in Blink if we need to do this. If the target\nof an aria-labelledby is changing, Blink already needs to compute\nits name.\n\nIt\u0027s not clear to me how this code would help. If Blink didn\u0027t\nupdate the node that you\u0027re firing NAME_CHANGED on here, its\naccessible name will still be wrong. But if it did, then it will\nalready have the event fired.",
