      "message": "\u003e \u003e \u003e Agreed that dynamically inserting doesn\u0027t help. So IIUC, the problem is: To make this accessible to CSS, it needs to be an actual \u003csvg\u003e element, and those only support inline source.\n\u003e \u003e \u003e It seems one solution would be to have a dedicated style sheet for the svg file (example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/SVG_and_CSS) but that seems like overkill.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e That actually doesn\u0027t help, if the SVG is then inserted in (a different) CSS file.\n\u003e \u003e As far as I can tell, it basically reduces to the same problem - when the SVG is inserted through CSS, you cannot style it.\n\u003e \n\u003e Hm - I assumed that we could then just set the style and it\u0027d apply properly, without even inlining the SVG into the CSS. But I might be wrong, this is all quite confusing.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what you mean exactly. I couldn\u0027t find/think of a way to make this work. If you have something specific and have time to try it out/describe it to me, go for it :)\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e \u003e Alternatively, from what I can tell the remote NTP actually creates the microphone icon in pure CSS. Any reason for not doing that here?\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e Well, it doesn\u0027t really \"scale\" well. The CSS is very hard to read and interpret (at least for me), and cannot be easily changed when icons update in the future. Also, we cannot reasonably guarantee that the icon is the same as the \"official Google Material design mic icon\" (http://icons/mic). In general, I do not like the CSS approach because of this.\n\u003e \n\u003e I\u0027d argue that the SVG isn\u0027t any easier to read ;P  But you\u0027re right, it\u0027d be easier to keep updated. Though if it requires manual pasting of the file contents, it\u0027s also not that awesome.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e IIRC, the reason for creating it in CSS for the remote NTP was a smaller download size:\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e \u003e All the output elements with the exception of the Google logo (see below) are made up using only CSS3 to minimize the bundle size that would be needed for the large icons and animations. The design of the mic is taken from the kennedy style mic icon.\n\u003e \n\u003e Hm, I guess they were comparing to a bitmap icon? I don\u0027t see why the CSS would be smaller than SVG. Anyway, negligible difference.\n\nYes, I assumed the same thing.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e On the other hand, our styling issues would be gone in a heart beat.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e Bottom line -- I see three options at the moment:\n\u003e \u003e 1. Keep the icon inline in HTML.\n\u003e \u003e 2. Dynamically insert it into the DOM when loading (haven\u0027t tested thoroughly, but I can\u0027t see why that wouldn\u0027t work).\n\u003e \u003e 3. Create the icon in CSS.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e WDYT?\n\u003e \n\u003e I\u0027d say, unless we find a way to use an actual svg file (i.e. without manual inlining), let\u0027s go with the CSS like the remote NTP.\n\n(As you might have noticed,) I really don\u0027t like the CSS icon approach :/ I tried to implement an example of approach 2. WDYT? If you don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea, I will just use the CSS icon.",
