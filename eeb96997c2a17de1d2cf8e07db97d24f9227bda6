      "message": "This makes me kind of nervous, mostly about having too much unnecessary data from the previous subframe (similar to dcheng\u0027s concerns about cloning the PageState).  It also feels a little awkward reaching inside the (semi-private) NavigationEntryImpl::TreeNode struct here.\n\nWhich parts are actually needed for view-source?  Maybe we can create a fresh NavigationEntry (no clone at all) and just fill in the bits we need?\n\nI suspect that would include:\n - URL\n - PageState with just the URL and POST data\n - Method\n - post_id\n\nI suspect we wouldn\u0027t want to copy:\n - frame_unique_name_ (which is empty for the main frame)\n - ISN/DSN (don\u0027t make sense in the new process)\n - SiteInstance\n - Source SiteInstance (should be empty after commit anyway)\n - Referrer\n - Redirect chain\n - Rest of PageState\n\nMaybe we can start with handling the PageState as we do now to land this and fix the bug, and then try having a PageState with just the URL and POST data in a followup CL?",

      "message": "- One concern with using a fresh NE/FNE/PageState would be that it would probably hit the network again (instead of returning cached content).  To avoid this we might need to also preserve whatever data the network stack uses to identify the request (I am not sure exactly what data).\n\n- I think that the server in the bug linked by this CL depends on preserving the Referer request header.\n\n- We would also need to preserve Content-Type of the POST data.\n\n\nWDYT about the concerns above?  Maybe the current approach is fine?\n\n\nPS. I think all of the above should be caught by the new browser tests (including the response nonce I am adding to /echoall handled in the other CL).",
