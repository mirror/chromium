      "message": "This makes me kind of nervous, mostly about having too much unnecessary data from the previous subframe (similar to dcheng\u0027s concerns about cloning the PageState).  It also feels a little awkward reaching inside the (semi-private) NavigationEntryImpl::TreeNode struct here.\n\nWhich parts are actually needed for view-source?  Maybe we can create a fresh NavigationEntry (no clone at all) and just fill in the bits we need?\n\nI suspect that would include:\n - URL\n - PageState with just the URL and POST data\n - Method\n - post_id\n\nI suspect we wouldn\u0027t want to copy:\n - frame_unique_name_ (which is empty for the main frame)\n - ISN/DSN (don\u0027t make sense in the new process)\n - SiteInstance\n - Source SiteInstance (should be empty after commit anyway)\n - Referrer\n - Redirect chain\n - Rest of PageState\n\nMaybe we can start with handling the PageState as we do now to land this and fix the bug, and then try having a PageState with just the URL and POST data in a followup CL?",
