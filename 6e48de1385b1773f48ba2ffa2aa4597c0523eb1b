      "message": "When I tried to open the lid very quickly, the angle readings directly jump into stable zone (e.g.open lid-\u003e100.1-\u003e102.5). Also when I rotate the lid very quickly, there\u0027s no angle readings in the middle. (e.g. the angle readings directly jumps from 160 to 60).\n\nThe angle readings look like \"120-\u003e30-\u003e17-\u003e2-\u003e358\" when closing the lid at the normal speed. While the readings look like \"120-\u003e358\" when closing the lid very quickly. The latter could also be interpreted as rotating the lid to fully opened very quickly. In this case, I think it is difficult to check erroneous reading based on recent rate of change in readings.\n\nAnother solution would be set a small range (e.g. [355,360]) as the delay zone. The tablet mode will be triggered if the readings continuously fall into the zone more than 1 or 2 seconds. I tested several times and found that the readings only stay in [355,360] for less than 1 seconds before \u0027close\u0027 event is received no matter I close the lid quickly or slowly. Also, this solution does not add delay for other unstable angles. How do you think about this solution?",

      "message": "I like this idea, though this should probably be similar to the stable angle zone. A device that is fully open may appear to be almost closed at times so we shouldn\u0027t flip back to normal mode immediately in these cases either.\n\nSo to summarize, we can track how long the device has been in the current zone (open / close) and when the measured angle is in the unstable angle zone only switch if it has been in that zone for long enough?",

      "message": "Thanks. A device that is fully open must have unstable lid angle ([0,20] or [340,360]) which will not be used to leave tablet mode [1], so I think it is safe to only consider the angle to enter tablet mode.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ash/wm/tablet_mode/tablet_mode_controller.cc?sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d365",
