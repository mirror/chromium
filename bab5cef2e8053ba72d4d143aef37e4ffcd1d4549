      "message": "That is true, but I am still not quite sure what the semantics of GattServicesDiscovered should be. So I\u0027m very curious what ortuno@ has to say about this. I do agree though that calling GattServicesDiscovered when a new service is added makes intuitive sense and likely simplifies testing. I guess I\u0027m just not quite sure how common this is with real devices, I imagine in the majority of cases the list of services is static and doesn\u0027t change for a given device.\n\nortuno@, what is your take on this? In https://crbug.com/710352 you mention \n\n\u003e Note that a remote device that modifies GATT attributes is not tested or\nexpected to work with this code at this time.\n\nWhat is the expected behavior of GattServicesDiscovered in context of this?",
