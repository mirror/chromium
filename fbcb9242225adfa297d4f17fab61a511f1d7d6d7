      "message": "This isn\u0027t really part of this fix, but while debugging this, I noticed that I changed the ordering here in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/641818, as InitializeRenderFrame used to happen after ActivateExtensionInProcess.  So I restored the order just to be safe (it looks like InitializeRenderFrame sends some IPCs to the RFH, though I don\u0027t know if those might break if we don\u0027t activate the extension first), though if you think it doesn\u0027t matter I can undo it.",

      "message": "Changing this affects two call sites: ReloadIfTerminated, which we know needs this implementation, and ChromeExtensionWebContentsObserver::OnDetailedConsoleMessageAdded.  I don\u0027t really know how the latter works, but I *think* it\u0027s ok to use this new implementation for it also - if it\u0027s logging extension errors, it\u0027s probably better to log errors for a terminated extension as well.  Definitely let me know if that\u0027s not the case though. :)",
