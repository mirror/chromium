At least from casual reading, it seems like without this, the test would still pass - the above expectation is satisfied, and there\u0027s one extra \"uninteresting call\".\nMaybe setting an expectation will actually make it \"strict\", but I\u0027d prefer to leave this here explicitly. It doesn\u0027t hurt, and it makes things clearer to me.",

I\u0027d propose sticking to this because, otherwise, so many tests that do EXPET_CALL(foo(x)) would in addition need to check that the method doesn\u0027t get called with some other arguments.
