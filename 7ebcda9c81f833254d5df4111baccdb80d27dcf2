      "message": "Does the filename itself need to be unique enough? Given that the path is already unique. For example webui/test_util.js different than webui/pdf/test_util.js and they can be easily located by searching for the path instead of searching for the filename only.\n\nThe current status (see https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q\u003dtest_util.js\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026type\u003dcs) seems preferable to me.\n\nAs a counter example, see https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/test/data/webui/extensions/, where most files are prefixed with \"extensions_\" which I find a bit redundant and cumbersome (and was planning to remove the prefixes).",
