For example webui/test_util.js different than webui/pdf/test_util.js and they can be easily located by searching for the path instead of searching for the filename only.\n\nThe current status (see https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q\u003dtest_util.js\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026type\u003dcs) seems preferable to me.\n\nAs a counter example, see https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/test/data/webui/extensions/, where most files are prefixed with \"extensions_\" which I find a bit redundant and cumbersome (and was planning to remove the prefixes).",

The processing we do on the provided stack trace is at https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/test/data/webui/mocha_adapter.js?q\u003dmocha_adapter.js\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr\u003dC\u0026l\u003d38,48.\n\nAlso, I simulated an error locally and the message I am getting is as shown at https://imgur.com/a/DDRdI. Specifically the line of interest is\n\"at Object.whenAttributeIs (test_util.js:15:5)\"\n\nIMO this seems enough information to locate which test_util.js file is referred here. I\u0027d rather avoid having non-optimal (redundant) file names, to compensate for a non-optimal error stack. This approach does not scale-able. We would have to rename multiple files following the same pattern (webui/test_util.js -\u003e webui/webui_test_util.js) which I don\u0027t think is worth the churn.",
