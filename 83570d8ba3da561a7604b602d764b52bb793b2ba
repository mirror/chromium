I hope we don\u0027t get into a state where every test specifies --restart because then it will be blocking for an arbitrary amount of time, and there\u0027s a risk that it could cause a good device to get rebooted into a bad state.\n\nCan we plan to revert this CL once we figure out what\u0027s wrong with the few devices that keep going unavailable?",
