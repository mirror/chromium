      "message": "Instead of slightly changing the name of this field from \"previewModifiable\" to \"isDocumentModifiable\", would it be easier to update the JS code to use previewModifiable directly?\n\nIt would  require updating this line only (I think)\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/resources/print_preview/print_preview.js?type\u003dcs\u0026l\u003d661 and we would not need kDocumentModifiable constant anymore.\n\nSame question for other fields in this dictionary. Basically do you think is worth reusing as many pre-existing printing::* constants already defined by updating the JS, instead of defining new ones here?",

      "message": "I am not sure. The printing:: constants all are also used for other purposes. Both kSettingPreviewModifiable and kSettingShouldPrintSelectionOnly are used for parsing the print ticket, and kSettingPrinterName is used when returning printer information. So using those means there is no longer a 1:1 mapping between the JS struct and the dictionary key constants, since the constants will be used for multiple messages to/from JS. I am not sure if it is better to avoid adding new strings or to avoid re-using the same strings in multiple messages. Do you know which approach is generally preferred?",
