      "message": "Generally speaking, this should indeed help with startup, as we create less contention for system resources at that time.\n\nHowever, the previous model we had was GSA pushing account change notifications, whereas here we are polling. Moving the polling point to a later stage may or may not be an issue.\nCan you confirm that this is fine?",

      "message": "Hm, IIUC, getting the GSA account happens asynchronously anyway, so the existing code is already able to deal with the account not being available. What will happen is of course that the interval where we don\u0027t have the account yet (and therefore nothing is reported) will be longer -- I guess that is a tradeoff we would have to accept if we decide to do this, but that interval already exists today.",
