      "message": "What effect does this filtering have compared to the original code? I assume that more than one keydown event is sent, and they they don\u0027t all have e.code \u003d\u003d \u0027KeyS\u0027, or there would be no difference. So, how many times is webkitRequestFullScreen() called? Rather than filtering by e.code, can you try a counter and just letting through some event(s) in the sequence, to see what matters? I\u0027m guessing that either the problem is with the number of calls, or their timing.",
