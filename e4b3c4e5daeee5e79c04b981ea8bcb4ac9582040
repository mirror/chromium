LayerTreeHostImpl::RootScrollBegin looks like it might be the right place, it\u0027s called from InputHandlerProxy when target_viewport is set to true (as I think it is in this case, right?). It\u0027s only called for GestureScrollBegin but you should be able to prevent setting a currently scrolling node which should then drop any following GSUs. Returning the right ScrollResult from there might even prevent generating GSUs but I\u0027m not sure how those get generated.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I follow. LayerTreeHostImpl::RootScrollBegin is not on the callstack for scrolls driven by InputHandlerProxy::SynchronouslySetRootScrollOffset as far as I can see. The path is actually quite direct, if you look at the implementation of LayerTreeHostImpl::SetSynchronousInputHandlerRootScrollOffset (which is called directly from the InputHandlerProxy). That function immediately \u0027distributes\u0027 the root scroll, which directly sets scroll offsets on the outer/inner viewport.",
