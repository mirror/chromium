      "message": "I think this should be higher up in the call stack.  LayerTreeHostImpl::RootScrollBegin looks like it might be the right place, it\u0027s called from InputHandlerProxy when target_viewport is set to true (as I think it is in this case, right?). It\u0027s only called for GestureScrollBegin but you should be able to prevent setting a currently scrolling node which should then drop any following GSUs. Returning the right ScrollResult from there might even prevent generating GSUs but I\u0027m not sure how those get generated.",
