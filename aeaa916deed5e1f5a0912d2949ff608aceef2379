      "message": "Thanks for sharing a screenshot. Yes I do think that a \u003cdialog\u003e is more appropriate in this case, for multiple reasons.\n\n1) \u003cdialog\u003e is modal, which means that the user can\u0027t interact with the background (neither with the mouse or with tabbing their way to background elements).\n2) ESC key automatically closes the dialog (improves user experience).\n3) \u003cdialog\u003e is automatically centered.\n\nI expect the changes to be fairly small, and the final amount of code needed (especially CSS) to be less than currently in this CL. Can you give it a try?",

      "message": "Changed to \u003cdialog\u003e.  I like the code better, but want your opinion on this:\n2) page is only shown on android, so ESC doesn\u0027t really apply here. Clicking outside the box does not make the modal disappear... (but neither did my impl before)\n3) \u003cdialog\u003e is centered to the page size. However, due to overflow (one of the tables is too big), the page is automatically zoomed out (see screenshot I sent you)",

You can probably prevent it with touch-action: none;\n\nAlso see updated example at https://jsfiddle.net/bkccrsd4/1/ where the dialog remains centered in both dimensions as the window gets resized.

      "message": "Zooming out is happening every other refresh (maybe because proxy and data loading?)\n\nQuickest repro is to go to wikipedia, save a page (menu -\u003e download button), then go to chrome://offline-internals on Android phone. If you don\u0027t see the zoom-out, then refresh the page.  On my phone at least, the dialog is vertically centered with zoom-out, and horizontally centered without zoom-out, but never both at the same time?\n\nSince this is on an internals page, I\u0027m not willing to spend much more time trying to get this super-centered. The dump to json button which uses a data-url before is completely broken, and priority should be to at least be able to view the contents first.",
