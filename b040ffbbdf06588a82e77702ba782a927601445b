If an alt svc is marked as broken, it shouldn\u0027t be saved to the nonbroken list. |alternative_service_map_| is used to get alternative service to use when we race TCP and QUIC in particular, thus we do require a nonbroken alt svc to be returned when we iterate the map. Why do we want to ignore the brokenness now? You might have context I missed I guess.",
