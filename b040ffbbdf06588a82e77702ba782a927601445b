      "message": "This is storing all the nonbroken alternative services right? I think the check is still needed. If an alt svc is marked as broken, it shouldn\u0027t be saved to the nonbroken list. |alternative_service_map_| is used to get alternative service to use when we race TCP and QUIC in particular, thus we do require a nonbroken alt svc to be returned when we iterate the map. Why do we want to ignore the brokenness now? You might have context I missed I guess.",

      "message": "Interesting. Ryan mentioned a while ago that all alternative services should now be persisted as part of this change. I assume because now that we store which ones are broken, when chrome restarts, we\u0027ll still be able to tell which alt svcs are broken or nonbroken.\n\nrch@, is this the behavior we want?",
