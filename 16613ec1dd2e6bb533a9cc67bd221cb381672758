      "message": "Oops, this is incorrect. The main thread will miss the deadline in a lot of cases where we will invalidate. What we really want to say is that if our prediction was incorrect and we skipped the invalidation as a result, don\u0027t defer the invalidation in the next frame. While I was at it, it looks like main_thread_missed_last_deadline might not be the most appropriate to use here. Its fine if the raster misses the deadline, as long as the commit happens before it IMO. Because a pending tree is extra raster and update that is not cancelable.",
