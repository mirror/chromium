      "message": "I like the general idea of this.\nI would prefer the ImageDecoder not know specifics of each image type, such as the signature.\n\nHowever, this probably isn\u0027t the way to do it.\n\nThis line will create a SkCodec, which sets up everything it needs to decode the image. Plus, the way SkCodec works is it parses the data it is given. So we will parse on this line.\n\nBut further below, we use the existing Blink image decoders to decode.\n\nYou could imagine a situation where we parse a bunch of information, then discard it and create a new image decoder which re-parses it.",
