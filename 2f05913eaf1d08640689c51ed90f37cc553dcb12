      "message": "Ah I see, of course. Thanks for explaining. That said, I think there was value in the previous version of checking against an explicit 0 for the ltr case; I am not sure this new approach tests very much except for internal consistency. Ideally, we\u0027d determine the size of the scrollbar (maybe measure it from an overflow:scroll diff) and check that the targetOffset is exactly that on the side where we expect it and 0 otherwise -- right? Isn\u0027t that what we really want to test?",
