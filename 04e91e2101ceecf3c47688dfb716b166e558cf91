      "message": "There is now no way to override this. I think this should either follow the pattern of having an Impl class, or add a jar_excluded_patterns to exclude this path so that apks can define their own BuildHooks class.\n\nGiven that the implementations of these methods is so trivial, it may actually be easier to follow if you don\u0027t have a separate Impl class. That would mean no ability to have default implementations, but they are so trivial that the added simplicity might be worth it.\n\nThat said, going back to using a Callback for this would probably work as well.\n\nIf you go the route of having it match BuildHooksAndroid, you\u0027ll also need to update java_binary(), create_dist_jar(). Another complication here is \"runtime_library_for_assets_java\", which is designed to be a stand-alone .dex file. For this one we should probably either create a new template for what they want (maybe \"dist_dex()\"?), or perhaps it would be enough to just mark the target as no_build_hooks \u003d true",

      "message": "I thought it seemed unnecessary to use a BuildHooksImpl class given that we don\u0027t need to supply a different version downstream and that there isn\u0027t code that won\u0027t compile in the existing BuildHooks.java (the two main reasons to use *HooksImpl I think?).\n\nMy plan was to leave this for now since I\u0027m not sure whether or not anyone is actively working on the assertion enabled-for-canary stuff.\n\nI think the Callback approach is better in this case. If we use BuildHooksImpl, we\u0027ll still need to solve the WebView/Chrome part right? But if we use the Callback, if it isn\u0027t set we know we\u0027re in Chrome and we could just plumb through a GN variable \"silent_assert_reporting\" to determine what kind of assert handling we want.\n\nIf that makes sense to you, I\u0027ll revert my changes to this file and Callback.java.",
