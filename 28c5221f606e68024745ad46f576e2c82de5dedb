      "message": "I think we need a neater solution for the pageinfo bubble -- the logic here is too scattered. the fix might have a similar theme to my suggestion in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/897749\n\nAlternatively, I think we can add an interface to BrowserWindow to help with this. Something like\n\n virtual .. BrowserWindow::GetLeadingBubbleAnchorRect() \u003d 0;\n\nthis is then implemented for BrowserView and BrowserWindowCocoa  -- i.e. we use runtime polymorphism rather than compile time polymorphism.\n\n\nThe neatest solution might be a combination of these :). See how you go..",
