      "message": "Actually \"//third_party/WebKit/public:mojo_bindings_blink\" was added for a similar reason, but I would be better to have it instead of mojo_blindings_blink. Also, it was missed in test_support target. So adding it to test_support was one possible fix for the build flake.\n\nBut, since loader/fetch code has a direct #include of cpp/cors_error_status.h, and interfaces/{cors|fetch_api}.mojom-blink.h, we should keep having these dependencies too? If we had only indirect includes, I completed agreed to replace them.",
