The equivalent to that is HAVE_WEAK_GETAUXVAL\u003d0 and not HAVE_WEAK_GETAUXVAL\u003d1.\n\nIf HAVE_WEAK_GETAUXVAL\u003d1 is correct for those platforms then I\u0027m cool with this change.",

      "message": "This is a fair point -- it\u0027s not immediately obvious that the change is correct.\n\nHAVE_WEAK_GETAUXVAL is only used here: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/crc32c/src/src/crc32c_arm64_linux_check.h?q\u003dHAVE_WEAK_GETAUXVAL\n\nIf HAVE_STRONG_GETAUXVAL\u003d1, the value of HAVE_WEAK_GETAUXVAL doesn\u0027t really matter. I left it out before, in the interest of keeping BUILD.gn smaller (little white lie?). Migrating to 0/1 variables forced me to explicitly state the value of each config macro, at which point there\u0027s no benefit in using the wrong value anymore.\n\nI think I should\u0027ve been clearer earlier. Now that we\u0027re using the 0/1 system, clarity was forced upon me :)",
