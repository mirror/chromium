      "message": "Edge case: On Windows you can\u0027t make \"C:\\foo\" relative to \"D:\\bar\". I think in this case we should return an absolute path and document this clearly in the header.\n\nActually we have MakeAbsolutePathRelativeIfPossible that deals with GN-style paths for a specific use-case. Unfortunately it looks like that\u0027s too specific to share code, but we should make the naming more clear.\n\nSo to go with MakeAbsolutePathRelativeIfPossible, make this new one should be MakeAbsoluteFilePathRelativeIfPossible.",
