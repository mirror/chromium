It seems to me you don\u0027t really want the paint offset, but the origin of the clip box.\n\nIs it okay to just change ScrollPaintPropertyNode::container_bounds_ to a IntRect and pass clip_rect instead?",

      "message": "That\u0027s a good point because the OverflowClipRect will also include things like borders.\n\nI\u0027ve updated the patch to use an IntRect offset from OverflowClipRect. I\u0027d like to keep the offset separate (i.e., IntPoint and IntSize instead of IntRect) because the offset applies to both the container bounds and the scroll bounds, and having it separate makes that more clear.",

      "message": "lgtm except one corner case (which shouldn\u0027t block this CL).\n\nSince Philip mentioned OverflowClipRect excludes the border. We are curious whether the border should participate in scroll gesture. Turns out our implementation is already inconsistent between main thread \u0026 impl thread hit testing. Main thread hit testing includes the border while impl thread hit testing excludes it. While I personally feel the latter behavior more intuitive, the spec may require the former. We should check the spec and 3rd-party implementation. May need to pass snapped border rect after all.",
