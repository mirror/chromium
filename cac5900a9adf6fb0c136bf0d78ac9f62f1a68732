It\u0027s just that we had no resources after the author (intern) left, and it got deprioritized.\n\nI would still very much like to launch this though, my hopes are for Q3/Q4. Can you please reflect that in your comment, so that someone at least talks to me before attempting removal?",

You\u0027re welcome to keep the code around, but if you could get rid of this particular function ASAP that would be helpful. Changing to base::Feature is easy, I refer you to the sample CLs referenced in the go/feature-flags-on-ios doc.",
