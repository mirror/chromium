      "message": "I did try to get rid of this mock client and use Js like you suggested, but finally failed.\nThe reason is, I found currently all the JS mojo implementations for layouttest are based on the MojoInterfaceInterceptor{.h|.cpp}, in which it overrides the connector and pass a \"mojo::ScopedMessagePipeHandle\" from native layer to JS layer.\nBut for ScreenOrientation, what we are manipulating is an AssociatedInterfacePtr. It wraps a \"ScopedInterfaceEndpointHandle\" which is defined in \"mojo/public/cpp\". I don\u0027t know how to pass the \"ScopedInterfaceEndpointHandle\" to JS, and I guess even we managed to pass it, the JS may have no idea on what it is because they are in different language scope.\n\nIf my above understanding is correct, we can wait some mojo experts to setup the infra first, then it will be easy to replace the native mock client by JS. WDYT?",
