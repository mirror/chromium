It\u0027s only when blur is the first filter that contents is passed through when we can use this optimization.\n\nFYI, I missed that this vector is reverse compared to Skia so it actually needs to be the last filter and not the first.

      "message": "We\u0027ll get aliasing if not using mipmaps. Divide by 2 can be done using bilerp without aliasing artifacts so that\u0027s as far as we can go as part of compositing for now.\n\nThe idea is to follow up with more down-scaling so we can get to the performance of my prototype (faster than no blur). Likely by keeping the 2x down-scaling here and just compute the mips in GLRenderer before passing the contents to skia so that skia can skip all down/up-scaling and compositing the result is more efficient.",
