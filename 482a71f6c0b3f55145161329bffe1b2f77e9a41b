If we want to enable/disable Desktop, we could force flags for a platform only or reintroduce a (possibly smarter than the current) logic to experiment with.\n\n(I moved enabling up. If a config forces a flag to disable the default-enabled feature, this should make it possible to manually override ... which is why we still have these flags.)",
