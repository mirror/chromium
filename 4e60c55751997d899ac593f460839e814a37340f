      "message": "Instead of abstracting over the constructor, e.g., specializing ConstructElement for Member\u003cT\u003e, we could also leave the regular placement new and follow up with a call such as\n  VectorTraits\u003cT\u003e::NotifyElementConstructedAt(start, end).\n\nThe benefit of such a solution would be that copying and moving becomes way cheaper for the \"marking off\" case as they check for incremental marking only needs to be done once.\n\nWDYT?",
