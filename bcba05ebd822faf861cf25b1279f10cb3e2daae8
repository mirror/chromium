By clearing the cache, a new entry (created in line 177-181) is added, using the current values in image_url_map_.\n\nOverall, this is probably a good thing! I\u0027m not super familiar with the codebase yet, so just raising this for confirmation.",

I believe the code the top sites and suggestion code has changed quite a bit in last week.\nWhateverz.. the pending_cache_request is never used after this point since the database is initialized. So, once we serve requests we can never add more requests. See |database_ready_|.",
