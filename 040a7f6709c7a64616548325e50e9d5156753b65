      "message": "Because we\u0027re just querying the content setting directly now, we don\u0027t need to factor this in for actually checking whether to use the value.\n\nThis function will just be used to decide whether to show the strings. In the old implementation we would should the string even if enterprise policy was in effect.\n\nThe only other thing we have to worry about is querying the wrong values from HostContentSettingMap when transitioning settings when EP is in effect. But I\u0027m going to implement a function in HCSM which just returns the user-defined values (in a followup). This simplifies the logic and ensures everything is consistent when transitioning DSEs.",
