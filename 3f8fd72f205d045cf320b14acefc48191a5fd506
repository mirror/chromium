Both the Iterator ctor(with offsets) and PaintOpBuffer::Playback(with offsets) are private with only DisplayItemList and SolidColorAnalyzer as friends. This just means that outside code can only do full playback (no offsets). For testing, I could\u0027ve friended each test but this seemed better? Or maybe I can just friend PaintOpBufferOffsetsTest... I did that instead.",
