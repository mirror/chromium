      "message": "Yup, that\u0027s exactly what we have to investigate, as the next step, so we can support style/layout lifecycle. I don\u0027t have a clear answer yet.\n\nMy *intuition* is that we have to walk recursively, however, I am not 100% sure of it until we can figure out how style/layout work with slots (in-flat-tree), and in which order dom trees should be traversed in layout (and layout tree should be constructed accordingly).\n\nNit; It looks that the current HTMLSlotElement::assignedElements doesn\u0027t consider IncrementalShadowDOM yet. That can be fixed as another issue.",
