Then it calls itself to run the non-initialization step and get the current time. If we leave this function as-is, we can make that more explicit. We don\u0027t need to call QueryPerformanceCounter(\u0026qpc) on the initialization step.\n\nBut I think even better than that would be to make separate start/stop functions. That way you can subtract the difference in the QuadPart before scaling up by clock frequency and then scaling down to get seconds. That scaling will introduce some error in the measurements.\n\nThis same idea applies to the non-win32 version below.

It should be in the range 8..15 for this version of the library.\"\n\nbut it goes on to add:\n\n\"windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate.

If you look at chrome uses of deflateInit2 in code search, you\u0027ll see:\n\n  memset(\u0026stream, 0, sizeof(stream));\n\njust before calls to deflateInit2().\n\nTechnically, zlib only cares about zalloc, zfree and opaque being 0.  For example, the compress2() helper in zlib show show how to use deflateInit/2 given a new z_stream [1].\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/zlib/compress.c?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d22\n\nNote how it only sets \n\n    stream.zalloc \u003d (alloc_func)0;\n    stream.zfree \u003d (free_func)0;\n    stream.opaque \u003d (voidpf)0;\n\nand then calls deflateInit()?  That\u0027s the minimum needed.\n\n\u003e When working on the fuzzers, I initialized like this [2].\n\nLet me add some notes to that.\n\n  z_stream stream;\n  stream.next_in \u003d input_buffer.data();\n  stream.avail_in \u003d size;\n  // following is not needed, zlib clears it to 0\n  stream.total_in \u003d size;\n  stream.next_out \u003d buffer;\n  stream.avail_out \u003d buffer_length;\n  // following not needed zlib, clears it to 0\n  stream.total_out \u003d buffer_length;\n  stream.zalloc \u003d Z_NULL;\n  stream.zfree \u003d Z_NULL;\n\nAlso stream.opaque is not set, that does not look right to me but maybe that was an intentional bug?\n\nThe easy way to init a zstream is to memset it\n\n  memset(\u0026stream, 0, sizeof(stream));\n\nand that\u0027s what chrome users do (dunno why you do it differently).\nThen you call deflateInit(), and catch / deal with any error. Otherwise, hook up your buffers ...\n\n  stream.next_in \u003d input_buffer.data();\n  stream.avail_in \u003d size;\n  stream.next_out \u003d buffer;\n  stream.avail_out \u003d buffer_length;\n\nand call deflate(), and away you go.  They way you have done it in the fuzzers is not exactly canonical.",
