I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth trying to confirm that the code can change in this CL, but I think copying the comment is misleading.\n\n(If you actually have a doc pointer, please just point me at it rather than removing the comment.)",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think this works.  Mojo pointers are bound to the thread on which they are first used, and I think this pointer is likely to have been used on the UI thread.\n\nMore generally, one of the bonuses of shifting to Mojo is being able to use the client end of the Mojo pipe on a different thread than the server.  So conversion to Mojo can get rid of the \"Jump to IO thread, do cookie operation, jump back to the UI thread\" pattern that is common in our code.  So I think you can simplify this code and completely get rid of this function.",
