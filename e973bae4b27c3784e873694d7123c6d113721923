      "message": "What I mean is that we\u0027re only counting the number that are stale or orphaned. That excludes those which are for installed WebAPKs which haven\u0027t had an update successfully complete yet in the last day. I\u0027m more interested in the peak number of these files that are left around, so that means just recording the size of the |children| array. Since this method is called on web app startup (thanks for pointing that out), I\u0027m happy with this metric being recorded here as just the total number of update files.\n\nWDYT?",

My goal with the metric was to identify cases where the file does not get deleted when it should.\n\nI guess you want a metric which just records how many files there are in total? Personally, I don\u0027t think that the metric that you are suggesting is very actionable. In particular, the metric that you are suggesting will not tell us whether there are cases where the delete logic is not run",
