      "message": "Dominic and I discussed having these be marked as \"offscreen\" as a way to flag to Select-to-Speak that the element is not important. We choose to use this existing flag rather than add a new one for simplicity, even though the node location is onscreen it\u0027s not visible for users so \u0027offscreen\u0027 felt acceptable. More is in crbug.com/773851. \n\nThis was motivated by having some way to mark these nodes as not visible which is critical to Gmail usability with select-to-speak.\n\nMaybe we could all discuss in person how to handle elements of 0 size.",
