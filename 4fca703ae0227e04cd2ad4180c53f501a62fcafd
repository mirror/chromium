      "message": "When I add the dagger processor, (and leave in the other changes in the patch), chrome_java is not able to find org.chromium.base.BuildConfig anymore, and fails compiling because of that. I tried to reverse the processor list hoping that it was related to the order in which processors run but it does not seem to be the case...\nAny idea what I\u0027m missing?",

      "message": "You probably know this, but to to be overcommunication:\n* The only targets that currently use annotation processors are the robolectric ones\n* Errorprone uses processorpath to have its plugin discovered, but it isn\u0027t actually an annotation processor.\n\nBuildConfig.java is special in that it uses \"jar_excluded_patterns\" to exclude itself from being put into base_java\u0027s .jar. However, it will still exist in base_java\u0027s .inferface.jar.\n\nIt looks like there\u0027s logic above (_enable_interface_jars_javac) that toggles from interface.jar -\u003e .jar when an annotation processor is present.\n\nJust tried removing it and I get:\n\njava.lang.ClassFormatError: Absent Code attribute in method that is not native or abstract in class file com/google/auto/service/processor/AutoServiceProcessor\n\n\nThe stack doesn\u0027t have any robolectric classes, so I think all annotation processors are broken with interface jars.\n\nSo.....\n\nPossible fixes:\n 1 Change from interface .jars -\u003e Bazel\u0027s turbine (this is interface jars v2)\n 2 Create a third output for java_library: foo.classpath.jar\n 3 Change jar_excluded_patterns so that they are not applied until link-time\n\n3 is the best fix vs effort I think. I can look at adding it today.",
