But I\u0027m still not quite understanding your plan about them - do you want to eventually split those old topic-based groups into pairs of device-level and user-level groups? Or you want to touch only those that are referenced in the Help Article, making only those level+topic-grouped and keeping some policies topic-grouped? The latter sounds a bit inconsistent, although you maybe have a good argument for doing this :)",
