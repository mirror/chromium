E.g.\n\n  Currently, a toast only on ChromeOS public sessions shows when using the\n  html5 fullscreen API. It should also be shown when an app uses the\n  extension windowing API to go fullscreen. Fix by including \n  FULLSCREEN_TYPE_WINDOW_API in the types that trigger the toast and update\n  tests.",
