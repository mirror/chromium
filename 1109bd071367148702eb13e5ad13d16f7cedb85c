      "message": "One note is this _can_ throw an exception, but _theoretically_ never should.  It would signal a bug around unique_touch_event_id not being unique or incorrectly assuming that a gesture would not be created when in fact it was.  Is there a recommended way to handle these scenarios?\n\nEither way, we\u0027d have no way to route the event, as we wouldn\u0027t know where it should go.\n\nAlso, simply using [] would prevent the exception here, but then would cause oddness/exceptions later when trying to access the target property.",

      "message": "Scratch this one.  Based on some new commits, on Android there will be some gestures that aren\u0027t caused by touch, and won\u0027t be in the map.  Looks like the correct way forward is to check the map, and re-calculate the target if the key isn\u0027t found.",

      "message": "Gestures from a touchscreen device that are not associated with touch events should have unique_touch_event_id \u003d\u003d 0 (the documentation on WebGestureEvent says that, at least). This should be fine as long as we explicitly cover that case; the change that I landed yesterday directly hit tests (via FindEventTarget()) for those gestures.",
