I\u0027d think you\u0027d also want to add a Flush to the wait at line 448, or else the subsequent ASSERT isn\u0027t actually checking the return value it thinks it is (e.g. if you forcibly populated |consumer| with bogus results before that GetFormValuesForElementName() call, I think such a Flush would change the test from \"failure\" to \"success\").\n\nMaybe SetUpKeyValueData() also needs a Flush, or else everyone who calls it needs to Flush in their next WaitForBackgroundTasks.",
