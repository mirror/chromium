      "message": "I\u0027m trying to figure out the ramifications of our decision here. Some questions (somewhat overlapping concerns):\n\n1. Why shouldn\u0027t we set the colorspace in the SkImageInfo in an SkBitmap? Should we set it identically to the CopyOutputResult::color_space() property (sans type/API conversions)?\n\n2. Will client code be burdened with having to manually set the colorspace in an SkBitmap downstream (i.e., translate from the gfx::ColorSpace we provide separately)? In other words, is there code that uses and properly acts on the SkBitmap colorspace info such that it would be much more convenient to bundle it all within SkBitmap rather than SkBitmap+gfx::ColorSpace?\n\n3. With this, we will have two potential places to set the color space (in the SkBitmap image info versus in CopyOutputResult itself), but only one will be set. Are we okay with this? Should we attempt to set both, to make sure things don\u0027t silently break downstream when other developers use the wrong one?",
