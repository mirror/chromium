Does the next call when there are no files left return ACCESS_RESULT_SUCCESS then?\n\nIf so, then I agree that this should be fine. But please add some comments around this.\n\nOr better yet, can this be structured in a way that\u0027s easier to follow - e.g. with a standard loop that iterates the files in the directory?",
