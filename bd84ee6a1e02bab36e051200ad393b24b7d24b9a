(Aside: these could probably be packed better than they are; oh well.)\n\nAnother thought: should these all be invalidated at once, since they\u0027re all computed with an ancestor walk that could be done at once? Especially since FieldSetAncestorsSetNeedsValidityCheck already seems to do an ancestor walk that examines fieldsets. Something like:\n\nbool ancestor_state_is_current_ : 1;\n// These are only valid if |ancestor_state_is_current_| is true.\nbool has_data_list_ancestor_ : 1;\nbool has_fieldset_ancestor_ : 1;\nbool disabled_due_to_ancestor_ : 1;",
