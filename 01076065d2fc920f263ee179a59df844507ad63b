Doing this will break various other things inside Blink.\n\nCan you help me understand why this change is needed in Blink? Blink offsets have always been integers and you\u0027re doing the DIP adjustment above Blink in AndroidWebView code so I don\u0027t understand why we need to make this change.\n\nIt might be helpful if you show me the path from how LocalDOMWindow::scrollX|Y gets to SynchronousCompositor::DidChangeRootLayerScrollOffset. My assumption was that these values will all come from CC which has all the fractional parts of the scroll offset.",
