Could client code (like used here) be something like:\n\nhiding_settings.layer_animation_settings()-\u003eSetAnimationMetricsReporter(\n  AnimationMetricsReporter::GetReporter(\"Ash.Window.AnimationSmoothness.Hide\"))?\n\nI\u0027m not implying the code needs to be exactly this, just that having to subclass and maintain a lazy instance is heavy. Can\u0027t it be easier?",

      "message": "Thanks. Your suggestion would simplify the client a lot.\n\nTalked with varkha@ offline.\nI think the only concern when varkha@ introduced the reporter [1] is that because some animation is called so often, we try not interrupt with the animation and \"simplicity would win (and avoid some non-trivial instantiation and reconstitution costs for the histogram objects)\".\n\nActually we need to instance the reporter for every animation, and might need to create the histogram object for every animation. UMA_HISTOGRAM_PERCENTAGE will call base::LinearHistogram::FactoryGet. We do not know if the histogram object could be cached or not.\n\nBut on the other hand, we can simplify the override function to take Report(string uma_name, int value), so that we can only have one global AnimationMetricsReporter in ChromeOS? Not one lazy instance for each kind of reporter?\n\nWDYT? varkha@ could you please add more if I am missing something.\n\n[1] https://codereview.chromium.org/2631333002#msg62",
