      "message": "Actually, I\u0027d rather not affect any ellipsising behavior here..\n\nChanged to fixing the line-height here. It looks like this was happening because the line-height: 154% which was on for bookmarks-app is calculated against the shadow root boundary??\n\ni.e 154% is against the cr-toolbar\u0027s font-size which is 100%, rather than the h1\u0027s font-size which is 123%, so it comes up short. Something weird is happening here..\n\nI\u0027m setting line-height: normal here which makes MD Bookmarks and Settings match History. (This issue affects Settings in Hindi as well)",
