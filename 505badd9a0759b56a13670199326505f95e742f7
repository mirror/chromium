      "message": "Thanks for the explanation. So IIUC printer_manager_ does not invoke any asynchronous callbacks within this class, so it seems safe.\n\nHaving said that, the fact that this is called within RegisterMessages is confusing me. Presumably this is called here, because JS can call back to C++ (like HandleGetCupsPrintersList) and this function has to be already called by that time. Is that right? If so, could we simply move it in the constructor instead?",

      "message": "I believe that, as written, this could move to the constructor.\n\nHowever, I think the longer term intent is that we *will* invoke JS callbacks from this class to update the list of available printers based on changes in policy/network detections/usb events. So perhaps the right place for this is in OnJavascriptAllowed()?  I\u0027m not entirely familiar with the event semantics of webui classes.",
