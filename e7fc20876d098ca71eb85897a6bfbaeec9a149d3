      "message": "In this version both hotkeys work on all platforms, e.g. on Linux both Ctrl+Z and Windows+Z perform Undo, and on Mac both Ctrl+Z and Command+Z do it. If this is undesirable (since Meta is uncommon on Linux and Ctrl is odd for Mac), we need to do some platform checking, e.g. with |cr.isMac|. As I don\u0027t think it is possible to have conditionals in object literals, we need to perform the check somewhere else. For example, we could wrap the contents of onUndoKeyBinding_ in\n\n  if (cr.isMac \u003d\u003d event.detail.metaKey) {\n    ...\n  }\n\nThat way only the \"normal\" keybindings work. What do you think?",
