From the discussion on https://codereview.chromium.org/2921753002/diff/20001/chrome/browser/ui/browser_navigator.cc#oldcode362, I think the outcome is the same?\n\nDo we need params.source_site_instance anymore?  It looks like the only other use is GetSourceProfile, and I wonder if that could be handled with params.opener now?  (Just trying to clean it up if we can.)",
