From the discussion on https://codereview.chromium.org/2921753002/diff/20001/chrome/browser/ui/browser_navigator.cc#oldcode362, I think the outcome is the same?\n\nDo we need params.source_site_instance anymore?  It looks like the only other use is GetSourceProfile, and I wonder if that could be handled with params.opener now?  (Just trying to clean it up if we can.)",

      "message": "One potential problem is NavigatorImpl::RequestOpenURL [1] which A) sets source_site_instance, but B) doesn\u0027t set opener (and I think this is okay / I think that it is possible to trigger the OpenURL navigation path without being an opener, right?).  The new |opener| field will eventually (in the next CL) get surfaced via window.opener and will be used to infer the browsing instance boundaries in blink-side window.name-based frame lookups.\n\nFWIW, I\u0027ve created a separate, follow-up CL [2] that tries to remove |source_site_instance|, but based on the above I expect it to fail tryjobs.  OTOH, if it doesn\u0027t, then maybe we can pull/merge this other CL into the current CL under review?\n\nWDYT?\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/frame_host/navigator_impl.cc?rcl\u003d6c7dbec18f8ec23f6b146cd361016ee19db7732d\u0026l\u003d752\n\n[2] https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/chromium/src/+/759150",

      "message": "Hmmm... the other CL passed tryjobs (one layout test needs to have its expectations updated, but this seems fine [the test is testing an implementation rather than web-visible behavior - I had to already update it once when fixing middle-click process allocation]).\n\nBut - I think I\u0027d rather do the |source_site_instance| removal in a separate CL (to mitigate risk and not block the window.name lookup granularity fix).  FWIW, I\u0027ve chatted with Alex and he says that we should have enough coverage in this area to be relatively confident based on the green tryjobs.\n\nAt any rate - I plan to follow-up with further discussion in the other CL.  Does that sound good?",
