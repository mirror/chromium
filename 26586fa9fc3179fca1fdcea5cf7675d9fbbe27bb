      "message": "This would work great if notification setPriority and channel setImportance used the same constants to mean the same thing.\n\nHowever, priority ranges from -2 to 2, whereas channel importance goes from 0 to 5, so I think we risk bugs and unexpected behaviour on different platforms if we treat them as interchangeable.\n\nInstead, how about making this parameter just be about importance, and reinstate the setPriority method in ChromeNotificationBuilder, so that any code which creates a notification which needs a specific priority on older platforms must set both importance and priority explicitly.",
