And since specs don\u0027t actually operate on a per-frame level (since frames can script eachother) I need all the BlobURLStore connections for the same unit of related browsing context to be ordered relatively to eachother as well, which means they need to be associated with something that isn\u0027t per-frame, and thus the browser has no way of knowing what frame any connection actually belongs to without the renderer telling it.",

      "message": "Hrm. It needs to be impossible for a renderer to create a blob with arbitrary content and assign it to a distinct origin. If we can\u0027t do that, it will end up being a hole in site isolation\u0027s process separation mechanics (as origin1 can frame the fake-origin2, causing JS execution and therefore UXSS).\n\nI\u0027m unfortunately OOO this week; CCing Charlie and Alex, who will be able to give you feedback on the design.",
