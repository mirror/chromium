And since specs don\u0027t actually operate on a per-frame level (since frames can script eachother) I need all the BlobURLStore connections for the same unit of related browsing context to be ordered relatively to eachother as well, which means they need to be associated with something that isn\u0027t per-frame, and thus the browser has no way of knowing what frame any connection actually belongs to without the renderer telling it.",
