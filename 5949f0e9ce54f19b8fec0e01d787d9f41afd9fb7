      "message": "Would it make sense to move this to network-choose-mobile element (so the scan is done only if the cellular network is selected), or would that introduce too great of a delay for updating the found network list?\n\nAlso, should we re-scan when a cellular network is selected? If the network details dialog was shown for a while, network properties might already be stale when the cellular network is selected; do we care about this case?\n\nIf you think the rescan is best done here, than I\u0027m fine with it.",

      "message": "The scan identifies the list of networks to be selected. However we always show network-choose-mobile if scanning is supported (which we should probably check also) so I will move this to network-choose-mobile.\n\nThat also raises the question of what to do when the list is empty. I will go ahead and address as well.\n\nOn further consideration I think we can move all of the network selection handling to network-choose-mobile, so thanks for the suggestion :)",

      "message": "Here\u0027s the expected behavior:\n\n- The UI presents a \"Choose Mobile Network\" button\n- Only after the user clicks the button, the choose-mobile-network dialog pops up and initiates a scan\n- The scan may take a minute or two. An empty list could be present if the scan doesn\u0027t complete within the time limit.\n- The user can click the \"scan\" button to rescan\n- The user can choose a network from the list if it\u0027s not empty\n- The user can click cancel to close the dialog\n\nwe currently don\u0027t want to initiate any background scan, so the scan should only be triggered by users",

      "message": "So I still haven\u0027t addressed an empty list, I\u0027ll do that next, but:\n* I don\u0027t think we want a separate dialog.\n* We should indicate when scanning is active.\n* We should show something (\u0027scanning\u0027 or \u0027no networks\u0027) in the dropdown if the list is empty.\n* I don\u0027t think we want a \u0027scan\u0027 button. We initiate a scan when the user opens the UI; if we expect the results to change we could scan periodically (like we do for WiFi), otherwise scanning when the UI is opened should suffice.",
