      "message": "Do you want to avoid resampling when possible? I.e. can we construct a fuschia audio stream at any sample rate and it\u0027ll handle resampling? We do this on CrOS and Android for power saving reasons. If so you should check the input params and use that sample rate.\n\nDitto on buffer size. If fuschia doesn\u0027t care, prefer the input params one (if it\u0027s valid). See what AudioManagerWin does here. You may want to carry over other values (like effects) from the input params if they\u0027re valid too.\n\nThere\u0027s also a GetUserBufferSize() override that may be useful to plumb if you want.",

We need to account for the time it takes to call OnMoreData(). if we set pts \u003d zx_time_get() + min_delay_ns here, then we would be calling write with (pts - zx_time_get()) \u003c min_delay_ns, which means that we can\u0027t be sure that the mixer will get that data on time to be mixed for the specified PTS.

I don\u0027t think it\u0027s related to the total playback delay for the target device. E.g. on windows we use GetDevicePeriod(), which returns \"interval between periodic processing passes by the audio engine\". On Fuchsia fuchsia_audio_parameters.buffer_size is effectively the same thing. It\u0027s not related to the total presentation delay for the target device. Normally presentation delay will be many times higher than the period.\n\nbuffer_duration is essentially the interval between consecutive OnMoreData() calls, so it\u0027s maximum amount of time we can allow for each OnMoreData() call. Potentially we could use some fixed value (e.g. 2ms) instead of period duration. That would make this code more sensitive to timer error than necessary.\n\nIt might be better to rename AudioParamters::buffer_size to AudioParamters::period_size, to reflect the actual usage of that field.

The computed value is wrong on Windows and is unused by the \u003cvideo\u003e/\u003caudio\u003e path. I guess WebAudio uses it, but no one has noticed it\u0027s wrong on the dominant platform; the FromQPCValue() calculation is incorrect. So I guess it doesn\u0027t matter what you put here :)\n\n\u003caudio\u003e definitely uses |delay| though; it requires that it mean that audio provided ::Now() will be heard after |delay| elapses. I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s what |min_delay| is actually returning though per my above comment, so we may have a problem here.\n\nplayout_time was proposed at one point, but it didn\u0027t seem to work for the WebAudio folk. I don\u0027t recall the exact details here, but you can see the proposal and changes here https://codereview.chromium.org/2101303004/#msg68\n\nIn any case, what you have here doesn\u0027t represent playout time, it is not accounting for elapsed time. Hence I think you want to use Now() and StreamTime + BufferDuration - Now() as your delay. Since per your above statement Now() and stream time are on the same clock, delay_timestamp should just be Now() and delay the time remaining until buffer exhaustion. If delay goes negative you\u0027ll have to reset your stream time as you\u0027re doing above.\n\nMissed callbacks should technically be filling in the frames_skipped field, but I don\u0027t think anything aside from ChromeCast uses that.\n\nTypically the platform exposes a get_pts type functionality (See Android, Windows) for facilitating this calculation.
