      "message": "Maybe I misunderstand how these new objects will be used but it appears that you are serializing a packet based on |data| first and then trying to parse it. My suggestion is to directly try to parse |data| so you are testing inputs that your serializer would never generate.",

Should it merely check that ANY input can be parsed without crashes?\n\nDo you think I should also check the serializer? E.g., leave lines 14-17 intact, and just in line 20 pass the (data, data + size) vector to Parse instead of |buffer|.",
