      "message": "Where are these being moved from? These are things Android would discourage doing in general in favour of controlling initialisation paths more carefully so you don\u0027t need to discover this information in common code (since every Android component already knows whether it\u0027s an isolated process and what its process name is implicitly from how it was configured by the developer).\n\nI haven\u0027t looked into this CL in detail but I think it\u0027d be better not to put this kind of thing into base if there\u0027s a sensible way to avoid it..",

      "message": "getProcessName() is used on start-up in downstream (search for \"shouldSkipExtraction\").\n\nisIsolatedProcess() is moved from PureJavaExceptionReporter\n\nIn a previous iteration, we tried using a content provider to execute main-process-only logic on start-up, but the it was revealed that some OEMs start providers on background threads.\n\nIt would dramatically increase complexity to try and annotate every activity / service / etc. with this logic, and also be less compelling. E.g. resource extraction, legacy multidex, global exception handler, all make sense at a process-level, not on a per-component level.\n\nI added comments to say how we could use non-private APIs to accomplish these tasks, but I see no reason to do so unless we hit a problem, as the non-private APIs are slower.",
