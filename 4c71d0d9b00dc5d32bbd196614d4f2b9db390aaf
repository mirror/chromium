It is actually the tests that destroys the GcmService that we depend on too early.\n\nIMO, if we\u0027re going to make a conditional check to pass the tests for now, I would rather we simply check if the current execution environment is a test and simply not initialize the CryptAuthServices.\n\nThe correct solution is fixing the tests themselves to not destroy services out of order.",
