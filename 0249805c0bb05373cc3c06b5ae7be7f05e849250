      "message": "Matt: I\u0027d like your thoughts on this - and if you have a better suggestion. Offering static methods for testing makes me sad, as it usually highlights an opportunity to improve our hermeticism or testing - but I can also understand that we don\u0027t really have any way to plum the dependencies down.\n\nIn the context of a Servicified world, this seems untenable, so if there are iterative suggestions to be made now to improve it, that\u0027d be great. Alternatively, if you\u0027re comfortable with that being part of the Servification effort, rather than this, I can live with that.\n\n(Note: This is similar to the ProfileIOData method we have already, so further if there\u0027s a way you can see to combine these so we only have one method, that also seems desirable)",

      "message": "Post-servicification, things are likely to work in a similar fashion, sadly, unless someone dedicates time to figuring out a better way to do this - there\u0027s already a way to mock out URLLoaderFactories (The URLRequest constructor) on profile URLRequestContexts.\n\nSeems like the only better way to do things (in a full integration test) would be to make things replaceable at runtime, or have a standard way to override creation of portions of the network stack that work along the same fundamental lines as this method currently does (We could, for instance, pall a callback the URLRequestContextBuilder, or the URLRequestContext before first use, and have it manipulate it to its hearts content.  In a post-servicification world, we\u0027d be passing the NetworkContextParams instead, I guess, which isn\u0027t quite as powerful).\n\nOne option for just sharing code in this particular case (for the current code) would be to inject a CertVerifierFactory instead, and make both the IOThread and ProfileIOData use it (Possibly with a parameter identifying what they\u0027re creating it for), but not sure that gets us a whole lot.",

      "message": "Matt: That actually sounds like a really great idea! It also seems to fit with how I was thinking we might servificy some of this CT effort, which I\u0027ve been trying to dedicate background mental cycles to. If you decide to explore this route in the future as part of S13N, I\u0027d love to be a part of it - and if we (//net OWNERs) don\u0027t get to it before the April CT launch, I\u0027d love to revisit it and possibly drive that once I have more time. Naively, I think it\u0027d make a lot of my qualms about some of the testability of various cert-and-IO-thingies go away, which is why I\u0027m uncomfortably excited about the prospect - even with the NetworkContextParams limitations :)",
