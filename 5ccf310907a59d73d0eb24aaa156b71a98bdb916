      "message": "I think this is broken.  These Configure...() methods are meant to be callable any time by anyone, usually as part of ConfigureScene().  This leaving_web_vr_mode_ approach sets visibility properly on the mode change leaving WebVR, but would be incorrect on any subsequent call (unless I\u0027m missing something).\n\nUnit tests might not catch this currently, if they don\u0027t inadvertently induce an extra ConfigureScene() call.\n\nI think we need to use non-transient state here, similar to the states asserted by VrShell to the UI.  In this case, I think that\u0027d be something like \"previous_mode_\".  It would stay valid perpetually.",

      "message": "Could we separate the variables that are (1) pushed up by the owner of the UI, vs (2) generated by the UI, into separate code blocks with comments?  Things like web_vr_mode_, fullscreen_, etc., are basically const as far as the UI is concerned, and at any point, the UI can refresh itself according to that state.  Other variables are set and used by the UI, must be set at the right time in the right order, etc., and frankly scare me a lot.  If we can put them in a section, we can at least say \"be careful with these\".",
