Should I move it?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any particular reason to have it in content/ rather than in, say, chromeos/ (or chrome/browser/chromeos) other than being consistently co-located with the first platform-specific tracing agent that got added prior to the ARC one (i.e. etw_tracing_agent which is Windows-specific). There\u0027s also cros_tracing_agent, cast_tracing_agent and power_tracing_agent (BattOr) now; it feels odd to just specifically move the ARC one somewhere else, but maybe they should all be moved to chrome/?",
