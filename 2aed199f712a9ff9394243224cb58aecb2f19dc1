      "message": "This is the idea I started with because non-null frames makes perfect sense in our new model (and even for current \"sticky\" use cases).  The main problem is that current UGI model is only loosely associate with frames/document.  For example, saved UGTs are frame agnostic.  To be frank, I think current call-sites are confused about it, and I have plan to fix it (crbug.com/730690).  Since that could change some behavior around saved tokens and at least I will have to change lot of tests, I will make the change isolated from this no-op CL.",
