      "message": "This insetting to account for kLocationBarBorderThicknessDip probably shouldn\u0027t be done in fullscreen, since there is no location bar. But I couldn\u0027t tell from the bug whether UX have fully specified how this should appear in fullscreen (e.g. maybe it would be neat to inset by a scrollbars\u0027-thickness from the top as well as the side so the padding is the same). Maybe it\u0027s a good thing to demo/screencast in the meeting tomorrow. I toyed with it on ChromeOS and it doesn\u0027t look terrible, so this is probably fine to look at in a follow-up.",
