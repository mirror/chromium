      "message": "Do you mean only WM is allowed to see windows from other clients? I thought that was the case but found that when we do WindowTree::Embed, e.g. when we embed a renderer to the browser, that renderer is seeing browser\u0027s window (seems like only one of them tho) when we initialize the WindowTree for that new renderer and WindowTree::GetUnknownWindowsFrom (https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/services/ui/ws/window_tree.cc?type\u003dcs\u0026q\u003dwindow_tree.cc\u0026l\u003d1219) is being called. I\u0027m not sure if this is the intended behavior for embedding or a bug?",

      "message": "Connections established through an embed see the window they are embedded at. This window was created by the connection doing the embed. in the case of browser-renderer, the renderer sees the window it is embedded in (which is the window created by RenderWidgetHostViewAura). But I think this means I\u0027m wrong, we have to do what as you are saying. If there is no high-word use id_.",
