      "message": "Rather than keep a list of channels that *shouldn\u0027t* be created on startup, and removing them from the list returned here, I think it would be clearer to maintain a set of startup channels, which is a subset of the ids in PredefinedChannels.MAP, and add channels to that in the static block above as well as to the map. More LOC but easier to see what\u0027s going on. This is how sfiera@ has done it in their in-progress CL here: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/581290/3/chrome%252Fandroid%252Fjava%252Fsrc%252Forg%252Fchromium%252Fchrome%252Fbrowser%252Fnotifications%252Fchannels%252FChannelDefinitions.java#68 \n\n(sfiera@ is adding a new channel for Content Suggestions, which also should not be initialized on startup.. So right now you are both adding code to allow non-startup channels with slightly different approaches, and I think I prefer the approach in crrev/c/581290, but I don\u0027t know when that patch will land. Either way, one of you is going to get conflicts, so you might want to co-ordinate!)",
