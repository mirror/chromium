      "message": "The helper puts commands into the command buffer. The GpuControl implementation sends messages to the service. One of these messages is flush which flushes the command buffer but there are others for creating command buffers (contexts), transfer buffers, etc.\n\nSo to answer your question, the SendGpuFence message will be processed before the flush that contains the CreateGpuFenceINTERNAL command. If I\u0027m reading the service side code correctly, this will fail because the client_id is not registered.\n\nI\u0027d recommend using an IPC for the entire thing like CreateImage does.",

      "message": "Actually this behavior is exactly what I want - SendGpuFence will register the client_id as a side effect, and the CreateGpuFenceINTERNAL(client_id, /*is_external\u003d*/true) call here is basically just a no-op with a DCHECK to confirm that it\u0027s already registered, and could be omitted entirely.\n\nThe important bit is that any following helper_-\u003eWaitGpuFenceCHROMIUM on this client_id will happen after the SendGpuFence got processed, and it sounds like that\u0027s the case.",
