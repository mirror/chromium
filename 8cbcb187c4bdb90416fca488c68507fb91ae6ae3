I think S13nSW is going to need the BLOB code path when NetworkService is disabled.\n\nIt looks like we\u0027re going to want to ship S13nSW before NetworkService... so I agree we should start making the independent S13nSW flag because we might have made assumptions that S13nSW is on iff NetworkService is on.",
