      "message": "This seems really risky to me.  You all know this particular code better than I do, but I\u0027ve seen lots of bugs (including a release-blocking use-after-free bug I\u0027m working on right now) due to asynchronous deletion.  If snapshot_controller_ has any way to continue accessing deleted state before this deletion task runs, we\u0027ll have big problems (potentially security bugs).\n\nIf you\u0027re certain that it\u0027s safe, can you include a comment above explaining why?",

      "message": "Charlie, did you mean deleted state of BLO? or something else?\n\nI can only see a scenario, where there is more posted tasks queued for snapshot controller ahead of delete, in which case BLO::StartSnapshot may be called a few more times, but state being reset, that should not be a problem.\n\nHearing the above, we could call something like snapshot_controller_-\u003eStop() or Reset() to ensure we don\u0027t Start another snapshot. It would be safer then.",
