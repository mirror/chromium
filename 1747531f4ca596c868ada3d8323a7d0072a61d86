      "message": "This seems really risky to me.  You all know this particular code better than I do, but I\u0027ve seen lots of bugs (including a release-blocking use-after-free bug I\u0027m working on right now) due to asynchronous deletion.  If snapshot_controller_ has any way to continue accessing deleted state before this deletion task runs, we\u0027ll have big problems (potentially security bugs).\n\nIf you\u0027re certain that it\u0027s safe, can you include a comment above explaining why?",
