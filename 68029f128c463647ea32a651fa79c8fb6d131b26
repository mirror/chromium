      "message": "Actually I don\u0027t think we do run tests on Jellybean, at least not on the main waterfall. Think we start at KitKat.\n\nBut you\u0027re right this constant is officially only available since API 19. But it seems like it was present in Jellybean pre-Mr1, it was just hidden before 19, like a lot of the other notification extras. I have added a special getter for it which suppresses lint, copying what we do for all the other notification extras in our tests.",
