      "message": "Ok, now I feel like I can understand this class.  I think the extra iterators are wordy, but it\u0027s a lot easier to read the logic, in my opinion.\n\nI feel like there\u0027s like four variables too many in this class.  It seems like the unique pieces of information here are:\n  PaintOpBuffer*\n  offsets\n  size_t current offset index\n\n....right? ++ just increments the offset index.  If the offset index is bigger than the number of offsets, you\u0027re at the end.  And the current PaintOp is buffer_-\u003edata() + offsets[index]?\n\nI\u0027m not sure I\u0027m following what the difference is between op_offset and target_offset.",
