      "message": "When these were left in common_param_traits_macros.h, then included in webplugininfo.typemap, we got dependencies on //ui when building the mojo targets (due to the includes in common_param_traits_macros.h). That meant we had to change visibility rules and introduce more tricks for component builds. This was far simpler.",
