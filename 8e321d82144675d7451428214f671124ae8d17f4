      "message": "I\u0027m not either, but in this case it seemed like the cleanest way.\n\nThe issue here is that many pages are taken from top_pages.py. So these pages need a mechanism for introducing scrolling logic, which should be compatible with the mechanism used for the custom pages defined in this file.\n\nUsing a mixin to add this functionality seemed like a good choice.\n\nOther options could be to manipulate instances of those classes directly by adding methods. Or this logic could be pushed further up into Page.",
