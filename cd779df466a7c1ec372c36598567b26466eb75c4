I see the image_animation_count.h comments and I understand what\u0027s going on, but this took a little to digest.  Can you maybe leave some comments on repetition_count_?  The comment there says \"The number of animation loops requested for this image\" which without reading that other header file would make me think that 0 would mean \"no loops\" and not \"1 loop\".",
