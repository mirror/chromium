      "message": "Going recursively through all files may be very heavy. Could you measure performance with eg. linux kernel unpacked (https://github.com/torvalds/linux/archive/master.zip). I usually use it for testing these kind of things.\n\n\nIf the performance is bad, we could use different strategy. On Chrome OS files go through storage:: APIs, so we could maintain a database of latest accesses without a need for a rescan.",
