      "message": "Going recursively through all files may be very heavy. Could you measure performance with eg. linux kernel unpacked (https://github.com/torvalds/linux/archive/master.zip). I usually use it for testing these kind of things.\n\n\nIf the performance is bad, we could use different strategy. On Chrome OS files go through storage:: APIs, so we could maintain a database of latest accesses without a need for a rescan.",

      "message": "Could you check some popular board with average specs? Things are usually performing well on Samus :). Is the system still responsive during the scan time? If so, then it shouldn\u0027t be that bad at least for the time being. But if the system becomes unusable, then IMHO we should rethink the solution, or cut corners, like stop scanning after 10k files or so.",
