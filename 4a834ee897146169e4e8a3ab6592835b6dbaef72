I\u0027ll do so.\n\n(But may take a bit of time; I expected this to be a piece-of-cake task that can be done in a second without eating my time for M62-blocker tasks, but apparently it turned out to require a more serious care and time :p)",

      "message": "As I checked, the event sequence of OnWindowFocused and OnWindowRemovingFromRootWindow is same.\n\nActually, OnWindowRemovingFromRootWindow is called only when an arc window is moved among displays, and is never called for notifications (since notifications can\u0027t moved among windows keeping the focus). When I added this change, IIRC OnWindowRemovingFromRootWindow was called when the notification was closed.",
