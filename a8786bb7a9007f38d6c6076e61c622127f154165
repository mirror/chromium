      "message": "My understanding is that rather than parameterize the app name in generated_resources.grd we\u0027re supposed to add separate strings to each of chromium_strings.grd and google_chrome_strings.grd.  (Many pre-existing strings still do it the old way.)  I guess this is easier for l10n.\n\nI don\u0027t know if there\u0027s anything special about accessibility strings that would make this different, though.",

      "message": "AFAIK it\u0027s for all strings that can contain \"Chrome\" vs. \"Chromium\" at all.  I don\u0027t fully know why, I think maybe because in some contexts the words surrounding those names will be translated differently for different names?  (Silly hypothetical, imagine that whether the next word should begin with a vowel depends on whether this word ends in one; then if we just have one string we sub Chrome vs. Chromium into it can\u0027t be translated correctly in both cases)\n\nYou might want to verify with a true l10n expert what the guidance on those files\u0027 usage is, though.  And if you find out the definitive rule tell me :)",
