I guess if we really want to cover that case, we can add it back in chrome code. You think this case is important enough?\n\n\u003e There\u0027s also some tolerance for quick back\u003c-\u003eforward. I\u0027m pretty sure this predates moderate binding so perhaps it\u0027s still ok to do :/\n\nYou mean quick back/forward shouldn\u0027t change the importance of the final visible renderer? 1s seems pretty low for that..\n\nAnyway, this case is covered with the new Importance thing. (roughly) all renderers belonging to a WebContents get its importance.",
