      "message": "AIUI, this code here is only a stopgap since the pre-paint tree walk does not have\nan \"NG\" mode. I agree that it seems that is the right way to implement it in the long term.\nPlease add a comment saying something like\n\nTODO(): This code copies VisualRects from the LayoutObject tree. We should \nimplement the pre-paint tree walk on the NGPaintFragment tree, and save this work.",
