The visual rect takes into account clips between local and\ndisplay item list space.\n\nAlso, I wouldn\u0027t say they are competing - rather the record_bounds is a technicality for the purpose\nof optimizing skia, and hopefully will go away at some point. The other is necessary for paint\ninvalidation and rtrees.",

      "message": "Oh ok, so it has clips and transforms. I say competing because given the knowledge of the global clips transforms (which are also in the display list), we could use the record_bounds in place of the visual rect for the rtree. Maybe not for paint invalidation, unless we invalidated based on PaintOps instead of based on geometry. I\u0027ve modified this comment to add your knowledge.",
