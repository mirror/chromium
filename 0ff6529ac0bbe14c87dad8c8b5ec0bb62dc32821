      "message": "Drive-by comment: Could we have the model check its own has_focus() in SetInputInProgress() to decide whether to call the notify method instead of telling it not to and then separately asking it to notify here?\n\nMore generally, this method seems a little odd to me (even before this change but this exacerbates the issue). It implements a back-and-forth where the view asks the model questions about the model\u0027s state and then based on that tells the model to do things.\n\nI feel like we could change this method to consist of nothing but a single call to SetInputInProgress and let the model decide when and whether to notify. The logic depends on the selection range but that\u0027s accessible to the model via OmniboxView::GetSelectionBounds.\n\nIt\u0027s not quite that simple since there are other calls to SetInputInProgress that would be affected by the proposed change but I think they could be accommodated solely via changes within the model itself. An additional advantage to simplifying the method here is that OmniboxViewMac has a parallel method with the exact same logic. Simplifying it rather than making it more complex would reduce the maintenance burden and reduce the chance that we neglect to keep them in sync.\n\nI\u0027m not suggesting that this necessarily should be done by you or in this CL, but I\u0027m curious as to your thoughts.",

      "message": "I\u0027m really nervous about this change.  I think we\u0027ll end up having a current_match() at times we shouldn\u0027t.  (I think it\u0027ll follow us around tab changes and such.)  Can you please split this change off into a separate changelist so we can discuss in depth?\n\nFor one, I\u0027d like clear repro steps, e.g., a set of actions that cause more StartAutocomplete() actions that you\u0027d expect.  The current bug does not have them.  Please start a new bug for it, so we can discuss whether there is an issue, and then whether this simple fix is the right solution.",
