      "message": "Is OnImplicitAnimationsCompleted guaranteed to be called? That\u0027s absolutely not obvious from the code. Otherwise it would leak the DeferredPaintObserver.\n\nIn particular, it looks to me that ~ScopedLayerAnimationSettings will remove it from animator_-\u003eobservers_, and so I don\u0027t think anything else will destroy it at that point.\n\nThe same is true of CacheRenderSurfaceObserver... I\u0027m super uncomfortable with the pattern, I would prefer if ScopedLayerAnimationSettings kept explicit ownership (unique_ptr) of the observers.",
