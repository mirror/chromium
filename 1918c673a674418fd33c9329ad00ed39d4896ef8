In theory, there are multiple video drawn next to next, but it\u0027s rare.\nBTW, new CL looks more complicated in my opinion, because it creates new exception which doesn\u0027t batch TextureDrawQuad.\n\n\u003e In general, I want to kill off uniform indexed quad batching -- it was an optimization added in the distant past for 9-patch textures only, and really doesn\u0027t help.\n\nIt can reduce number of drawElement call by 9 times in theory. That\u0027s huge benefit in my opinion, because glDrawElement causes expensive validation check under the gpu driver.",

      "message": "Batching only occurs when we use the same texture on all 9 quads, which excludes using this for multiple video quads or tiles (seriously ... it was an extremely short-sighted optimization ... just writing a custom shader for 9-patch layers would have been more effective and less complex).",
