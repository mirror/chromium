      "message": "For video quads, we should only be issuing 1 quad per draw call, so we shouldn\u0027t have to know the quad index. Can you update the patch to avoid using batched draws when has_texture_clamp_rect_ is true?\n\nIf you do that, then you won\u0027t need to pass the quad index as a varying -- there will always only be 1 quad.\n\nIn general, I want to kill off uniform indexed quad batching -- it was an optimization added in the distant past for 9-patch textures only, and really doesn\u0027t help.",
