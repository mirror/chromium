This copies the current spv1 clip applied at https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/paint/ScrollableAreaPainter.cpp?rcl\u003d8cfb6c74d5ece32d20f601781a8e8eae002ecd43\u0026l\u003d176. Also the rect is checked against the integer geometries of scrollbar frame rects.\n\nAny idea?",

Overflowing overflow controls seem very rare (I saw them only in layout tests). The drawback is more CPU cost here for the common case. Will schedule performance try jobs.",
