      "message": "Yeah actually. I had started that at one point and it was a fail for some reason. That was way early in the patch though so stuff probably changed.\n\nOnBeforeRequest does take ownership of request body data though so this method still uses a non-const request.\n\nA future cleanup could resolve this by making pre-processed request body data a separate arg to OnBeforeRequest, but that would require lots of additional noise in this CL to update all the call sites in tests.",
