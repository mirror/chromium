Local modification: create a pyfakefs as a project folder & move pyfakefs to
pyfakefs/pyfakefs since we don't want the project folder to be a module.
Add license header to pyfakefs/setup.py

Description:
pyfakefs implements a fake file system that mocks the Python file system
modules. Using pyfakefs, your tests operate on a fake file system in memory
without touching the real disk. The software under test requires no modification
to work with pyfakefs.
