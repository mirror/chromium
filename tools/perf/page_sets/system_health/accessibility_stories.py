We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain
unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the
pursuit of Happiness.

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That
whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it
is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute
new Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and
organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely
to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established
should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly
all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer,
while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the
forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a design
to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is
their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards
for their future security.
