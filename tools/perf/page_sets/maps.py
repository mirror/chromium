  """Google Maps benchmarks and pixel tests.

  The Maps team gave us a build of their test (basic_performancetest). The
  only modification to the test was to config.js, where the query argument
  "nobudget=true" was removed. The files were served up on localhost on
  port 8000.

  Below, "http://map-test" was replaced with "http://localhost:8000". The
  WPR was then recorded with:

  tools/perf/record_wpr smoothness_maps --browser=system

  This produced maps_???.wprgo, maps_???.wprgo.sha1 and maps.json.

  Telemetry no longer allows replaying a URL that refers to localhost. The
  archive then needs to be updated via:

  TODO(kbr): need https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult/issues/3787
  fixed and a command line to invoke web_page_replay_go's httparchive to
  remap localhost:8000 to map-test in the recorded archive

  After updating the host name in the WPR archive, or recording a
  newly-numbered WPR archive, please remember to update
  content/test/gpu/gpu_tests/maps_integration_test.py (and potentially
  its pixel expectations) as well.

  To upload the maps_???.wprgo to cloud storage, one would run:

    depot_tools/upload_to_google_storage.py --bucket=chromium-telemetry \
    maps_???.wprgo
