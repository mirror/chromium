      "message": "This is partly the reason GetWidgetImportanceForTesting now calls ComputeEffectiveImportance instead of just returning effective_importance_.\n\nWith the change to not store importance in WebContentsImpl, importance is plumbed down immediately on WebContentsImpl::Init. At that point, there is no child_process_launcher_, so UpdateProcessPriority is skipped. Then on desktop UpdateProcessPriority is skipped yet again here when process is launched. So in the test, immediately after first navigation, effective_importance_ is not updated.\n\nI ran into https://crbug.com/560446 before, and the proposed fix is introducing an entirely different system to prioritize processes, so going to take awhile..",
