      "message": "IIUC at this point in the rules the distinction is minimal but technically I think we should be using the configuration under which the rule is currently being evaluated, which is \"current\" - the \"target\" is, I think, only different from \"current\" in the BUILDCONFIG, where we need to understand the host and target toolchain properties.\n\nBut having read the GN docs I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m still not really sure.",
