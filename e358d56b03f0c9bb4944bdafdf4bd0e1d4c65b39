      "message": "BrowserThread::FILE is the thing we want to get rid of not BrowserThread::PostTaskAndReply() (my bad hadn\u0027t realized BrowserThread::FOO could be misinterpreted as those other methods).\n\nWhat the existing code was doing is post a task to the file thread and then run |callback| back on the current sequence (e.g. IO thread if that is the calling thread in your case -- ref. SequencedTaskRunnerHandle::Get())\n\nSo what you want here is to include base/task_scheduler/post_task.h and use:\n\nbase::PostTaskAndReplyWithTraits(FROM_HERE, {base::MayBlock(), base::TaskPriority::BACKGROUND}, base::Bind(...), callback);",
