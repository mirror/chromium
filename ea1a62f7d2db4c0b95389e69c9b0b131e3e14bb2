The top functionality is only used when presenting the sign in view controller and the identity manager is up.\n\nSo, this would make the top function happen for all cases. It should not be a behavior change, since present should not be called if presentingVC is not the top VC anyway.\n\nAssuming this change is ok, I will remove this API.",

The view controllers that are presented can try to present their own VCs, but won\u0027t be able to because they are already presented over.\n\nSo, I think we should keep separate APIs so that the interaction controller can use top just when it needs to present a sign in controller.\n\nOne improvement that we can make is to make an API that is for presenting just the SignInInteractionController. This API will take in as one of its params whether the ChromeIdentityManager is presenting, and if so, it will present on top.",
