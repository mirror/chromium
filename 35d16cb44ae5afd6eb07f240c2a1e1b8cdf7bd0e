      "message": "WakeUps may still be requested by an dedicated SingleThreadTaskRunner. Because STTR\u0027s directly work with their SchedulerWorkers, they don\u0027t have a notion of a started or stopped SchedulerWorker. \n\nThe only component that knows the Started state is the SingleThreadTaskRunnerManager, which does not keep track of SingleThreadTaskRunners by design because maintain a strong ref would basically \"leak\" the STTR when the last external reference was released. As a result, it cannot notify STTRs of the Started state and we have to no-op WakeUps when SchedulerWorker isn\u0027t started.",
