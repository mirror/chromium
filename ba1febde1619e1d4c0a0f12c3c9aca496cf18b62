      "message": "We discussed this in person, and I think we\u0027re on the same page now, but I did write out the details below:\n\nI think it needs to be created and be a long-living object similar to the other coordinators which listen to their own dispatch command protocols (e.g. TabHistoryCoordinator). The reason being that because the coordinator/dispatcher pattern is loosely-coupled, there isn\u0027t necessarily a connection between a triggering event and the coordinator itself, just the dispatcher.\n\nIn the proposed alternative scenario - ToolBarController would get an action from the menu button, and create a Coordinator directly, but would need to know about the BVC which has critical information for the Coordinator (so a class which is hierarchically more a leaf - the Toolbar - would have to have a pointer to a more root class, the BVC). This could however be achieved more cleanly with a delegate protocol which the BVC would conform to, and this is similar to what I\u0027ve done in the next revision where the MenuCoordinator is owned by the ToolbarCoordinator but still has a pointer to the BVC for delegate callbacks.\n\nSecondly, if it was desired that the tools popup were triggered from another part of the UI other than the toolbar menu, the Coordinator and the plumbing for all of its delegates would have to be recreated, rather than a single call to the dispatcher for a coordinator that was already set up.\n\nIt\u0027s also worth noting that if we did not have a dispatcher pattern to adhere to, it would lead us to do something more like what you suggest I think, just instantiate a view controller (and/or Coordinator) at triggering time (or use a shared object). I think this is worthy for some discussion as a group (i.e. what are the use-cases for the dispatcher pattern).",

      "message": "Just to respond to this -- I think the tools menu is conceptually a prime candidate for \"local presentation\", where the most proximate parent object (in this case, the toolbar) is responsible for creating, starting, and owning it. However, as you point out, the current implementation of the tools menu requires a significant delegate hook-up that we\u0027d prefer not to re-plumb in all possible locations.\n\nThis leads nicely into the question of what dispatch is for. The dispatcher is best used for the invocation of \"non-local\" UI -- for example, most of the actions triggered from the tools menu won\u0027t be local to it, and their actual locations in the UI are likely to vary independently of the tools menu, so they are a good fit for handling via dispatch. \n\nI\u0027m fine with both the BVC owning the tools menu coordinator, and that coordinator handling its own invocation commands for now, since we\u0027re not yet in a place where we can do things differently.",

      "message": "I share your instincts :-). We\u0027ve discussed this a little in person, but to document:\n\nWhen I started this refactor I tried to move away from notifications to have a single presentation delegate for the coordinator with four willShow/didShow/willHide/didHide methods. \n\nThere are two main reasons I didn\u0027t finish with that approach:\n\n1. There are two objects which directly configure the tools popup when they are notified about the presentation of its presentation: the BVC and the ToolsController.\n\nBoth need to do important things when they hear about a popup coming or going:\n\n• BVC configures other views, such as dismissing omnibox UI or ending editing states\n• ToolbarController sets the visibility of the tools button so that it matches the presentation of the tools popup.\n\nOne thought is to combine these into one delegate object, but the ToolbarController cannot be it because it would need information from the BVC which is higher in the hierarchy and it seems counter-productive to make a change that more tightly couples those classes. \n\nBVC is a better choice, we will need to expose a button from ToolbarController to the BVC, a button which is currently not a publicly exposed property. This seems like a small tradeoff to have all configuration code in one place, and so I have done this in the next revision.\n\n2. We already have other parts of the application dependent on didShow/didHide notifications. For example the FullScreen and Overscroll components (I have just renamed the notifications slightly in this refactor, but they are not a new concept); so we cannot remove the notifications altogether without a more significant refactor, and it seems to me to be a bad tradeoff to implement both a delegate pattern and have notifications for presentation events if we can help it.\n\nLet me know if I\u0027ve misunderstood anything here!",

      "message": "IMHO the delegate pattern is desired because we want to maintain the insulation from objects like BVC to be directly triggering the presentation of the tools menu - rather, any object can request the presentation via the dispatcher (which I believe is the goal of the dispatcher pattern here - to allow for greater decoupling - although I know there\u0027s a discussion to be had about the use of dispatcher with coordinators in this manner). Despite any object being the source of the event that triggers presentation, the Coordinator needs to find discover configuration details from its delegate at a time that\u0027s appropriate to it (rather than have these values pushed to it).\n\nGiven that we have a delegate pattern that is desirable(?) for the above reasons, how do we inform the object that the configuration should change or be updated?\n\nHere we are calling directly onto the Coordinator to refresh, and I think that\u0027s ok and comparable with the mechanisms that other \u0027dataSource\u0027 or \u0027delegate\u0027 objects do to trigger a refresh in their delegators - e.g. UITableView\u0027s reloadData method.\n\nSo this update relationship between the delegator and the delegate has common precedence and works well. In the presence of the dispatcher pattern it\u0027s tempting to think there\u0027s an argument to be made that an update method should exist on the dispatcher object, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s correct unless absolutely necessary. This delegate/update issue is a convention between a delegate and delegator, and should be seen as separate from triggers to present and dismiss the UI through the dispatcher. I think we should resist adding an update method to the dispatcher protocol unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\nLet me know if I\u0027ve misunderstood!",

      "message": "To avoid truncating a long pointer to an incorrect BOOL value. I.e. on the off-chance you get a pointer with all lower value bits set to \u00270\u0027, just returning that pointer as a BOOL will truncate the higher level bits and essentially return \u0027NO\u0027 when it should return \u0027YES\u0027.\n\nI think I\u0027m right in that this is a case where such a problem could occur.\n\nAlthough the bang-bang is not unusual for this situation (https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q\u003dreturn+!!\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026type\u003dcs), I\u0027m always happy to make this more readable, e.g. \u0027return toolsPopupController_ ? YES : NO\u0027, or as Ed says \u0027return toolsPopupController_ !\u003d nil;\u0027. Let me know!",
