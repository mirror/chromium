      "message": "The version of neon-animated-pages in third_party is not recent enough, meaning that it is not using \u003cslot\u003e internally, see https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/polymer/v1_0/components-chromium/neon-animation/neon-animated-pages.html?l\u003d51.\n\nI am guessing that this still works? Can you verify? Perhaps it is safer to migrate Polymer elements first, before updating our code (which builds on them). WDYT?",
