      "message": "High-level question: how do we make sure this doesn\u0027t break in the future, say if a new enum value gets added. Are there ways to test for this? Or can we add compile-time asserts about this enum matching the order in the CSSProperties enum, along the lines of STATIC_ASSERT_MATCHING_ENUM, which we use in a few places? (the asserts would have to go somewhere in Blink, since code in cc can\u0027t use the CSSProperties enum)",
