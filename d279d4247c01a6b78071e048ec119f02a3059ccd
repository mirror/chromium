      "message": "Oh, wait, the clamping is at 2^31. But I guess the previous behavior was because of integer wrapping at the IDL level. In any case, finding the number around 2^32 that results in \u00272147483647\u0027 would be interesting. Or if I\u0027m wrong, there still has to be something interesting happening around 2^32 for it to be worth testing.",
