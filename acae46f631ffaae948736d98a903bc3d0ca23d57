      "message": "Since this is autogenerated I think it may belong in third_party.\nI think it still needs a copyright header.\n\nTypically files like this also have a message at the top\nsaying something like \"Autogenerated file, DO NOT EDIT\".\n\nI think the bigger issue here is that this isn\u0027t really open-source\nas-is now - someone external to Google doesn\u0027t have the ability to\nmodify this model and regenerate this file.\n\nIs tfnative public / open-source? If so, would it be possible\nto check in the source that generates this code? Even if we don\u0027t\ncheck in the training data, checking in the source model and\nbuild instructions would allow someone to regenerate this file.\n\nAnother option is to check this into src-internal, then maybe\nChromium could skip the tfnative step, but Google Chrome could\nlink to the neural net.",

      "message": "I added the general copyright notice and do not edit message.\n\ntfNative is not open source, hence I think we cannot check in the code here.\n\nI think this is a temporary solution until tfLite is added to Chrome and at that point we would be able to use that instead of this code.\nConsidering this, can we keep it here (not move it to src-internal) and just add a TODO to be replaced with tfLite when it comes in?",
