      "message": "I\u0027m still shaky on c++ style, but the interaction between done_cb_, is_pending_, and cb passed around) is a little confusing here and in SendPacket above.\n\nIf done_cb_ is set to a new closure here, how can it be null for the next SendPacket call (on line 28)?\n\nis_pending_ seems to imply that done_cb_ is not null, but then we set it to false below on line 56.\n\n\nApologies if I\u0027m missing something obvious. :)",
