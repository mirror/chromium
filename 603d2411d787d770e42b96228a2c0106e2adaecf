It\u0027s only called here and it\u0027s two lines, and the name is mildly confusing (I\u0027d expect it to either remove another cursor, or to be called RemoveFromTransaction / UnregisterFromTransaction). Either way, the version of the code with the inlined body seems more straightforward to me.",
