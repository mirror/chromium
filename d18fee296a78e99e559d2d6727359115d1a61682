That seems wrong - surely if I load the same content on two devices, which have the same screen size in DIPs but different DSF, I should not see one of them autosized and the other not autosized.\n\nThis already existed before your change but perhaps you could add a TODO comment explaining that the behavior expected by these tests (specifically the split between ClusterHasNotEnoughTextToAutosizeForZoomDSF and ClusterHasEnoughTextToAutosizeForZoomDSF) is questionable.",
