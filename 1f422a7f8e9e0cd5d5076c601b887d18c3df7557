      "message": "here and below:\nI don\u0027t feel a readability improvement from having the default arguments here.  (I looked at the code before making this comment.)  And the style guide lists a downside:\n\u003e Default parameters are re-evaluated at each call site, which can bloat the generated code.\n\nIf you feel strongly that this improves readability, I won\u0027t object.  But I feel for single-parameter setter functions having a default is unnecessary, and, given the quotation above, might as well be avoided.\n\n(The situation is made somewhat more confusing because you have your defaults always set to true.  This does help with understandability--set_XXX makes sense to default to true--but is confusing given only in some of these cases does the value in the the default AutocompleteInput constructor default to true and sometimes it defaults to false.)",
