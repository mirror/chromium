      "message": "As we chatted offline, if we always do this we\u0027ll break the regular network loading path unless we do:\n* Add support to get a data pipe from a Blob and pass it instead (or temporarily allow broken dependency from network -\u003e storage), and\n* Add support to create net::UploadDataStream from a given data pipe\n\nIf we both of these the entire code will be really cleaner, I believe.\n\nAlternative (hacky) approach we talked is to take this path only for ServiceWorkerSubresourceLoader cases, which can be done by:\n* Get a mojom::Blob from request.HttpBody and attach the blob to the request (WebURLRequest) as a extra data field in WebServiceWorkerNetworkProvider::CreateURLLoader\n* Go through this path (i.e. attach the request_body as a blob) only when we have the extra data field here",
