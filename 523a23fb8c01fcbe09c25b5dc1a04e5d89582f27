Inputs (like cflags and defines) apply from the target and the configs that apply on that target.\n\nThe way I would expect it to work is to not have any code here, and to not have an inputs_ member on the Target object. When you need to know what the inputs are use code like we have on the flags to iterate over the applying ConfigValues in the correct order.",
