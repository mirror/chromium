Inputs (like cflags and defines) apply from the target and the configs that apply on that target.\n\nThe way I would expect it to work is to not have any code here, and to not have an inputs_ member on the Target object. When you need to know what the inputs are use code like we have on the flags to iterate over the applying ConfigValues in the correct order.",

      "message": "Yeah, that seems a lot cleaner for binary targets. Done.\n\nIt feels a bit awkward to do actions in this way, since the vibe I got was that config_values are generally only populated for binary targets. That said, doing `if (IsBinary()) { /* iterate through target and its configs */ } else {  /* iterate over target.action_values.inputs() or similar */ }` seems way more bug-prone, and wrapping all of that into some kind of custom TargetInputsIterator feels like a lot.",
