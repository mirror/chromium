Is there a reason this is the only one that needs to change?

      "message": "\u003e could the task manager end up showing the wrong title?\n\nThe task manager would not show the \"wrong\" title, per se. It would show the same title as what you see in the tabstrip (prefixed by \"Tab: \"). This, and more generally all UI surfaces agreeing on the title for a tab, seems like a good thing.\n\n\u003e I worry about future code as well, since it\u0027s not obvious that callers have to wait until loading stops before they can query the title.\n\nThey don\u0027t have to wait until loading stops. Previously, if called before loading was finished, they might have gotten a URL or an actual title. Now, if called before loading is finished, they might get the last page\u0027s url/title, or the current page\u0027s title. Most callers should probably override TitleWasSet anyway to keep up with title changes.\n\nThe docs for GetTitle seem to have been written for some other (past?) function and not at all relevant to the current GetTitle, so I agree that should be updated.",
