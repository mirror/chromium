      "message": "There are a lot of callers to WebContents::GetTitle(), which makes me wonder how many other ones might have this same problem.  Is there a reason this is the only one that needs to change?  (For example, could the task manager end up showing the wrong title?)\n\nI worry about future code as well, since it\u0027s not obvious that callers have to wait until loading stops before they can query the title.  If we continue, we should at least update the documentation for GetTitle in web_contents.h.",
