      "message": "That\u0027s unintentional, good catch. I don\u0027t think it makes a web-visible difference since we should never return null except possibly in some shutdown cases that shouldn\u0027t be visible to JS anyway. I did some testing and changing the Chrome IDL didn\u0027t change behaviour of setting here either.\n\nI think we should change to match the spec since we should never return a null visualViewport (and this matches some of the other attributes like `screen`) so I have a fix in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/550262/. I\u0027ll land that first and then land this after.",
