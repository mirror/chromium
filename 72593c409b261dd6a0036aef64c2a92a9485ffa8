      "message": "I was gonna comment that this probably can be done in one line. Given that now both |FromUPtr| and |ToUPtr| are only one liners, what is the value in having these methods instead of just inlining them everywhere? I could see how it might be a bit error prone, as customers need to be aware of Value\u0027s move semantics, is this your concern as well? Lastly, am I correct in assuming that these utility methods are only of temporary nature to help during the migration to the new API and will be removed afterwards?",
