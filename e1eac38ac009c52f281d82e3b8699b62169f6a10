      "message": "Currently the patch doesn\u0027t incorporate existence of element id or the state of the property trees into cc::Animation.affects_{active,pending}_elements and the methods that build atop it.\n\nShould it, and if so, in what manner? Hmm.\n\ncc::Animation active/pending state is based on:\n\n1. defaults affects_active/pending_elements to true in ctor\n2. propagates the pending state when animations are activated\n3. sets newly created impl animations\u0027 active state to false in PushNewAnimationsToImplThread and ScrollAnimationApplyAdjustment\n4. sets affects_pending_elements to false when animations are completed in AnimationTicker::RemoveAnimationsCompletedOnMainThread",

      "message": "I think this patch is fundamentally pursuing an approach where the code is simpler (cease tracking/checking element id presence) at the cost of perhaps ticking animations when their element ids are not present in the layer list/tree.\n\nIf we restore some form of MutatorHostClient::IsElementInList I fear we\u0027ll hit all of the same issues we hit in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/522405\n\nI actually just now tried a hack at restoring it, and early-out-ing in ElementAnimations::Has{Active,Pending}Animations if !mutator_host_client()-\u003eIsElementInList(element_id(), {ACTIVE,PENDING}) but it produces ~60 new unit test failures so I\u0027d rather not go deeper down that path unless we think it\u0027s warranted.\n\nOr, maybe I am missing what you are touching on re: no more animation in active list.",
