It\u0027s generally best for a metric to get emitted just once - otherwise it gets increasingly hard to reason about it. \nIt may be possible this is best, but you may want to verify this is measuring in the clearest way.",

      "message": "I changed the code to call it only once. \n\nThis metric records whether GSU events are latched or not. The first GSU event after a GSB is not latched since GSB causes a hittest to find a new scrolling element. For the rest of the scrolling sequence the GSU events are latched to the current scrolling element. By adding this metric I can compute the percentage of the latched GSU events which is useful for tweaking the latching timer timeout.",
