      "message": "Would it be useful to distinguish between criteria that create a block formatting context per CSS specs and those that create a de facto formatting context for other reasons? Is ruby text one of the latter maybe? Inline tables? Flow threads?\n\nThere is certainly a class of items here that create a formatting context and others that do so less directly - the distinction might help guide future changes here.",

      "message": "Distinguish, so that callers can tell why we need a formatting context? Really hope not. But ordering and commenting the code a bit for the cases that establish formatting context without being backed by some spec - probably a good idea.\n\nNote that we won\u0027t even be here if we\u0027re inline-table (since this code is now in LayoutBlockFlow), so the IsInlineBlockOrInlineTable() may be a bit confusing. I\u0027ll use IsInline() instead.\n\nPlease take a look.",
