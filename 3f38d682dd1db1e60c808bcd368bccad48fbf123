If it\u0027s a new extension, we should hit the code block above, and call AddNewOrUpdatedExtension(), which in turn will call this.  If it\u0027s not a new extension, then it should already be registered in prefs, and RegisterExtension() is called during initialization.  What\u0027s happening to prevent this in the current flow?",
