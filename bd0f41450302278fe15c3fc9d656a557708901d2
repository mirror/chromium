      "message": "This is kinda subtle, but I can consistently hit a DCHECK without this line. In my initial understanding this is caused by CTRL+Z already being a shortcut for undoing a search operation on the password settings page, e.g. if you filter your passwords, hitting CTRL+Z will undo this search and show all passwords. However, we now overload CTRL+Z for our Undo mechanism (which modifies the DOM), causing an inconsistent state and hitting this DCHECK: https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/editing/SelectionTemplate.cpp?l\u003d116\u0026rcl\u003d14288c62ece3db798e3d9f3be756a59e3c2f464e\n\nI was able to consistently reproduce this with and without password store basic. preventDefault fixes the situation, but disables the undo mechanism for filtering. I think undoing a delete is much more important, so this should be fine, but I would definitely appreciate your input here. Maybe there is another option to resolve this?",
