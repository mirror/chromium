I\u0027m thinking again about kInternalInitialisation. Kentaro-san, WDYT?\n\nActually we have tried to add kInternalInitialisation at https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/672028 but not finished since the preventing-tasks-from-being-dropped work is not done yet AFAIK. I prefer kInternalInitialisation to the current kUnthrottled. Done.",
