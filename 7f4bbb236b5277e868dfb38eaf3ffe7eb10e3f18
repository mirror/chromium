      "message": "Seems it\u0027s the only place to call this function (excluding the unittests). It should be able to extract the calculation of |window_selector_bounds_| here or to a member function of ScopedTransformOverviewWindow to avoid adding the new parameter. It does seem like the calculation of |window_selector_bounds_| only relies on |target_bounds| and |title_height|. Or if it\u0027s really necessary to calculate it there, maybe you should turn this function to a non-static member function.",
