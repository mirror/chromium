      "message": "I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m still really not convinced that this is better. It feels kind of like passing a const std::unique_ptr\u003cFoo\u003e\u0026 instead of a const Foo\u0026 or Foo*. The idiomatic thing to seems to be to treat unscoped references as unowned by convention rather than to pass references to their scoping wrappers. In that regard interpreting PlatformHandle as an unowned handle seems completely natural to me.",

      "message": "That\u0027s fair, but we discussed off-line that it would be preferable to merge ScopedPlatformHandle and PlatformHandle, so that PlatformHandle itself is the moveable container, rather than having it sit somewhere between a container and POD.\n\nIf we merge the two then arguably the idiomatic form for these call-sites would be to pass the bare file-descriptor (since they\u0027re POSIX-only and only ever work on FD-based PlatformHandles).\n\nWDYT?",
