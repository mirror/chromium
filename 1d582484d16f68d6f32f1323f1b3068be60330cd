      "message": "These checks are in theory not needed anymore, because after this CL a renderer is not physically able to send an incorrect origin.  OTOH, we still depend on the caller (RenderFrameHostImpl::OpenLocalStorage) to provide the right origin, so maybe we want to retain these checks in some form (as a CHECK maybe?).  FWIW retaining these checks is a bit difficult, because mojo::InterfaceRequest doesnâ€™t today allow checking the process id of the other end of the pipe.",
