      "message": "base::Closure is deprecated in favour of OnceClosure or RepeatingClosure. I think ideally  *both* of these callbacks should cleared out when *either* are run? (e.g. what if a closure has bound a scoped_refptr -- there could be a reference held on when it shouldn\u0027t be). A std::unique_ptr to struct is a neat way to do this and well understood. a std::optional to std::tuple is neither.\n\nSorry - I don\u0027t understand the aversion to struct -- there\u0027s plenty of precedent for this in bluetooth code -- see bluetooth_socket_mac.h (AcceptRequest,SendRequest,ReceiveCallbacks,ConnectCallbacks), bluetooth_socket_net.h (WriteRequest)\n\nPerhaps Android\u0027s remote characteristic can share the same struct. But simple bespoke structs like this tend to be good for code maintainability and encapsulation.",

      "message": "Initially I had the same idea, but unfortunately just capturing `this` doesn\u0027t work. I left a comment to explain why. I am not a big fan of `\u0026adapter \u003d *adapter_` either and I\u0027d rather use `adapter \u003d adapter_.get()`, but the chromium-style plugin currently doesn\u0027t let me. It thinks I am deducing auto to a pointer [1] and breaks compilation. So I think this is the best we can do right now with a lambda.\n\nRegarding your style guide concern: The style guide lists lambdas with captures by references as examples, so I think this should be fine.
