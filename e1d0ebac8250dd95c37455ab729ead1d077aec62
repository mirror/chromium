      "message": "I think OnWallpaperDataChanged (or some alternative mechanism) needs to be kept.\nIt has two responsibilities;\n- Notifies ARC container when setting wallpaper initiated by ARC is completed by android_id_.\n- Notifies ARC container when setting wallpaper initiated by \"some component other than ARC\" is completed. In this case, \u0027-1\u0027 is the expected ID.\n\nIn this PS, the second \u0027-1\u0027 is not sent. Could you keep that behavior?",

We\u0027ll revisit this part when the refactoring is near completion, and we should have more ideas on how to support this in a better way.",
