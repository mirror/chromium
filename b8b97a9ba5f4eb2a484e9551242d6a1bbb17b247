      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I understand all this take/create + cache/delete stuff.  It seems a little awkward to my eyes? It seems like it\u0027d be clearer to just have a CacheEntry to pass around which is either in the cache_ or just on the stack temporarily, and then you could create Optional scalers and converters on that cache entry as needed instead of needing to check for_source in all these helpers and they\u0027d all behave more consistently.\n\nThis is just a drive by function design side-eye.  Feel free to ignore this comment, as I don\u0027t think this patch makes this any different than what\u0027s been there beforehand.",
