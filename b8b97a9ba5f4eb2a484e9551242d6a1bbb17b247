      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I understand all this take/create + cache/delete stuff.  It seems a little awkward to my eyes? It seems like it\u0027d be clearer to just have a CacheEntry to pass around which is either in the cache_ or just on the stack temporarily, and then you could create Optional scalers and converters on that cache entry as needed instead of needing to check for_source in all these helpers and they\u0027d all behave more consistently.\n\nThis is just a drive by function design side-eye.  Feel free to ignore this comment, as I don\u0027t think this patch makes this any different than what\u0027s been there beforehand.",

      "message": "The problem being solved is that some requests will provide a \"source,\" which is a hint that GLRendererCopier should cache things and expect a stream of similarly-configured CopyOutputRequets to follow. When there is no source, we don\u0027t cache anything under the assumption it was a \"one-off\" CopyOutputRequest.\n\nI agree that, with this CL, it\u0027s starting to get a bit clunky. It was much simpler in the previous CLs. I\u0027ve filed crbug.com/781986 to revisit this. For now, I\u0027m way over-due on my work to move tab capture into VIZ; so, I\u0027d like to move forward and get that all done first (to unblock the --mus flag for everyone else on the Mus project).",
