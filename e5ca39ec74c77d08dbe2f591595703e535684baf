      "message": "Just to make sure I understand this.  If we\u0027re hitting TAB to move focus from embedder into a \u003cwebview\u003e, previously as part of target_rfh-\u003eAdvanceFocus(), the webview would\u0027ve sent FrameHostMsg_FrameFocused, which called SetFocusedFrame, which gave focus to the webview.  Now, that won\u0027t work since the source SiteInstance will be the webview SiteInstance and not the embedder\u0027s SiteInstance, so it won\u0027t pass your new check in SetFocusedFrame.  Hence, you focus the webview explicitly here.  Is that right?  Might be good to document some of this in a comment.",
