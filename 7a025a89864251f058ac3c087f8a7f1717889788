First didCommitNavigation: was called for link click navigation (step 2 in bug\u0027s steps to reproduce). It\u0027s correct that didCommitNavigation: was called for the second time. The problem is that WKNavigation* object is not correct, so we just have to find correct navigation item for this navigation.",

      "message": "Sorry I should have asked earlier. For the 2nd didCommitNavigation: callback in the repro case, were you seeing webView.URL \u003d \"SRP\" and WKNavigation* \u003d \"techrepublic.com\"?\n\nWhat if no item is found in sessionController that matches webView.URL? i.e. some other unknown edge case may lead to the same symptom. It probably wouldn\u0027t make sense to call |didStartLoading| then. Should we DCHECK that an item matching webView.URL is found in session history?",
