      "message": "AIUI, if you add a second entry to kCTRequiredPolicies, this typedef won\u0027t cause a compiler error - and the iterative loop in usage means that things will go bad.\n\nMore usefully, however, I also don\u0027t believe you need to add it to a function - because we are initializing in place with a constexpr, the compiler doesn\u0027t do default initialization, and doesn\u0027t introduce a static initializer.\n\nThat is, the fact that you\u0027re now referring to kSymantecRoots/kSymantecRootsLength (versus inline) doesn\u0027t change the POD nature of kCTRequiredPolicies, because the only type (base::TimeDelta) is a trivial-layout, constexpr-initialized object :)",
