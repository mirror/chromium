Maybe I\u0027m missing it but no where do you verify that the \\Device\\HarddiskVolumeX path in the image path you\u0027re replacing matches the one which corresponds to the drive letter. We should probably only check paths which start with the same \\Device\\HarddiskVolumeX path, and then get long path (as if it\u0027s not on the same volume it couldn\u0027t match anyway).",
