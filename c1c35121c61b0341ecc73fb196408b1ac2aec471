      "message": "I\u0027m still not quite following why all the conversions away from passing const references need to happen in this CL. I understand that some of these functions will eventually be called via Mojo, at which point they will need to have the required signature. However, is it yet clear which of these will directly be called by Mojo? My preference would be to leave passing by const ref at this point in as many places as possible and convert to passing by value as needed in followup CLs that introduce the Mojo communication. Does that make sense?",
