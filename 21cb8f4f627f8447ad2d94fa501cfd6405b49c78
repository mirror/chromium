      "message": "That\u0027s correct. It would be possible to push this service to run on a different sequence (it could not be associated in that case, but that\u0027s not a critical part of this), but it\u0027s a simpler mental model if everything happens on the same thread.",

      "message": "I tried a few options, and this was the least ugly that I found.\n\nThe conditions are not *exactly* the same everywhere (in particular, we don\u0027t care whether the map is empty in OnConnectionError()), so it would be more code to unify them. I figured that since the entire implementation fits on one screen it was workable; I\u0027ll unify them if you still think that\u0027s better.",
