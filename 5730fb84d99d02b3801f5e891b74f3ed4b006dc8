This flag would be a cleaner indication as to whether empty policy should be treated as a fatal error. Additionally, the flag would allow [D]CHECK\u0027ing our implicit assumptions on when CloudPolicyStore can be already initialized.\n\nEven more, maybe move the CloudPolicyStore::LoadImmediately() call into this class as well?
