      "message": "I am trying to explain why do we need an out of bounds point as it is not very obvious. This provides more context to whoever read the code. If I move it to commit message, the same person would have to check my commit (which needs a few more steps) to understand the context. I think it would make our code easier to understand. So I would prefer to keep them here. However, I do like your suggestion about adding them to commit message. will copy the string to commit message. Thanks for suggestion!",
