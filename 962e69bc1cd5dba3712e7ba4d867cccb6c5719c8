      "message": "Given that this class is used in other places as well (downloads or history), we should be careful not to put too many assumptions about the UI into this class. I think it\u0027s still fine to say that this class tells a client what a \"card\" UI element or a \"tile\" UI element should look like (in particular if there is an effort to unify UI styles across Clank), but just sth to keep in mind.",

It feels like a bit of a stretch though, are cards and tiles always used in the same way?\n\nThe feature and param checks seem even more of a stretch. We now have NTP and Chrome Home related checks in what used to be a very generic class.",
