      "message": "Given that this class is used in other places as well (downloads or history), we should be careful not to put too many assumptions about the UI into this class. I think it\u0027s still fine to say that this class tells a client what a \"card\" UI element or a \"tile\" UI element should look like (in particular if there is an effort to unify UI styles across Clank), but just sth to keep in mind.",

It feels like a bit of a stretch though, are cards and tiles always used in the same way?\n\nThe feature and param checks seem even more of a stretch. We now have NTP and Chrome Home related checks in what used to be a very generic class.",

Otherwise it would have made sense to have things related to the configuration of the UI be all in one place, and let the NTP or Bottom sheet just read the value. One advantage being that it would be easy to mock these values for tests.\n\nBut yeah out of the suggestions packages this all feel wrong.",
