      "message": "I would have expected that those libraries (gnome/kde) have to run on the UI thread. By capturing the current task runner and using that as the main task runner, you get the same result, however, you now have to search through a bunch of files to see that you really mean the UI thread.",

      "message": "Good point about making it clear that it\u0027s UI thread when it needs to be. As far as I could tell from the existing code, only the Gnome Keyring library really cared about running on the UI thread, though. KDE and Libsecret seem fine with any main thread. So I adjusted just the native_backend_gnome_x.*.",
