It\u0027s a bit convoluted to have this step being executed here, but with a configuration through a virtual method GetDirectoryForTestServer().\n\nIt looks like all existing tests should be fine with starting the test server inside the test itself, but not during SetUp* phases - or am I wrong here?",
