In other words, when would SetView(nullptr) not want to unregister the layer element ids?\n\nCould the PaintArtifactCompostitor destructor DCHECK that there are no layers with element ids left registered?",

      "message": "I think you\u0027re right that we\u0027d be fine unregistering any time PAC is destroyed, but the issue is where the best place to do that is. I didn\u0027t want to add to SetParentVisible(false) or DetachLayout since those are called in many other situations than this one.\n\nI have yet to see the dtor actually get called, probably because it\u0027s garbage collected and I\u0027ve not triggered a GC, and we do need to know that the elements will have been unregistered before we proceed on to animation ticking.\n\nI don\u0027t think it would ever be problematic for SetView(nullptr) to unregister the layer element ids, but it could be unnecessary overhead since I\u0027ve only seen it cause a crash for layout tests with the Blink TestRunner OnReset.\n\nAdded DCHECK to ~PAC, but note that I expect sometimes (potentially frequently?) we may shut down a Chrome process and things get killed and the dtor still won\u0027t be called so the value is somewhat limited, and (b) this code path (when we know we\u0027re replacing a view) is the only one I know of currently where the unregistering of element ids is necessary, and then only maybe for the Blink test runner.",

      "message": "Re: overhead, is SetView() called in a common codepath? I looked around and it doesn\u0027t seem like it would cause overhead on real pages. I think it would be easier to understand this code if we don\u0027t have to special-case the replaced case and just always deregister when the view changes. If view changes without registration changes are common though, LGTM for this patch.",
