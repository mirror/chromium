      "message": "Thank you for bringing this up. It turned out that we decided to not move the switch used by DecodeCapabilities to ui/base due to other dependency issues. That\u0027s also why I didn\u0027t get any error without modifying the BUILD.gn file.\n\nBy deleting the change here and the include in decode_capabilities.cc, there\u0027s no more media changes. Feel free the still take a look at the CL or not.",
