      "message": "These media queries indeed match Max\u0027s specs, but are not quite right for the PDF case. These media queries are tied to the user\u0027s viewport, but I think Max wants them tied to the actual placeholder size. In my case, the PDF can be embedded and smaller than the viewport.\n\nThe solution is probably to use ResizeObserver: https://blog.chromium.org/2017/12/chrome-64-beta-stronger-pop-up-blocker_14.html\n\nI wanted to get some feedback from you on this before I went off and implemented this though. Do you want to use ResizeObserver for the interstitial_webview_quiet as well?",

      "message": "Aaah, I see how this differs from the WebView interstitials. In those cases the viewport is the iframe embed size or the whole screen. I had thought that\u0027s how embeds are treated, but obviously not. \n\nAs this case doesn\u0027t happen on the quiet interstitials I would implement for the embed use case only.",
