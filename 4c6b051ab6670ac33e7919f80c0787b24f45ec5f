      "message": "These media queries indeed match Max\u0027s specs, but are not quite right for the PDF case. These media queries are tied to the user\u0027s viewport, but I think Max wants them tied to the actual placeholder size. In my case, the PDF can be embedded and smaller than the viewport.\n\nThe solution is probably to use ResizeObserver: https://blog.chromium.org/2017/12/chrome-64-beta-stronger-pop-up-blocker_14.html\n\nI wanted to get some feedback from you on this before I went off and implemented this though. Do you want to use ResizeObserver for the interstitial_webview_quiet as well?",
