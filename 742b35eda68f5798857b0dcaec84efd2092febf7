SPARSE_SLOWLY still seems like the wrong thing to me here since we\u0027re logging values in an enum. mpearson: If this is correct (and not just \"it\u0027ll work\"), would you please update the guidance in https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/de5e4bf1c32c92265c69735a240d46ee198e3a72/tools/metrics/histograms/README.md#Enum-Histograms and https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/de5e4bf1c32c92265c69735a240d46ee198e3a72/tools/metrics/histograms/README.md#When-To-Use-Sparse-Histograms to make it more clear when to use one over the other? For example, maybe sparse is better when only a single value will be logged for the lifetime of the process. Thanks.",
