You could move it to chromium.org.\n\nHowever, I think a commit message should be a permanent record so it probably shouldn\u0027t link to a sheet that\u0027s going to change (you might not want to keep that column there forever; we probably don\u0027t want a column for every patch). Can you just summarize the information here instead?",
