      "message": "Can this be done in a more principled way, rather than clamping size to 1? Could you instead check right after the glGetActiveUniform call whether size is 0, and just either continue, or abort the loop?\n\nI\u0027m surprised if the context is really being lost via KHR_robustness and that\u0027s really why size is invalid. Shouldn\u0027t the name of the uniform also be bogus (or not filled in at all) in that case, too?",

      "message": "Looked into this a bit, and afaict, everything in chrome code is working as expected. The context got lost, everything in the context group gets destroyed, and recreated, and shaders has to be compiled again, and driver misbehaves then and crashes.\n\nI double checked that a real new eglContext is created, and not just a virtual context reusing the same lost eglContext. Although I\u0027m not sure if this is actually guarantees or just a coincidence..\n\nSimply skipping the loop doesn\u0027t help because it just crashes in HandleUseProgram later. So I don\u0027t know. If 0 really is an illegal value, maybe it\u0027s easier to crash with a release CHECK instead, and check how many things hit the check.",

      "message": "This hack is not a good workaround. The context\u0027s state is broken and all bets are off regarding correctness after this point. The program\u0027s state should be marked invalid.\n\nCan you please try changing UpdateUniforms() to return a bool, returning false in this case, and then changing Program::Update to return early in that case? The problem is probably that Program::valid_ is getting set to true. If it were still false then the next call to DoUseProgram would generate an INVALID_OPERATION, not crash.",
