      "message": "This DCHECK prevented me from creating the object on the webrtc signaling thread as opposed to the main thread (because of a main thread DCHECK in track_adapter_-\u003ewebrtc_track(), remember that TODO?) and also prevents you from creating an RTCRtpReceiver before the adapter is initialized.\n\nNow I want to create it before it is initialized (I don\u0027t have to but it makes the code simpler and still guaranteed to be safe) and the DCHECK about webrtc_track() and track() matching is performed in the getters of this class already.",
