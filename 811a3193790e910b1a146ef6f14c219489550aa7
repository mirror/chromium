      "message": "This implies that there\u0027s a 1-1 correlation between Bind/Connect and datagrams being sent/received, which is very much not true--some consumers will use both, and some consumers will just use one but both send and receive datagrams.  How about \"Use one or both of Bind() or Connect() to specify socket address/default destination address\"?  Or if you don\u0027t want that much information here, just \"Use one or both of Bind() or Connect()\"?",

I was surprised by that (and am still not clear it\u0027s how Posix sockets behave, though reading the man pages I could see arguing it both ways), so it might be worthwhile documenting.",
