      "message": "A thought for a future patch: at the moment we do not start tracing when renderer scheduler is created. Explicitly mentioning all tracers in the constructor doesn\u0027t feel right.\n\nShall we integrate tracing concepts as first-class citizens: let\u0027s introduce TracedValue class and replace normal fields with it?\n\nSo it would look like TracedValue\u003cUseCase, kTracingCategoryNameDefault\u003e use_case (we can provide tracing name and a function to convert these values to strings in the constructor) and every time we set a use case assignment operator for this class would automatically sort out tracing.\n\nWDYT?",
