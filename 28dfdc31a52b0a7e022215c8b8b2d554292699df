      "message": "Hmm... interesting.  I\u0027m not *super* worried about this being visible to other extensions, though it does raise a couple interesting questions.  For instance, we protect requests made by extensions from other extensions, but we currently only apply that to requests from a dedicated extension process (and even then, I think it\u0027s mostly just a best-effort).  If we can deterministically tell whether an extension content script made a request, it might be worth protecting those requests from other extensions - though it\u0027s hard to say if that would break anything we consider important.  There\u0027s also the possibility that an extension would target another extension, blocking all its requests, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a much greater risk (the content script requests weren\u0027t protected before, so any determined bad extension could just look for a request pattern or similar).\n\nOne thing I would like to check, though, is whether the change in ResourceFetcher.cpp would visible to the server in any way?  We deliberately hide the fact that a request is coming from an extension when it goes to the server.",
