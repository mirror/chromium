      "message": "Having non-copying copy constructor sounds like inviting troubles to me...\nA RAII class should be non-copyable, and this kind of almost-copy could use a named constructor, i.e.:\nclass PaintInfo {\n  static PaintInfo NewScope(const PaintInfo\u0026 other);\n\nOr just simply separate the RAII part and the POD part like this:\nclass BoxPainter {\n  class AdjustPaintOffsetScope {\n  public:\n    AdjustPaintOffsetScope(const LayoutBox\u0026, const PaintInfo\u0026);\n    operator const PaintInfo\u0026() const { return local_paint_info; }\n  private:\n    PaintInfo local_paint_info;\n  };\n};\n\nBy the way, paint offset used to be not a part of PaintInfo because paint offset mutate much more often than other fields in PaintInfo. Since now we always make a copy of PaintInfo when paint offset changes, how about just make it part of PaintInfo?",
