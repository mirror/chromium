      "message": "my aura expertise isn\u0027t to the level of sky and sadrul yet. I\u0027m not 100% sure if you\u0027re guaranteed a transient parent, or if that\u0027s the right parent to use. You might simply be after aura::Window::parent(), rather than the transient parent.\n\nOr perhaps either will work, but the direct aura::Window::parent() will make for simpler code.\n\nMaybe try that out? (or describe why transient works but parent() does not). But I\u0027ll defer to sky or sadrul - feel free to loop one of them in now if you\u0027ve already investigated.",

      "message": "OK, I checked with sky@ and this is fine. The issue is that\nwith Aero Glass disabled, something like a bubble will be a\nNativeWidgetAura and not a DesktopNativeWidgetAura, so the\nonly way to get the parent window in that case is with\nTransientWindowManager.\n\nSo in this code we just check TransientWindowManager to see\nif it has a parent. If not, we call back on aura::Window::parent.\n\nThe main issue here is that for accessibility we need\nto be able to walk up to the window that has the HWND.",
