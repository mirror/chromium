You might simply be after aura::Window::parent(), rather than the transient parent.\n\nOr perhaps either will work, but the direct aura::Window::parent() will make for simpler code.\n\nMaybe try that out? (or describe why transient works but parent() does not). But I\u0027ll defer to sky or sadrul - feel free to loop one of them in now if you\u0027ve already investigated.",
