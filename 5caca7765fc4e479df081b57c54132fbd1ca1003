      "message": "Wait, how is the ownership model going to work here? If PublicIpAddressGeolocationProvider has a StrongBindingSet, then this class shouldn\u0027t have any knowledge of the bindings. My suspicion is that you\u0027re doing it this way because of the need for line 30. Note that StrongBindingSet has a ReportBadMessage() method that can be called during message dispatch to close the binding that the message being dispatched was received from. My suggestion would be to expose that from PublicIpAddressGeolocationProvider via a callback that this class takes in. Then PublicIpAddressGeolocationProvider has a StrongBindingSet and this class has no knowledge of the bindings whatsoever. Does that make sense?",
