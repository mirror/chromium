      "message": "Could we pass in the GpuChannelManagerDelegate directly, rather than the GpuChannelManager, since that\u0027s all you need?\nIt would be fairly odd to talk to the GpuChannelManager from here. Doubly so in the Android WebView case where it lives on a different thread.\n\nIt does make sense to call the GpuChannelManagerDelegate (though we may want to rename it) from here, in particular we may consider doing other things such as StoreShaderToDisk",

There is a blocking calls involved in setting that up, which means that SetChild() has been called before DoSetParentOnChild().\n\nIn viz, there is only one ContextProvider/CommandBuffer for all Compositors. The Display is created separate and isn\u0027t involved in this. There is no blocking call for subsequent Compositors and DoSetParentOnChild() can happen before SetChild().",

      "message": "FYI calling SetParent on the I/O thread like this (particularly inside a lock) is a bit risky. It could cause a synchronous windows message to the parent window (on the UI thread), which could deadlock. In practice it\u0027s probably ok because WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY was specified on the child window.",
