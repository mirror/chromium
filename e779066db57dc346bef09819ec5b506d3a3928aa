It certainly wasn\u0027t what I thought it was (i.e., the URL of the most recent frame to commit in the process).\n\nIt looks like it gets updated to be the frame which is processing any IPC message, or being told to navigate, or that fails a navigation.  I\u0027m a bit surprised it isn\u0027t updated on commit.  Is that always covered by the IPC message handler case?  Aren\u0027t we losing that in Mojo?",
