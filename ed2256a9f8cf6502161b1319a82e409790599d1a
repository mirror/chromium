I\u0027d rather update the signature of `WillProcessResponse` to allow it to process a response in isolation rather than carrying state in the throttle by hooking every request and redirect.\n\nI think we want to pass this data in somehow, but I\u0027m totally open to doing this differently: we could alter `ThrottlingURLLoader::OnReceiveResponse` to accept a URL, for instance? Or pass through the `ResourceRequest` that it\u0027s holding onto?",
