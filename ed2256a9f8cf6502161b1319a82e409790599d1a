I\u0027d rather update the signature of `WillProcessResponse` to allow it to process a response in isolation rather than carrying state in the throttle by hooking every request and redirect.\n\nI think we want to pass this data in somehow, but I\u0027m totally open to doing this differently: we could alter `ThrottlingURLLoader::OnReceiveResponse` to accept a URL, for instance? Or pass through the `ResourceRequest` that it\u0027s holding onto?",

It looks saving origin_ there in the throttle is probably a bit wrong, because at that point we don\u0027t really know we follow the redirect or not... so the current throttle interface is not enough anyways.\n\nFor our purpose probably I imagine the easiest could be to stash the necessary info within ThrottlingURLLoader and extend (once again) URLLoaderThrottle::WillProcessResponse() to take additional URL.  We could save the redirected URL in OnReceiveRedirect and commit it in OnFollowRedirect to make sure that we pass the URL in URLLoaderThrottle::WillProcessResponse.\n\nAlternatively we can continue pursuing the current approach, while in that case we also probably need to code same/similar thing in some of each URLLoader implementation.",
