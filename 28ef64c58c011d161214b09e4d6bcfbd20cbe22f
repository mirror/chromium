      "message": "The main purpose of this class is to forward broadcasted ObjectiveC UI info to FullscreenModel, which is in C++.  The final implementation of FullscreenBroadcastReceiver will have a FullscreenModel pointer and will pass all received broadcast information to the model.\n\nEssentially, this is the inverse of the observer bridge pattern we use elsewhere.  I haven\u0027t seen any Objective-C \u003d\u003e C++ bridges yet though; do you want me to just create a generalized bridge for all broadcast functions?",
