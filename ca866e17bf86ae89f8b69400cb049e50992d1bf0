      "message": "I\u0027d agree - having UMA of a single extension\u0027s total block time doesn\u0027t really help us from a metrics standpoint, because it doesn\u0027t have any context (did it run on 100 pages, 1000?).  I think having UMA from individual block times will serve the purpose we want more accurately.\n\nWDYT, Karan?",
