So when the feature is enabled, page_scale_factor includes *both* device scale and page scale. value of device_scale_factor is not affected.\n\nSo let\u0027s say device scale \u003d 3, (the old concept of) page scale \u003d 2. Then when feature is not enabled:\ndevice_scale_factor \u003d 3, page_scale_factor \u003d 2,\nwhen feature is enabled:\ndevice_scale_factor \u003d 3, page_scale_factor \u003d 6\n\nSo this division converting back to (the old concept of) DIP.\n\n\nIt is kind of fuzzy which part of code has \"page scale factor\" converted to new behavior, which which part does not. I think roughly everything including and after blink is converted, so things like frame metadata has the new behavior. But browser sending things down to renderer have not been converted afaik (which is unforunate..)",
