      "message": "I was trying to think of a compelling way to express this same idea earlier today. Similar to your \"it should be feasible for a third party to build a new API-compliant implementation of the service\" at the top, I\u0027d like to convey something along the lines of:\n\nRemember that these are intended to be foundational services which make sense even in a Chrome-less system environment. Do your APIs make sense if Chrome does not exist?\n\nBut I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s actually the right way to say it.",

      "message": "nit: Not to get too bikesheddy here but I don\u0027t like the use of \"factory\" for interfaces like this. You aren\u0027t really manufacturing a new Thing, you\u0027re vending or binding new handles to a Thing.\n\nOK so it\u0027s kind of bikesheddy.\n\nMy recommendation has usually been \"FooProvider\" but only because it\u0027s consistent with InterfaceProvider. If I had to do it all over again I would probably use \"binder\" as the noun everywhere. InterfaceBinder, FooBinder, etc.",

Perhaps we ought to think more about this idea, with reasonably low priority.",
