Similar to your \"it should be feasible for a third party to build a new API-compliant implementation of the service\" at the top, I\u0027d like to convey something along the lines of:\n\nRemember that these are intended to be foundational services which make sense even in a Chrome-less system environment. Do your APIs make sense if Chrome does not exist?\n\nBut I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s actually the right way to say it.",
