That might be why the popup is not visible on Mac, and allow you to remove the separate |is_visible_| member.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find out why the popup is saying it\u0027s not visible on Mac.\n\nI suspect it\u0027s also not *actually* visible on Aura, but popup_-\u003eIsVisible() is lying everywhere *except* Mac. Running with --enable-pixel-output-in-tests and placing some base::RunLoop().Run() calls to pause the test run at the right place should allow you to verify.",
