      "message": "I think it would be good to add some comments about when the API clients are supposed to call this function. For example, should they call this every time they want to start using the API?  Or should they truly just call this when they have reason to believe that the component is not installed on the system or the currently installed component is out of date?\n\nAn alternative design is to call this something like `initializeEngine`, and any explicit calls to the Component Updater are handled under the hood.  That would facilitate a single component containing several possible graph specifications.  At this point we can probably assume a 1-1 relationship between components and graphs, so it could be over-engineering right now.  Or we could have `initializeEngine` as well as `loadComponent` and the API client would have to call `loadComponent` if `initializeEngine` returns a NOT_AVAILABLE state or something.",

      "message": "Thanks for the comment Adam! I added a clarifying comment that the intention of this function is that it should be called every time a client starts using the API, with the expectation that you\u0027ll get errors on the other API calls until this has been done.\n\nI think we could discuss the broader, more general design offline, which would be implemented as part of MPP V2. My intention with this CL is to augment the existing API to be able to use either CU OR the existing mri_package binary. Depending on timeline, your team could continue to piggyback off of this API (like your POC) until the drastically revamped V2 is completed.",
