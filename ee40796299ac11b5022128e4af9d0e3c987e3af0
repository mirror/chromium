      "message": "Suppose the Video frame already has a release_sync_token_, and then VideoResourceUpdater::ReturnTexture is called with a new release sync token from the browser compositor. This will wait for the existing release_sync_token_ on the compositor context, then copy the browser\u0027s sync token into the VideoFrame\u0027s release_sync_token_.\n\nSo when the video frame does WaitForSyncTokenCHROMIUM on the media context, it will only wait for the new release_sync_token_, not the previous one. So it\u0027s possible that the frame could be modified on the media context before the previous release_sync_token_ has finished.",
