      "message": "How about instead of |accept_new_tasks_| we have an AtomicInt32.\n\nThe contract is that you must increment it at the top of this method. It being negative after the AtomicIncrement is equivalent to |accept_new_tasks_ \u003d\u003d false|. And you AtomicDecrement when done (in a ScopedClosure to which we pass a pre-bound RepeatingClosure (to avoid a Bind() call every PostTask()).\n\nIn the destructor you loop CAS 0 to std::numerics_limits\u003cAtomic32\u003e::min() before destroying |message_loop_|.\n\nThat seems simple and makes this CL a proper no-op? (can even get rid of |message_loop_lock_| I think?)",
