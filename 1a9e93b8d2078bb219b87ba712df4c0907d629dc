      "message": "Are you sure about this value range? Do you really expect the VR assets component to take an hour to be ready? And is sub 500ms not possible? A histogram allocates an array of size \u003d num buckets, so if you don\u0027t expect or care about latencies above 1 minute, you\u0027re basically wasting half that array and costing yourself granularity. You can look at https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/tools/metrics/histograms/README.md#count-histograms for more detail (talks about counts histograms, but it also aplies to times)",
