I made that change at day 2 of this review at Sam\u0027s suggestion.  You nitted about nullptr a few days back.  Now this nit.\n\nIf you have more, could you please mention all of them all once, so I can deal with them all at once?  Sending some one day, then some more a day or two later, is not helpful.\n\n\u003e Nit 2: I /think/ this would usually be prefixed with \"Get\": it seems much more common in Chrome at least.\n\n\u003e (Blink has stlightly different naming conventions, for better or worse)\n\nUsed Get..., yeah Blink has a slightly different convention, I don\u0027t tend use it there per style.",
