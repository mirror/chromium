      "message": "I\u0027m not really an owner here but it seems OK for the ctor to take an |int| since |error_code| is an int?\n\nAlso did you consider adding another ctor for ResourceRequestCompletionStatus(int error_code, int64_t length) too? I guess it\u0027s weird because Error is always OK? But still seems to help readability over setting the len in two statements after the ctor.",
