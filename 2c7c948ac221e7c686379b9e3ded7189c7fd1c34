I\u0027ll make |error_code| to an int if there is no objection.\n\n\u003e Also did you consider adding another ctor for ResourceRequestCompletionStatus(int error_code, int64_t length) too?

As my previous comment, |length| would be an optional param and it looks odd that the struct treats only |length| as special.",
