      "message": "Artifacts are not possible anymore as this patch makes use defer buffer updates if there\u0027s a chance they could cause artifacts. The higher this value is the less likely it is that we have to defer a buffer update. 100 is seems enough to make it very unlikely that we\u0027ll have to defer an update. Note: that an alternative is to have surface damage always cover the whole screen and never defer buffer updates. However, that\u0027s not ideal from a performance perspective.",
