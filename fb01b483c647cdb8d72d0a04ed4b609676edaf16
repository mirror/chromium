      "message": "Mostly yes.\nThis old test assumed:\n1) 0 duration buffer at the end of a range would instead have dynamic (and only growing) duration based on (1/2 of) fudge room; and that initial duration would be no less than 1ms (minimum fudge room): https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/media/filters/source_buffer_stream.cc?q\u003dsource_buffer_stream.cc\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr\u0026l\u003d28\n2) \"Inconsistent\" meaning the fudge room could not *decrease* (causing previous determination that two ranges are adjacent to change to *not* adjacent.) Previous wording here was incomplete. With this change, the fudge room still should not decrease *.\n\n* Verification of this would need a new test that doesn\u0027t depend on the (now removed) logic that subbed the dynamic (1/2 of) fudge room for 0-duration buffers\u0027 duration. I\u0027ll look into adding a replacement test in later patch set of this CL.",
