A. This directory contains the source code of ICU 3.8 for C/C++ with CJK
  segmentation, plural formatting and other locale-data updates added:

  - It was obtained with the following:

    1. Download the clean ICU source tree (revision 22777) with the following :

       $ svn export --native-eol LF -r 22777 http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk icu38

    2. Apply the following 8 patches :
        
       * segmentation.patch.txt  (CJ segmentation patch : code change + data)
       * data.patch.txt (ICU data customization patch)
       * data.patch2.txt, data.patch3.txt
         (Additional ICU data customization patches: to be applied on top of
          data.patch.txt)
       * eucjp.patch.txt (to be applied on top of 3 data patches above).
       * indian8_locales.txt (to be applied on top of above data paches) :
         Add locale data for 8 Indian languages
       * gbk.patch.txt (to be applied after the above patches) : Make
         GBK converter in ICU used outside Webkit behave identically
	 to GBK converter used in Webkit (see
	 WebCore/platform/text/TextCodecICU.cpp : getGbkEscapes())
       * windows.patch (Windows-specific patch)
       * uconv.patch (thread-safety patch for uconv. Ported from the ICU trunk)
       * wpo.patch (see section E).
       * plural.patch (for plural formatting. Ported back from ICU 4.0. See
         section G for details).
       * uconv.security.patch (patches for ICU bug 5691/Chrome bug 2074.
         The patch for HZ encoding is not included because we don't
         support HZ).

  - Once CJK segmentation is included in an ICU release, we can use that
    release, instead of applying the first patch above.

  - The first patch contains the word frequency list derived from 3
    sources. For details, see the license terms and copyright notice
    at the beginning of the following two files: 
      source/data/brkitr/cjdict.txt 
      source/data/brkitr/cc_cedict.txt 
     

B. We build ICU 3.8 with VC++ 8 statically linked to VC8 runtime library
  via the project files in the build directory.  The files under
  source\common\unicode and source\i18n\unicode were moved under public
  so that consumer don't accidently include internal header files.

C. The data tables DLL (icudt38.dll) is converted from the archive file 
  (trunk/third_party/icu38/source/data/in/icudt38l.dat) built on Linux.
  Consumers normally just copy the converted file (icudt38.dll) by including
  the build/icudt.vcproj file.  Additionally, icudt38l_dat.s is included as
  prebuilt ICU data for the Mac and Linux builds in the mac and linux
  subdirectories.

D. The following procedure was taken to build a customized icudt38l.dat on Linux. 

   1. Download the ICU 3.8 source as explained in A.1 above.

     $ svn export --native-eol LF -r 22777 http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk icu38

   2. Apply the first two patches listed in A.2 above. 
   'data.patch.txt' contains the following data customization:
      
      - Customized encoding coverter tables and aliases
      - Locale data customizations
      - removal of source/data/ucmebcdic.mk
      - fil (Filipino locale) copied from google's copy of ICU
      - A few changes in makefiles to reduce the data size 
        (e.g. excluding invicu.dat).

     Below are the list of changes ported back from ICU 4.0. When
     we upgrade to ICU 4.0, we don't have to modify files listed below.

      - es_XX locale fixes for some Latin-American locales (locales/es*.txt)
      - ja (Japanese) and id (Indonesian) date formatting fixes
        (locales/ja.txt locales/id.txt)
      - character iterator for extended grapheme cluster support
        (brkitr/char.txt)
      - line iterators : Fixes an issue with Ideographic punctuation marks. 
        (brkitr/line.txt)

   3. Configure the source in $ICUROOT/source

      $ runConfigureICU Linux

   4. Run 'make' and icudt38l.dat will be generated in source/data/out/tmp

   5. Check in icudt38l.dat as 
     trunk/third_party/icu38/source/data/in/icudt38l.dat

   6. If you build 'icudt-build' solution on Windows, you will get

      trunk/third_party/icu38/build/{Debug,Release}/icudt38.dll

   7. icudt38.dll need to be checked in as 

      trunk/third_party/icu38/icudt38.dll

   8. As mentioned above, consumers just use icudt38.dll by including build/icudt.vcproj file.
  
E. In addition to files included in patches listed in A2, the following files
   are modified in our copy of ICU 3.8 to build on Windows:

     source\stubdata\stubdatabuilt.txt  (just an empty file added)
     source\common\udata.c              (fix WPO issue, see wpo.patch)
     source\common\ucmndata.h           (fix WPO issue, see wpo.patch)
     source\stubdata\stubdata.c         (fix WPO issue, see wpo.patch)

F. Mac and Linux platform headers (common/p{mac,linux}.h):

   Mac:
   - A platform.h equivalent for Mac was generated by running configure on
     a Mac;
   - The generated file was renamed from platform.h to pmac.h to avoid
     colliding with other autoconf-based platforms that also natively use
     platform.h.  The name pmac.h was selected to follow the scheme used by
     other prebuilt platform files in the ICU distribution, such as pwin32.h;
   - The file was moved from source/common/unicode to public/common/unicode
     (see B above);
   - The U_WCHAR_IS_UTF32 macro was added to pmac.h, because we're only
     concerned with wchar_t strings containing UTF-32 data on the Mac;
   - public/common/unicode/umachine.h was updated to include pmac.h instead of
     platform.h on the Mac;
   - icu.gyp was added to enable gyp-based builds to use ICU.

   Linux:
   - Similarly to the Mac case.  Let ICUROOT be third_party/icu38.  Then:

     cd $ICUROOT/source
     ln -s ../public/common/unicode ./common/
     ./runConfigureICU Linux
     mv -f ./common/unicode/platform.h ./common/unicode/plinux.h
     rm ./common/unicode

     This produces the plinux.h header file.

G. Plural formatter was ported back from ICU 4.0 to ICU 3.8 by 
   applying the patch (plural.patch). The files affected are :

       source/common/utypes.c	
       source/i18n/Makefile.in
       source/i18n/i18n.vcproj
       source/i18n/msgfmt.cpp	
       source/i18n/msgfmt_impl.h	
       source/i18n/plurfmt.cpp	
       source/i18n/plurrule.cpp
       source/i18n/plurrule_impl.h
       source/test/intltest/Makefile.in
       source/test/intltest/intltest.vcproj
       source/test/intltest/itformat.cpp	
       source/test/intltest/plurfmts.cpp
       source/test/intltest/plurfmts.h	
       source/test/intltest/plurults.cpp
       source/test/intltest/plurults.h
       source/test/intltest/tmsgfmt.cpp	
       source/test/intltest/tmsgfmt.h	
       public/common/unicode/utypes.h
       public/i18n/unicode/msgfmt.h
       public/i18n/unicode/plurfmt.h
       public/i18n/unicode/plurrule.h

  Besides, builds/icu.vcproj was modified to add plurrule.cpp and
  plurfmt.cpp to the list of files to compile. Note that this change
  is not a part of plural.patch because builds/icu.vcproj is 
  our own file.
