The winsup-src-20070126.tar.bz2 archive is a snapshot of the code from 
http://cygwin.org/. 

If you need to update the source to modify or add to the build tools in 
trunk/src/third_pary/cygwin, please replace the archive with an image of the 
sources you use.

See CYGWIN_LICENSE and the README in trunk/src/third_party/cygwin for the terms
under which the source code may be used.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
convert.py modified the cygwin1.dll so that it can be used in the build system
without disrupting an existing cygwin installation.

Create cygwin1.dll, copy it to cygwin1.dll.original, and run

  convert.py cygwin1.dll.original
  
Replace trunk/src/third_party/cygwin/bin/cygwin1.dll with the resulting dll.
