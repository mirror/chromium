This directory is our copy of webkit, which we are currently transitioning to
a vendor branch and getting ready for the continuous merge.

Here are the rules for making changes:


* If you need to tweak WebKit code and the file is in /trunk/src/webkit/port,
  make changes there

* If you are fixing a bug that involves a file that's still in pending:

  * Unobsolete the file in third_party/WebKit (svn mv [file].obs [file]),

  * Copy the file from pending over the newly unobsoleted file

  * Remove the file from pending (svn rm [file])

* Make your bug-fixing changes, ensuring that the changes are
  "branch-friendly", ifdef'ing the changes if they are Chromium-specific,
  using appropriate functionality-specific defines

* Submit the change upstream to bugs.webkit.org and include the link to webkit
  bug in your review

* Add dglazkov@chromium.org to the list of reviewers

* After the changes are committed, roll the WebKit revision in src/DEPS to let
  others pick up your changes

If you have any questions or comments about the process, please direct them to
dglazkov@chromium.org.
