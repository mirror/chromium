      "message": "Do you intend to initially ship with audioLevel possibly being null, or should this be fixed before shipping? If the latter, then can this CL wait until the TODO is fixed? I realize that\u0027s an annoying thing to ask for, but small differences in our IDL compared to the specs creep in and are forgotten all the time.\n\nAlternatively, how about just changing the spec to let this be null when it\u0027s not in the header extension? Is it actually important that it\u0027s computed when it\u0027s not in the header?",

      "message": "I do intend to ship with audioLevel possibly being null. Computing the audio level when it is null here would be a non-trivial change to WebRTC. I think that providing the audio level from the header extension when possible is useful on its own. The limitation of this implementation is described on chromestatus (https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5637113429098496).\n\nIt looks like there is an open issue in the spec about making the field nullable (https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/1665). I am following up with the spec owners.",
