      "message": "Is it possible to restructure this so we only need one cleanup task? It means that we\u0027d need to only set observer_added_ on the db tracker task runner, but I think that shouldn\u0027t be too hard to do: the DatabaseHostMsg_Opened message is handled on the db tracker task runner anyway, so instead of calling AddObserver in OverrideTaskRunnerForMessage, we can just call AddObserver (if needed) in OnDatabaseOpened, right?",

My assumption is as I can specify a task runner for the interface we won\u0027t need to switch threads like this to execute the cleanup tasks?",

It was simpler to do this then setup another registry.\n\nNote I was using EmbeddedWorkerInstanceClientImpl as prior art for doing it this way, but it was recently removed in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/618077.\n\nIf you feel strongly enough I can try and setup another registry instead - WDYT?",
