The HighlighterController interface is trying very hard not to have an \"enabled\" state, and so far it worked.\nHave you considered calling highlighter_client_-\u003eDetach instead? Unless I am missing something this should do exactly what you want (it is already being done from OnInstanceClosed at line 238). The only other thing you will have to take care of is re-attaching when necessary.",
