      "message": "Other parts of this file stat_cast the parameters to the expected type (for instance, l.19647, but many other places as well).... seems unnecessary, as they are defined as the correct types in the struct - is this just a remnant of a previous implementation where these were defined more generically? Or is there a reason for this cast?",
