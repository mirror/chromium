      "message": "Are the touchactions in this map disjoint sets of bits, or do some of them overlap? IOW would this ever be non-0 if it found two matching touchactions? These would be good examples in unit tests for this function.\n\nI appreciate there\u0027s tests of the LTHI api, but it would be nice to cover corner cases of this method more directly, then verify LTHI behaviours from the LTHI tests, rather than testing every corner case of this class through it. Then if we use this class elsewhere, or move it off LTHI, we don\u0027t lose test coverage of this class by accident along the way, and refactoring or changing this class can be covered by tests close by that are easy to find.\n\nIf we add tests for this class directly, then I\u0027m not sure if it makes sense to have as many test cases on LTHI as you have or not, if they are testing behaviour in the LTHI class then they do but maybe some could go, you could have a look and see what you think.",
