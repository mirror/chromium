How do the binaries, tests, etc find one another correctly, otherwise?\n\ne.g. if I run base_unittests and that depends on awesome_helper_exe then we put base_unittests at the top-level of /system/ while awesome_helper_exe ends up at /system/ or /system/out/ etc depending on what other files are included in locations_to_add - how does base_unittests then no where to find it?",
