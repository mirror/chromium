      "message": "Further note -- here we are essentially keeping a cache of the active/pending state. I believe it can change particularly since for example ui LayerAnimator has long-lived AnimationPlayers where animations come and go. But, InitAffectedElementTypes is only called by AnimationHost::RegisterPlayerForElement, so I think we may need to also update these bools whenever we update the animation\u0027s active/pending state.\n\nCurrently that happens in three places:\n\n1. AnimationPlayer::ActivateAnimations\n  - called by LayerTreeHostImpl::UpdateSyncTreeAfterCommitOrImplSideInvalidation\n    and ActivateSyncTree\n\n2. AnimationPlayer::PushNewAnimationsToImplThread\n3. ScrollOffsetAnimationsImpl::ScrollAnimationApplyAdjustment\n  - both (2) and (3) eventually called via LayerTreeHost::FinishCommitOnImplThread\n    animation push data flow",
