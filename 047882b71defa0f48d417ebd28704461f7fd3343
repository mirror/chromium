      "message": "Currently it gets dropped, but there is no negative impact because this happens for the system dialog case only, and the callback that is passed in that case is a no-op (see printer_capabilities.cc).\n\nHowever, probably better to always run the callback, in case something changes, and I believe OnceCallbacks in general expect to be called exactly once.",

      "message": "Yes - it triggers PrintPreviewDone() and the removal of the dialog from the dialog controller via the \"normal\" print preview web contents destruction path, which is how this works when the dialog isn\u0027t hidden and contained in the background printing manager. Actually, I am now wondering if, with this change, background printing manager still needs to listen for Print job released. I do not think it does, so may upload a follow-up CL to get rid of that reference to the notification since we ultimately want to remove it.",
