      "message": "I really like this idea.\n\nSolving for the 0th and 1st derivatives to equal should probably be done using Newton\u0027s method.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to fit this in with the Gauss-Newton iteration -- there\u0027s a good chance that they would fight. Maybe we should do the first few Gauss-Newton steps with fD fixed (say, at 0.15 or 0.25), and then allow the two to duke it out in the last steps.\n\nAnother idea that I had was to do something like golden section search for fD.",

      "message": "If you want to newton it, this is the equation:\n\n(AD+B) ^ G + E Â \u003d DGA(AD+B)^(G-1)   (solve for D)\n\nArithmetic solutions are not possible I think.\nThe newton method will converge faster but should yield the same result.\n\nI agree that fighting is likely, and it could become degenerate where D grows out of control.\nHowever, it\u0027s possible that none of this is an issue and that it will settle just fine in 99% of all cases, which we would have to test...\n\nGolden section search?",
