      "message": "I really like this idea.\n\nSolving for the 0th and 1st derivatives to equal should probably be done using Newton\u0027s method.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to fit this in with the Gauss-Newton iteration -- there\u0027s a good chance that they would fight. Maybe we should do the first few Gauss-Newton steps with fD fixed (say, at 0.15 or 0.25), and then allow the two to duke it out in the last steps.\n\nAnother idea that I had was to do something like golden section search for fD.",
