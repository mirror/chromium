      "message": "Hi mek, dmurph: How would you recommend converting from a vector of storage::DataElement to storage::mojom::DataElementPtr while inside //content/child? As seen here, I have a ResourceRequestBody and I want to create a Mojo Blob from it to pass to a service worker.\n\nI started writing something like:\n\n   for (const auto\u0026 elem : *resource_request.request_body-\u003eelements()) {\n      switch(elem.type()) {\n        case ResourceRequestBody::Element::TYPE_BYTES:\n          mojom::DataElement::NewBytes(mojom::DataElementBytes::New(...)\n      }\n\nBut this looks a bit cumbersome.. I need to make a BytesProvider and the existing impl blink::BlobBytesProvider isn\u0027t a public Blink API.  Is there an easier way?",

      "message": "Hmm, good question. Ideally ultimately no code outside of the blob system itself would deal with storage::DataElements. If you could somehow move this code into blink you could just be using blink::BlobData/blink::BlobDataHandle directly?\n\nIf for whatever reason this always will have to remain outside of blink, I guess we\u0027ll have to somehow extract blink::BlobData  and the blink::BlobDataHandle constructor code into WebKit/common. Not quite sure yet how tricky that would be (or rather than doing trying to refactor the blink-side code today, we could add new mojo-blob only code to WebKit/common and later migrate blink::BlobDataHandle to use that code when it no longer needs to support ipc-blobs).\n\nI don\u0027t really know how this code is used well enough to figure out what the best solution is. But it does seem odd that you\u0027d be duplicating creating a blob, rather than just having a blob be passed in...",
