      "message": "I considered this approach, my concern was not to change this dramatically. That is why I choose \"safer\" solution, keeping in-mind M61 merge. Also from performance point of view it is better to set locale at early stage of the boot to reduce number of restarting services. \nI don\u0027t have strong preference here so if you think this is better, I will update the code and create this service once  both conditions are met. I will probably re-use functionality from bluetooth refactoring where we did the similar thing, wait for app and intent helper instances.",

Observing one in ArcSettingsService and the other in ArcSettingsServiceImpl seems a bit difficult to follow.\n\nAs you mentioned, it\u0027s probably a good idea to set locale right after app instance is ready, so let\u0027s continue doing so.\n\nAgain, please feel free to land this.",
