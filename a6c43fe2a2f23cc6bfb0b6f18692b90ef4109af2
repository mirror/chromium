      "message": "Since Windows is hooked via an in-process (in-thread) hook proc, it only sees mouse moves when they\u0027re over a window belonging to the UI thread of the test process. Hooking globally would open up its own can of worms, so I think it\u0027s best that we not do that.\n\nI\u0027ve made a few more changes in the latest Patch Set, which are explained in the CL description. The biggest is that tests will no longer timeout if the mouse move event isn\u0027t received -- they will continue after action_timeout with an appropriate log message. If they fail, we will hopefully see in the log that the mouse move didn\u0027t go as planned.\n\nOnce I started tugging on InputDispatcher, it was hard to stop. I\u0027ve moved the out-of-class statics into the class itself and generally tidied things up a bit (with added comments). One thing I didn\u0027t change is the odd ownership model (AddRef!), but it\u0027s at least documented now. Please don\u0027t ask me to change it. :-)\n\nIn parallel, I\u0027m adding a topmost-window detector to the swarming infrastructure so that we can quarantine bots that suddenly have topmost windows present after a test is run. Since I suspect that some other process is making the bot\u0027s cmd prompt topmost, I hope that this will help us find the culprit.\n\nCheers",
