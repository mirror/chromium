      "message": "Hmm... I wonder if one of the reasons that we didn\u0027t write these is so that we didn\u0027t have a bunch of empty prefs for explicit_host: [].  One way to maintain this same benefit while fixing the bug would be to do something like:\nif (explicit_hosts)\n  SetPref(explicit_hosts)\nelse\n  ErasePref(explicit_hosts)\n\nThat would reduce the necessary size of the prefs file, and might also be *slightly* more performant (since erasing could short-circuit if the pref doesn\u0027t exist [which would be the common case if the new value is empty], and we avoid a write).\n\nOn the other hand, api and manifest permissions both don\u0027t do this, and this code isn\u0027t hit all *that* often.\n\nOverall, I might have a small preference for erasing unnecessary prefs, rather than inserting empty values, but I don\u0027t feel strongly.
