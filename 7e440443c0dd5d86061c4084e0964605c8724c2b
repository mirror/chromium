      "message": "There are wpt that make sure that when a track or transceiver is added, getReceivers() equals that receiver. We have browser_tests for adding and removing tracks, and I\u0027m working on wpt for adding and then removing tracks: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/719615\n\nWe lack test coverage for what happens when you remove remote tracks (track should be removed from stream, track should be muted, onmute should fire). This is being addressed, and the test that I removed here would not have covered that.",
