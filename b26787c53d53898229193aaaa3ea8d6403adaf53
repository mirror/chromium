So I think this is probably an unsafe assumption...\n\nAlso, I wonder if we should write this test using a cross-process frame setup like this:\n               \n           A1\n           / \\\n         A2   B\n\nAnd have B navigate A2 to about:blank. That way, if we change it in the future, we\u0027ll notice this code break and be able to easily track it down and fix it.",
