      "message": "i think i already commented on this -- global non-POD types with dtors are not allowed. that aside, what you have here will result in UnregisterActivator being called on the main thread (most likely) rather than on the MTA notification thread. that doesn\u0027t feel right. i think there should be a clear way that the thread is spun down, even if chrome never does it. can we have some sort of integration test that will spin up the thread, respond to activations, and tear it down?",
