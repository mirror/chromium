Similarly, is it possible that this could somehow be a javascript: URL?\n\n(Though I guess with the unique origin thing, that should still limit the scope of the breakage...)",

      "message": "Thinking this through, I think this is okay. The URL is retrieved from navigation_handle()-\u003eGetURL(), which is a GURL. The string representation of a URL is called the spec(), and GURL comment says: \"Getting the spec will assert if the URL is invalid to help protect against malicious URLs.\"\n\nAdditionally the site can already execute arbitrary JavaScript and navigate to an arbitrary URL, so I don\u0027t think this gives the site any power it doesn\u0027t already have.\n\nThat being said it would still be good to get Nick to also say something.",
