      "message": "This DCHECK relies on Chrome\u0027s BrowserProcess, so it needs to be reworked or just removed.\n\nI could replace this check with DCHECK(!is_shutting_down_) by adding members like:\n\n  void set_is_shutting_down() { is_shutting_down_ \u003d true; }\n  bool is_shutting_down_ \u003d false;\n\nChrome would then call set_is_shutting_down() when shutdown begins. That would catch all cases. (Except if the KeepAliveRegistry singleton is only created after Chrome shutdown begins, but that seems unlikely.)\n\njochen: Would you like me to apply the above refactoring, or is dropping the DCHECK okay?",
