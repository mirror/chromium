You can include the response code in ExtraRequestCompleteInfo, plumbing it through similarly to how you plumbed LoadTimingInfo.",

I had convinced myself that OnStart does the right thing w/rt redirects, but I should have added a test.\n\nI had originally used the resource_type field, but in the one test I did write, it never fired on the main resource, which is why I\u0027m using the URL.\n\nI will write a test that uses redirects and will confirm that OnCommit does the right thing.",

      "message": "Great, thanks for checking!\n\nDo you know if this ends up succeeding for all redirects as well as the final resource? My suspicion is that it will fire for all, whereas I think we only want it to succeed for the final resource in a redirect chain. If that\u0027s the case we probably do want to forward the HTTP response code and only process non-3xx cases. Can we write a browsertest for this case (HTTP redirect) that verifies that the expected callback only gets invoked once, for the final resource in the chain?",
