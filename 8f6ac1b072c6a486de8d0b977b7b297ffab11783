      "message": "In addition to what Dave mentioned offline, please make sure this MouseEvent.h change is /only/ in the very last CL your commit sequence.  This will possibly cause the biggest regression in the web, so you have to be prepared to repeat {revert the last CL, fix the bug, reland the last CL} :(\n\nI know this sounds like a bit of throwaway work (adding temporary truncations like floor() etc only to drop them later on).  But\n- reverting any CL potentially adds a lot of extra work, and\n- anything that changes DOM Mouse events causes regressions, so I will be surprised if you don\u0027t have to revert this MouseEvent.h change a few times.\n\nOther than DOM MouseEvent, you can also consider holding back WebMouseEvent.h changes before all platform-specific fixes have landed.",
