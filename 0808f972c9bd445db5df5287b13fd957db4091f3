      "message": "When we receive a Pause request, we delay reporting BodyReadBeforePaused if there is a pending read with |url_request_|. That is more accurate because we don\u0027t try to stop/cancel that pending read. The result of that pending read (plus results of previous completed reads) should be reported.\n\nTherefore, we wait until the pending read is finished, or |url_request_| is destroyed (this case).",
