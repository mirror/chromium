      "message": "Nit: The name choice here seems odd.  Nothing in the function is really \"md\"-specific, and I\u0027d like to avoid referring to \"md\" in the code anyway where possible since the whole top Chrome should be MD at this point and that\u0027s just the standard Chrome style.\n\nMaybe SetColors() would be a more accurate name?",

      "message": "I struggled with this name a lot. It\u0027s actually creating the button, so I wanted to make sure it was clear it was a setup/init function. However this is the only version of the button that needs to wait for AddedToWidget and needs to be called again, on theme updates (even if that isn\u0027t plumbed yet), so I didn\u0027t want to move the whole button init block in here.\n\nHow about this: SetupThemeColorButton? So it\u0027s clear what the difference between this and the other init block is.",
