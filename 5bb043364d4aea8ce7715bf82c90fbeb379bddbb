If the same text is used in two places, but the text has different meaning in those two places, then they should be duplicated (so translators can write different things if the locale calls for it).",

      "message": "OK - Added a TODO w/ bug in settings_strings.grdp.\n\nI think in practice, they are used to mean the same thing, but the string descriptions are slightly different. For example, I\u0027m pretty sure IDS_PAGE_INFO_BUTTON_TEXT_ALLOWED_BY_USER is used for the \u0027Allow\u0027 string when Flash is set to allow via enterprise policy, despite the string description saying \u0027...explicitly set to allow by the user.\u0027\n\nSo I think there are existing problems with the string descriptions already. The equivalent site settings strings are not so generic though - the \u0027Allow\u0027 there just reads \u0027Label for the menu item to allow permission for a particular site.\u0027\n\nProbably the best course of action here is not to delete the Site settings strings, add a new one for \u0027Ask\u0027 (since the Page Info \u0027Ask\u0027 is for a permission set by the user), and when we get around to doing the string consolidation in https://crbug.com/753173, we should use the more generic string descriptions like the ones that exist in settings_strings.grdp already. I went ahead and did this in the next patchset, but feel free to unresolve this comment if you don\u0027t agree.",
