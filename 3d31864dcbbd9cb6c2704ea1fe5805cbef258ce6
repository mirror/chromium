      "message": "I don\u0027t think this test makes sense to have any more.\n\nIt used to make sense because both permanent and temporary disables were done on a class/static basis so, when we called ShouldBenchmarkBeScheduled on the class, it was checking that the permanent disable would cause a benchmark not to get scheduled, but a temporary disable wouldn\u0027t.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t make sense now because permanent disables are still done on a class/static basis, but temporary disables are done on a object/instance basis. For obvious reasons, there\u0027s no way that these temporary disables could have an effect on whether benchmarks are schedule given that the call looks like:\n\nperf_data_generator.ShouldBenchmarksBeScheduled(\n    RegularBenchmark, \u0027bot_name\u0027, os, None))\n\nwe don\u0027t even pass an instance of the class, so obviously any temporary disables that operate at the instance level can\u0027t have an effect.",
