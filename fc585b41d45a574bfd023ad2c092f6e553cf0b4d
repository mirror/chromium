      "message": "why aren\u0027t these going to ViewAndroid/EventForwarder instead?\n\nThese seem very view specific.  They also don\u0027t relate to existing web_contents.h methods, so I\"m curious how/where this is handled on other platforms.  The strong preference should be to keep this class as a simple java exposed proxy of web_contents.h.  Other things should either be in separate classes where possible, or in the embedder themselves.\n\nFor things that are shared between Chrome and WebView, maybe we should discuss exposing a new package of common shared code that is built upon the core components but doesn\u0027t need a full component/ entry itself.\ncontent/public/glue\ncontent/public/client\n\u003c\u003c\u003c or something \u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nIn this example, I\u0027d rather see a ZoomController class that has three methods that all take a WebContents and do their work.",
