I believe that it\u0027s the procedure now for tearing down the renderer process when user closes the tab, which means that if the tab was sitting in background for a long time and user closed it, we\u0027d lose all the metrics from it.\n\nShould we record the metrics (at least TrafficBytes ones) after completing each request?",
