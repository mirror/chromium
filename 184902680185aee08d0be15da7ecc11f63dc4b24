      "message": "Can you grab a Lumpy and see if it has serial_number defined (I think so)? If yes, then we should remove this one as well.\n\nBut you have to make sure if it\u0027s having different value from serial_number (for example if Product_S/N is 9 digits while serial_number is 10). I remember there were some discussion that few OEMs may try to setup different SNs for their internal management so the \"SN\" was actually different. In otherwords, I wonder why kSerialNumberKey is not the first priority.",

I\u0027ve checked celes, lumpy, pit and winky and it was always the same:\nProduct_S/N\u003d[serial without checksum]\nserial_number\u003d[serial with checksum]\nback of device\u003d[serial with checksum]\n\nThis means we\u0027re reporting the wrong serial number for all Samsung devices! And there\u0027s no way to fix it because existing devices might have used the serial number for enterprise enrollment and thus we cannot change it.\n\nTo my mind the easiest fix would be if Samsung stopped writing \"Product_S/N\" to the VPD. Could we add a factory test that ensures \"Product_S/N\" doesn\u0027t exist?",
