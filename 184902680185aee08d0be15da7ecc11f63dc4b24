If yes, then we should remove this one as well.\n\nBut you have to make sure if it\u0027s having different value from serial_number (for example if Product_S/N is 9 digits while serial_number is 10). I remember there were some discussion that few OEMs may try to setup different SNs for their internal management so the \"SN\" was actually different. In otherwords, I wonder why kSerialNumberKey is not the first priority.",
