Description:
A gradle-specified repository for Android and Java dependencies.

Local Modifications:
Most of the content of this directory is generated by a script:

```
> cd $CHROMIUM_SRC/src
> which gradlew
$CHROMIUM_SRC/src/third_party/gradle_wrapper/gradlew
> gradlew -b tools/android/roll/android_deps/build.gradle setUpRepository
```

See `tools/android/roll/android_deps/README.md` for more information.

The third_party dependencies are under the `repository` directory, and they
each have their own README.
