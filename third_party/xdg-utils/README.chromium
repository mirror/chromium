Description:
This directory contains a copy of xdg-utils obtained from git on 2017-11-20.

Build instructions:
$ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xdg/xdg-utils
$ cd xdg-utils
$ ./configure
$ make
* Remove xdg-* from scripts/.gitignore.
* Update OWNERS and README.chromium as necessary.

We now have this copy only to allow us to ship our own copy of xdg-settings (and
xdg-mime, because we need a newer version than some distributions include). When
these are standard, we can delete our copy.

The license for xdg-utils is in the LICENSE file and is similar to BSD-style.
