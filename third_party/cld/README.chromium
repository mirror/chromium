Description:
The CLD is used to determine the language of text.

This library is open source Google code.  It is currently only
available from the Chromium tree, and not well-documented otherwise.

Local Modifications:
  * Add support for arm64 architecture
  * Remove dead USE_TCMALLOC #define.

DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE. It has been deprecated, all DEPS pointing to
it have been pruned, and there is no guarantee that it compiles,
links or runs any longer.
