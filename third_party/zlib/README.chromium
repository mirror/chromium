Description:
"A massively spiffy yet delicately unobtrusive compression library."

zlib is a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered lossless data-compression
library. zlib implements the "deflate"Â compression algorithm described by RFC
1951, which combines the LZ77 (Lempel-Ziv) algorithm with Huffman coding. zlib
also implements the zlib (RFC 1950) and gzip (RFC 1952) wrapper formats.

Local Modifications:
 - Only source code from the zlib distribution used to build the zlib and
   minizip libraries are present. Many other files have been omitted. Only *.c
   and *.h files from the upstream root directory and contrib/minizip were
   imported.
 - The contents of the google directory are original Chromium-specific
   additions.
 - google.patch contains changes from the upstream version, mostly related to
   the build.
 - inffast64.patch contains optimizations to inffast.c for 64 bit architectures.
   This also adds contrib/inffast64/inffast64.c.
 - Intel SIMD optimisations from https://github.com/jtkukunas/zlib/ have been
   integrated. These changes are reflected in simd.patch.
