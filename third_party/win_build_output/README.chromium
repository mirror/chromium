This directory contains outputs of some tools that run during the chrome/win
build and that exist only as closed-source Windows binaries and that are used
only in very few places of the build, and whose build inputs change almost
never.  By checking in the outputs of these tools, the chrome/win build can
work on non-Windows hosts.
