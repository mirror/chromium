Description:
Closure Library is a powerful, low level JavaScript library designed
for building complex and scalable web applications.

Local Modifications:
Only the files actually used by the scripts in document_image_extractor/src are kept.
This includes a number of JavaScript source files and a few python modules to scan
sources for closure dependencies.

A few cosmetic changes were made to a few closure-library classes so that compilation
would pass with our third_party/closure_compiler/checker.py. See chrome-changes.diff
