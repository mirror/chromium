Description: Robolectric is a unit test framework for Android.
Local Modifications:
- Hardcoded version number in robolectric-version.properties.
- Hardcoded ShadowProvider service config files. These files are normally
  generated at compile time but it is difficult to use the generated file
  with GN.
- Provided stub implementation of MavenDependencyResolver.java to avoid
  needing maven third_party libraries.
