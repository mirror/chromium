How to update or add fonts:

1.  Download fonts from their source repositories, see LICENSE, build them if necessary.
2.  Copy the necessary files to ./content_shell_test_fonts
3.  Verify that the licenses are correctly referenced in LICENSE.
4.  Update the `//third_party/blimp_fonts` target to include all the
    current fonts and their license files.
5.  Run the `upload_to_google_storage.py` (from depot_tools) script to upload
    the files. You must do this in the //third_party/content_shell_fonts directory.
    To do this, execute:
     $ upload_to_google_storage.py --archive -b chromium-fonts content_shell_test_fonts
6.  Add all the font_bundle.tar.gz.sha1 file to the chromium src repository,
    by executing the following command:
     $ git add ./third_party/content_shell_fonts/content_shell_test_fonts.tar.gz.sha1
