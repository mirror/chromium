PASS a.bounds.top is b.bounds.top
PASS a.bounds.right is b.bounds.right
PASS a.bounds.bottom is b.bounds.bottom
PASS a.bounds.left is b.bounds.left
PASS a.intersection.top is b.intersection.top
PASS a.intersection.right is b.intersection.right
PASS a.intersection.bottom is b.intersection.bottom
PASS a.intersection.left is b.intersection.left
PASS a.rootBounds.top is b.rootBounds.top
PASS a.rootBounds.right is b.rootBounds.right
PASS a.rootBounds.bottom is b.rootBounds.bottom
PASS a.rootBounds.left is b.rootBounds.left
