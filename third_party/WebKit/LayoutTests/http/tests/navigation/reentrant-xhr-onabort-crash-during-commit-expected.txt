This test creates a child iframe, which creates a grandchild iframe, which in turn creates a slow XHR then reloads. During commit for the reload, the slow XHR is cancelled, and the XHR's onabort handler in turn creates a new XHR, which is then aborted slightly later during the commit process. This second XHR's onabort handler then navigates the top frame to about:blank synchronously. This will cause the grandchild to detach in the middle of commit, and shouldn't crash. This top frame exists as a wrapper to handle calling testRunner.notifyDone(), because by the time the crash occurs the other frames can't: the child has committed about:blank and the grandchild is detached.
