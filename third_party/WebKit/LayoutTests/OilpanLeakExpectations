# This file is used for tests that only need to be suppressed on the Chromium
# WebKit Leak bots.
#
# This list isn't comprehensive yet, and Leak Detector bots are not tree closers atm.
# Gardeners are welcome to touch this file, but you can ignore the failures
# and wait for kouhei@ or hajimehoshi@ to maintain this file.
#
# Also, while Oilpan is enabled on ToT it will not read leak expectations from this
# file. So gardeners, put Oilpan leak expectations in LeakExpectations in a section
# labelled "Oilpan" or some such.
