This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL AnimationNode.before() does nothing if the node has no parent animation group. HierarchyRequestError is not thrown in call node.before(null) Animation is not defined
FAIL AnimationNode.before() does nothing if the node has no parent animation group. No HierarchyRequestError is thrown if the node is inserted before itself Animation is not defined
FAIL AnimationNode.before() does nothing if there is no parent animation group Animation is not defined
FAIL HierarchyRequestError is thrown if node is inserted before itself AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL HierarchyRequestError is thrown if direct parent is inserted before the node AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL HierarchyRequestError is thrown if an inclusive ancestor is inserted before the node AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL HierarchyRequestError is thrown if an inclusive ancestor is inserted before the node. Test several arguments in before() call AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL AnimationNode.before() inserts nodes before this node AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL AnimationNode.before() inserts nodes before this node. Inserted node is on the same level in the tree AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL Test AnimationNode.before() inserts node before this node even if inserted node is already before this one AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL Test AnimationNode.before() inserts node before this node. The previous position of the inserted node is deeper in the tree than current node AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL Test AnimationNode.before() inserts node before this node. The previous position of the inserted node is shallower in the tree than current node, but not ancestor AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL Test AnimationNode.before() inserts several nodes before this node AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL Test AnimationNode.before() inserts several nodes before this node, duplicate nodes are ignored AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL Test AnimationNode.before() inserts several nodes before this node, check insertion order AnimationGroup is not defined
FAIL Test AnimationNode.before() disassociates the inserted node from the player, if node is directly associated with a player AnimationGroup is not defined
Harness: the test ran to completion.
