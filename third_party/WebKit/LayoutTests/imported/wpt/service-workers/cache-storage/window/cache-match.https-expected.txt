PASS Cache.match with no matching entries 
PASS Cache.match with URL 
PASS Cache.match with Request 
PASS Cache.match with new Request 
PASS Cache.match with ignoreSearch option (request with no search parameters) 
PASS Cache.match with ignoreSearch option (request with search parameter) 
PASS Cache.match with URL containing fragment 
PASS Cache.match with string fragment "http" as query 
PASS Cache.match with responses containing "Vary" header
