This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL close() fires a close event assert_true: close event should be queued expected true got false
FAIL close() on a <dialog> that doesn't have an open attribute aborts the steps Failed to execute 'close' on 'HTMLDialogElement': The element does not have an 'open' attribute, and therefore cannot be closed.
PASS close() removes the open attribute and set the returnValue to the first argument 
PASS close() without argument removes the open attribute and there's no returnValue 
PASS close() should set the returnValue IDL attribute but not the JS property 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
