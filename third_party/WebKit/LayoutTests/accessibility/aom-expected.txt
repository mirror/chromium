This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS DOM Elements have an AccessibleNode 
PASS DOM Text nodes do not have an AccessibleNode. 
FAIL Supported properties on an AccessibleNode are all null by default Cannot read property 'role' of undefined
FAIL ARIA attributes are reflected into AOM properties Cannot read property 'role' of undefined
FAIL Invalid ARIA roles are still reflected into AOM properties Cannot read property 'role' of undefined
FAIL Test setting AccessibleNode.role Cannot set property 'role' of undefined
FAIL An invalid role should be ignored if there's no ARIA. Cannot set property 'role' of undefined
FAIL Fallback roles are supported. Cannot set property 'role' of undefined
FAIL Test setting AccessibleNode.label Cannot set property 'label' of undefined
FAIL Test that AOM properties override ARIA attributes Cannot set property 'role' of undefined
FAIL Once an AOM property has been set, ARIA no longer has any effect Cannot set property 'role' of undefined
FAIL An AccessibleNode keeps its element alive. Cannot read property 'role' of undefined
