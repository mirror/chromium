PASS desiredSize on a released writer 
PASS desiredSize initial value 
PASS desiredSize on a writer for a closed stream 
PASS desiredSize on a writer for an errored stream 
PASS ws.getWriter() on a closing WritableStream 
PASS ws.getWriter() on a closed WritableStream 
PASS ws.getWriter() on an aborted WritableStream 
PASS ws.getWriter() on an errored WritableStream 
PASS closed and ready on a released writer 
PASS WritableStream should call underlying sink methods as methods 
PASS methods should not not have .apply() or .call() called 
PASS WritableStream's strategy.size should not be called as a method 
PASS redundant releaseLock() is no-op 
FAIL ready promise should fire before closed on releaseLock assert_array_equals: ready promise should fire before closed promise property 0, expected "ready" but got "closed"
