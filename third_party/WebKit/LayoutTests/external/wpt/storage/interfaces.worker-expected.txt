This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Storage API IDL test 
PASS Navigator interface: existence and properties of interface object 
FAIL WorkerNavigator interface: attribute storage assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "storage" expected true got false
PASS StorageManager interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS StorageManager interface object length 
PASS StorageManager interface object name 
FAIL StorageManager interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: class string of StorageManager.prototype expected "[object StorageManagerPrototype]" but got "[object StorageManager]"
PASS StorageManager interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS StorageManager interface: operation persisted() 
PASS StorageManager interface: member persist 
PASS StorageManager interface: operation estimate() 
FAIL StorageManager must be primary interface of navigator.storage assert_equals: wrong typeof object expected "object" but got "undefined"
FAIL Stringification of navigator.storage assert_equals: wrong typeof object expected "object" but got "undefined"
FAIL StorageManager interface: navigator.storage must inherit property "persisted" with the proper type (0) assert_equals: wrong typeof object expected "object" but got "undefined"
FAIL StorageManagerinterface: navigator.storagemust not have property "persist" Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'persist' in undefined
FAIL StorageManager interface: navigator.storage must inherit property "estimate" with the proper type (2) assert_equals: wrong typeof object expected "object" but got "undefined"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
