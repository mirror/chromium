This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Storage API IDL test 
PASS Navigator interface: attribute storage 
PASS WorkerNavigator interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS StorageManager interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS StorageManager interface object length 
PASS StorageManager interface object name 
FAIL StorageManager interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: class string of StorageManager.prototype expected "[object StorageManagerPrototype]" but got "[object StorageManager]"
PASS StorageManager interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS StorageManager interface: operation persisted() 
PASS StorageManager interface: operation persist() 
PASS StorageManager interface: operation estimate() 
PASS StorageManager must be primary interface of navigator.storage 
PASS Stringification of navigator.storage 
PASS StorageManager interface: navigator.storage must inherit property "persisted" with the proper type (0) 
PASS StorageManager interface: navigator.storage must inherit property "persist" with the proper type (1) 
PASS StorageManager interface: navigator.storage must inherit property "estimate" with the proper type (2) 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
