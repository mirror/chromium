This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS DOMMatrix constructor with string argument in worker 
FAIL DOMMatrix stringifier in worker (2d identity) assert_equals: expected "[object DOMMatrix]" but got "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)"
FAIL DOMMatrix stringifier in worker (3d identity) assert_equals: expected "[object DOMMatrix]" but got "matrix3d(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)"
FAIL DOMMatrix stringifier in worker (non-finite values) assert_equals: expected "[object DOMMatrix]" but got "matrix(1, 0, 0, nan, inf, -inf)"
PASS DOMMatrixReadOnly constructor with string argument in worker 
FAIL DOMMatrixReadOnly stringifier in worker (2d identity) assert_equals: expected "[object DOMMatrixReadOnly]" but got "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)"
FAIL DOMMatrixReadOnly stringifier in worker (3d identity) assert_equals: expected "[object DOMMatrixReadOnly]" but got "matrix3d(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)"
FAIL DOMMatrixReadOnly stringifier in worker (non-finite values) assert_equals: expected "[object DOMMatrixReadOnly]" but got "matrix(1, 0, 0, nan, inf, -inf)"
FAIL DOMMatrix setMatrixValue in worker assert_false: on prototype expected false got true
Harness: the test ran to completion.
