This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS DelayNode interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS DelayNode interface object length 
PASS DelayNode interface object name 
FAIL DelayNode interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: class string of DelayNode.prototype expected "[object DelayNodePrototype]" but got "[object DelayNode]"
PASS DelayNode interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS DelayNode interface: attribute delayTime 
PASS DelayNode must be primary interface of delay_node 
PASS Stringification of delay_node
