PASS Navigator interface: attribute mediaCapabilities 
PASS Navigator must be primary interface of navigator 
PASS Stringification of navigator 
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "mediaCapabilities" with the proper type (0) 
PASS WorkerNavigator interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS MediaDecodingAbility interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS MediaDecodingAbility interface object length 
PASS MediaDecodingAbility interface object name 
FAIL MediaDecodingAbility interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: class string of MediaDecodingAbility.prototype expected "[object MediaDecodingAbilityPrototype]" but got "[object MediaDecodingAbility]"
PASS MediaDecodingAbility interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS MediaDecodingAbility interface: attribute supported
