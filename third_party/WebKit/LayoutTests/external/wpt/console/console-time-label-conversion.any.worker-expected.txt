This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL console.time()'s label gets converted to string via label.toString() when label is an object assert_true: toString() must be called on time()'s label when label is an object expected true got false
FAIL console.timeEnd()'s label gets converted to string via label.toString() when label is an object assert_true: toString() must be called on timeEnd()'s label when label is an object expected true got false
FAIL console.time() throws exceptions generated by erroneous label.toString() conversion assert_throws: time() must re-throw any exceptions thrown by label.toString() conversion function "() => {
    console.time({
      toString() {
        throw new Error("conversion error");
      }
    });
  }" did not throw
FAIL console.timeEnd() throws exceptions generated by erroneous label.toString() conversion assert_throws: timeEnd() must re-throw any exceptions thrown by label.toString() conversion function "() => {
    console.timeEnd({
      toString() {
        throw new Error("conversion error");
      }
    });
  }" did not throw
Harness: the test ran to completion.
