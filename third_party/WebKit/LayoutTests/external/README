The test suites in this directory are synced with third-party repos.

In particular the tests in wpt and csswg-test are imported from the
W3C's test suite repositories on GitHub, and changes to wpt tests
are automatically upstreamed to the GitHub repo within 24 hours.

Use Tools/Scripts/wpt-import to update the tests from the tip of tree
in those repositories.

It is safe and okay to check in generic baselines for any tests that fail.
The baselines will not be overwritten or upstreamed.

For more information on this process and Blink's handling of the W3C's
test suites, see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md.
