This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Video bitrate OK 
PASS Video bitrate clamped to minimum 
PASS Video bitrate explicitly set to 0 is clamped 
PASS Audio bitrate OK 
PASS Audio bitrate clamped to minimum 
PASS Audio bitrate clamped to maximum 
PASS Audio bitrate explicitly 0 is clamped 
PASS Unspecified bitrates are not clamped 
PASS Video and audio bitrates OK 
PASS Overall bitrate OK (divided 90/10 video/audio) 
PASS Overall bitrate OK, w/ explicit video bitrate ignored 
PASS Overall bitrate OK, w/ explicit audio bitrate ignored 
PASS Overall bitrate leads to audio clamped to its maximum 
PASS Overall bitrate leads to video clamped to its minimum 
PASS Overall bitrate leads to both audio and video clamped to min 
PASS Overall bitrate 0 overrides specified video bitrate 
PASS Overall bitrate 0 overrides specified audio bitrate 
PASS Overall bitrate too large is clamped 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
