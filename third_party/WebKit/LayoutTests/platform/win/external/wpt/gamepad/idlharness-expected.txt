This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Navigator interface: operation getGamepads() 
PASS Navigator must be primary interface of navigator 
PASS Stringification of navigator 
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "getGamepads" with the proper type (0) 
PASS Gamepad interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS Gamepad interface object length 
PASS Gamepad interface object name 
FAIL Gamepad interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: class string of Gamepad.prototype expected "[object GamepadPrototype]" but got "[object Gamepad]"
PASS Gamepad interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS Gamepad interface: attribute id 
PASS Gamepad interface: attribute index 
PASS Gamepad interface: attribute connected 
PASS Gamepad interface: attribute timestamp 
PASS Gamepad interface: attribute mapping 
PASS Gamepad interface: attribute axes 
PASS Gamepad interface: attribute buttons 
PASS GamepadButton interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS GamepadButton interface object length 
PASS GamepadButton interface object name 
FAIL GamepadButton interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: class string of GamepadButton.prototype expected "[object GamepadButtonPrototype]" but got "[object GamepadButton]"
PASS GamepadButton interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS GamepadButton interface: attribute pressed 
PASS GamepadButton interface: attribute value 
PASS GamepadEvent interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS GamepadEvent interface object length 
PASS GamepadEvent interface object name 
FAIL GamepadEvent interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: class string of GamepadEvent.prototype expected "[object GamepadEventPrototype]" but got "[object GamepadEvent]"
PASS GamepadEvent interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS GamepadEvent interface: attribute gamepad 
PASS GamepadEvent must be primary interface of [object GamepadEvent] 
PASS Stringification of [object GamepadEvent] 
PASS GamepadEvent interface: [object GamepadEvent] must inherit property "gamepad" with the proper type (0) 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
