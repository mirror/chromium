PASS Window interface: operation requestIdleCallback(IdleRequestCallback,IdleRequestOptions) 
PASS Window interface: operation cancelIdleCallback(unsigned long) 
PASS Window must be primary interface of window 
PASS Stringification of window 
PASS Window interface: window must inherit property "requestIdleCallback" with the proper type (0) 
PASS Window interface: calling requestIdleCallback(IdleRequestCallback,IdleRequestOptions) on window with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Window interface: window must inherit property "cancelIdleCallback" with the proper type (1) 
PASS Window interface: calling cancelIdleCallback(unsigned long) on window with too few arguments must throw TypeError
