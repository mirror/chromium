This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS unhandledrejection: from Promise.reject 
PASS unhandledrejection: from a synchronous rejection in new Promise 
PASS unhandledrejection: from a task-delayed rejection 
PASS unhandledrejection: from a setTimeout-delayed rejection 
PASS unhandledrejection: from a throw in a rejection handler chained off of Promise.reject 
PASS unhandledrejection: from a throw in a rejection handler chained off of a setTimeout-delayed rejection 
PASS unhandledrejection: from a throw in a rejection handler attached one microtask after a setTimeout-delayed rejection 
PASS unhandledrejection: from returning a Promise.reject-created rejection in a fulfillment handler 
PASS unhandledrejection: from a throw in a fulfillment handler 
PASS unhandledrejection: from returning a setTimeout-delayed rejection in a fulfillment handler 
PASS unhandledrejection: from Promise.reject, indirected through Promise.all 
PASS no unhandledrejection/rejectionhandled: rejection handler attached synchronously to a promise from Promise.reject 
PASS no unhandledrejection/rejectionhandled: rejection handler attached synchronously to a promise from Promise.reject, indirecting through Promise.all 
PASS no unhandledrejection/rejectionhandled: rejection handler attached synchronously to a synchronously-rejected promise created with new Promise 
PASS no unhandledrejection/rejectionhandled: rejection handler attached synchronously to a promise created from throwing in a fulfillment handler 
PASS no unhandledrejection/rejectionhandled: rejection handler attached synchronously to a promise created from returning a Promise.reject-created promise in a fulfillment handler 
PASS no unhandledrejection/rejectionhandled: rejection handler attached synchronously to a promise created from returning a setTimeout-delayed rejection in a fulfillment handler 
PASS no unhandledrejection/rejectionhandled: all inside a queued task, a rejection handler attached synchronously to a promise created from returning a Promise.reject-created promise in a fulfillment handler 
PASS delayed handling: a microtask delay before attaching a handler prevents both events (Promise.reject-created promise) 
PASS delayed handling: a microtask delay before attaching a handler prevents both events (immediately-rejected new Promise-created promise) 
PASS delayed handling: a microtask delay before attaching the handler, and before rejecting the promise, indirected through Promise.all 
PASS microtask nesting: attaching a handler inside a combination of mutationObserverMicrotask + promise microtasks 
PASS microtask nesting: attaching a handler inside a combination of mutationObserverMicrotask + promise microtasks, all inside a postMessageTask 
PASS microtask nesting: attaching a handler inside a combination of mutationObserverMicrotask + promise microtasks, all inside a setTimeout 
PASS microtask nesting: attaching a handler inside a combination of promise microtasks + mutationObserverMicrotask 
PASS microtask nesting: attaching a handler inside a combination of promise microtasks + mutationObserverMicrotask, all inside a postMessageTask 
PASS microtask nesting: attaching a handler inside a combination of promise microtasks + mutationObserverMicrotask, all inside a setTimeout 
PASS delayed handling: a task delay before attaching a handler prevents unhandledrejection 
PASS delayed handling: postMessageTask after promise creation/rejection, plus promise microtasks, is not too late to attach a rejection handler 
PASS delayed handling: postMessageTask before promise creation/rejection, plus many promise microtasks, is not too late to attach a rejection handler 
PASS delayed handling: postMessageTask after promise creation/rejection, plus many promise microtasks, is not too late to attach a rejection handler 
PASS delayed handling: a nested-task delay before attaching a handler causes unhandledrejection 
PASS delayed handling: a nested-postMessageTask after promise creation/rejection, plus promise microtasks, is too late to attach a rejection handler 
PASS delayed handling: a nested-postMessageTask before promise creation/rejection, plus many promise microtasks, is too late to attach a rejection handler 
PASS delayed handling: a nested-postMessageTask after promise creation/rejection, plus many promise microtasks, is too late to attach a rejection handler 
PASS delayed handling: delaying handling by setTimeout(,10) will cause both events to fire 
PASS mutationObserverMicrotask vs. postMessageTask ordering is not disturbed inside unhandledrejection events 
PASS postMessageTask ordering vs. the task queued for unhandled rejection notification (1) 
PASS postMessageTask ordering vs. the task queued for unhandled rejection notification (2) 
PASS rejectionhandled is dispatched from a queued task, and not immediately 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
