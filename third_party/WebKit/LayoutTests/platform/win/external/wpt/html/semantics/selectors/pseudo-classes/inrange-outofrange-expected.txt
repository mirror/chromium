PASS ':out-of-range' matches all elements that are candidates for constraint validation, have range limitations, and that are either suffering from an underflow or suffering from an overflow 
PASS ':in-range' update number1's value < min 
PASS ':out-of-range' update number1's value < min 
PASS ':in-range' update number3's min < value 
PASS ':out-of-range' update number3's min < value
