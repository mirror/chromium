This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS The referrer URL is origin when a
                                 document served over http requires an http
                                 sub-resource via xhr-request using the meta-referrer
                                 delivery method with keep-origin-redirect and when
                                 the target request is cross-origin. 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
