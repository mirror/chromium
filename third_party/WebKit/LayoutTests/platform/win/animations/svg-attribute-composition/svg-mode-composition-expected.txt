This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS This test uses interpolation-test.js. 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <mode> with underlying [multiply] from add [screen] to add [lighten] at (0) is [screen] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <mode> with underlying [multiply] from add [screen] to add [lighten] at (0.2) is [screen] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <mode> with underlying [multiply] from add [screen] to add [lighten] at (0.6) is [lighten] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <mode> with underlying [multiply] from add [screen] to add [lighten] at (1) is [lighten] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <mode> with underlying [multiply] from add [screen] to add [lighten] at (-2.4) is [screen]
