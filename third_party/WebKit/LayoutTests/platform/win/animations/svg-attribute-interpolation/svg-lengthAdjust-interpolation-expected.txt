This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS This test uses interpolation-test.js. 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <lengthAdjust> from replace [spacing] to replace [spacingAndGlyphs] at (0) is [spacing] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <lengthAdjust> from replace [spacing] to replace [spacingAndGlyphs] at (0.2) is [spacing] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <lengthAdjust> from replace [spacing] to replace [spacingAndGlyphs] at (0.6) is [spacingAndGlyphs] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <lengthAdjust> from replace [spacing] to replace [spacingAndGlyphs] at (1) is [spacingAndGlyphs] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <lengthAdjust> from replace [spacing] to replace [spacingAndGlyphs] at (-0.4) is [spacing] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <lengthAdjust> from replace [spacing] to replace [spacingAndGlyphs] at (0) is [spacing] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <lengthAdjust> from replace [spacing] to replace [spacingAndGlyphs] at (0.2) is [spacing] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <lengthAdjust> from replace [spacing] to replace [spacingAndGlyphs] at (0.6) is [spacingAndGlyphs] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <lengthAdjust> from replace [spacing] to replace [spacingAndGlyphs] at (1) is [spacingAndGlyphs] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <lengthAdjust> from replace [spacing] to replace [spacingAndGlyphs] at (1.4) is [spacingAndGlyphs]
