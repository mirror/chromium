This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS This test uses interpolation-test.js. 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <intercept> from replace [-1] to replace [1.5] at (0) is [-1] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <intercept> from replace [-1] to replace [1.5] at (0.2) is [-0.5] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <intercept> from replace [-1] to replace [1.5] at (0.6) is [0.5] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <intercept> from replace [-1] to replace [1.5] at (1) is [1.5] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <intercept> from replace [-1] to replace [1.5] at (-0.4) is [-2]
