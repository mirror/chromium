This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS This test uses interpolation-test.js. 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <kernelMatrix> from replace [1, 2, 3] to replace [6, 12, 18] at (0) is [1, 2, 3] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <kernelMatrix> from replace [1, 2, 3] to replace [6, 12, 18] at (0.2) is [2, 4, 6] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <kernelMatrix> from replace [1, 2, 3] to replace [6, 12, 18] at (0.6) is [4, 8, 12] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <kernelMatrix> from replace [1, 2, 3] to replace [6, 12, 18] at (1) is [6, 12, 18]
