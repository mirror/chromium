This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS This test uses interpolation-test.js. 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <offset> from replace [-2.5] to replace [7.5] at (0) is [-2.5] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <offset> from replace [-2.5] to replace [7.5] at (0.2) is [-0.5] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <offset> from replace [-2.5] to replace [7.5] at (0.6) is [3.5] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <offset> from replace [-2.5] to replace [7.5] at (1) is [7.5] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <offset> from replace [-2.5] to replace [7.5] at (-0.4) is [-6.5] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <offset> from replace [-2.5] to replace [7.5] at (0) is [-2.5] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <offset> from replace [-2.5] to replace [7.5] at (0.2) is [-0.5] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <offset> from replace [-2.5] to replace [7.5] at (0.6) is [3.5] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <offset> from replace [-2.5] to replace [7.5] at (1) is [7.5] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <offset> from replace [-2.5] to replace [7.5] at (1.4) is [11.5]
