This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS This test uses interpolation-test.js. 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <spacing> from replace [auto] to replace [exact] at (0) is [auto] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <spacing> from replace [auto] to replace [exact] at (0.2) is [auto] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <spacing> from replace [auto] to replace [exact] at (0.6) is [exact] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <spacing> from replace [auto] to replace [exact] at (1) is [exact] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <spacing> from replace [auto] to replace [exact] at (-2.4) is [auto] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <spacing> from replace [auto] to replace [exact] at (0) is [auto] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <spacing> from replace [auto] to replace [exact] at (0.2) is [auto] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <spacing> from replace [auto] to replace [exact] at (0.6) is [exact] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <spacing> from replace [auto] to replace [exact] at (1) is [exact] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <spacing> from replace [auto] to replace [exact] at (3.4) is [exact]
