This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS The return value of AudioParam.setValueAtTime() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true. 
PASS The return value of AudioParam.linearRampToValueAtTime() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true. 
PASS The return value of AudioParam.exponentialRampToValueAtTime() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true. 
PASS The return value of AudioParam.setTargetAtTime() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true. 
PASS The return value of AudioParam.setValueCurveAtTime() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true. 
PASS The return value of AudioParam.cancelScheduledValues() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true. 
PASS Calling setValueAtTime() with a negative end time threw InvalidAccessError: Failed to execute 'setValueAtTime' on 'AudioParam': Time must be a finite non-negative number: -1. 
PASS Calling exponentialRampToValueAtTime() with a zero target value threw InvalidAccessError: Failed to execute 'exponentialRampToValueAtTime' on 'AudioParam': The float target value provided (0) should not be in the range (-1.40130e-45, 1.40130e-45).. 
PASS The gain value of the first gain node is equal to 1. 
PASS The gain value of the second gain node is equal to 0.5. 
PASS The rendered envelope equals [0,0.000125,0.00025,0.000375,0.0005,...] with an element-wise tolerance of 0.0000040532. 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
