This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS buffer.getChannelData(0) === buffer.getChannelData(0) is equal to true. 
PASS buffer.getChannelData(1) === buffer.getChannelData(1) is equal to true. 
PASS getChannelData correctly returned the same buffer. 
PASS buffer1.getChannelData(0) === buffer2.getChannelData(0) is equal to false. 
PASS buffer1.getChannelData(1) === buffer2.getChannelData(1) is equal to false. 
PASS getChannelData correctly returned different buffers. 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
