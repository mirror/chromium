PASS buffer.getChannelData(3) threw IndexSizeError: Failed to execute 'getChannelData' on 'AudioBuffer': channel index (3) exceeds number of channels (3). 
PASS AudioBuffer constructed correctly. 
PASS c1 result is identical to the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,...]. 
PASS c2 result is identical to the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,...]. 
PASS AudioBuffer shared between two different contexts correctly.
