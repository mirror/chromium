This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS localTime and currentIteration are null when the KeyframeEffect is not associated with an Animation 
PASS ComputedTimingProperties.localTime and ComputedTimingProperties.currentIteration return reasonable values when an keyframeEffect is in effect 
PASS ComputedTimingProperties.currentIteration is null when keyframeEffect is not in effect 
PASS ComputedTimingProperties startTime, endTime, duration, activeDuration are sensible for a simple keyframeEffect 
PASS ComputedTimingProperties startTime, endTime, duration, activeDuration are sensible for keyframeEffects with delays and iterations 
PASS ComputedTimingProperties duration is calculated when no duration is specified 
PASS Restricted double attributes on the AnimationEffectTiming interface throws for non-finite values. 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
