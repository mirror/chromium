CONSOLE ERROR: Fetch API cannot load https://localhost:8443/serviceworker/resources/redirect.php?Redirect=https://localhost:8443/fetch/resources/fetch-status.php?status=200. Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'https://127.0.0.1:8443' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
