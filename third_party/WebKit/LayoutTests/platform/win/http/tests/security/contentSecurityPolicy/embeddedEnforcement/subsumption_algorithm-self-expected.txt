This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS 'self' is `localhost` in this case so iframe should be blocked. 
PASS 'self' is `127.0.0.1` in this case so iframe should be blocked. 
PASS Exact match of returned csp to required csp should load iframe. 
PASS 'self' refers to `http://localhost:8000`. 
PASS Multiple sources with locahost should still allow iframe to load since it is more restrictive. 
PASS Iframe's returned csp is less restrictive. 
PASS Iframe's returned csp is again less restrictive. 
PASS Protocol of 'self' matches https:// of the required csp 
PASS Ports of 'self' have to match. 
PASS 'self' can be matched to the actual origin. 
PASS 'self' can be matched to the actual origin despite order. 
PASS 'self' can be matched to the actual origin with the port. 
PASS Repetitions of sources should not influence subsumption . 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
