CONSOLE ERROR: line 32: Fetch API cannot load http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/resources/cors-script.php?value=ran&cors=*. Request mode is "same-origin" but the URL's origin is not same as the request origin http-so://foobar.127.0.0.1:8000.
CONSOLE ERROR: Fetch API cannot load http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/resources/cors-script.php?value=ran. The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' that is not equal to the supplied origin. Origin 'http-so://foobar.127.0.0.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access. Have the server send the header with a valid value, or, if an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
