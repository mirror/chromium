This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS This test uses interpolation-test.js. 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <type> from replace [saturate] to replace [hueRotate] at (0) is [saturate] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <type> from replace [saturate] to replace [hueRotate] at (0.2) is [saturate] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <type> from replace [saturate] to replace [hueRotate] at (0.6) is [hueRotate] 
PASS SMIL: Interpolate attribute <type> from replace [saturate] to replace [hueRotate] at (1) is [hueRotate] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <type> from replace [saturate] to replace [hueRotate] at (-0.4) is [saturate] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <type> from replace [saturate] to replace [hueRotate] at (0) is [saturate] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <type> from replace [saturate] to replace [hueRotate] at (0.2) is [saturate] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <type> from replace [saturate] to replace [hueRotate] at (0.6) is [hueRotate] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <type> from replace [saturate] to replace [hueRotate] at (1) is [hueRotate] 
PASS Web Animations: Interpolate attribute <type> from replace [saturate] to replace [hueRotate] at (1.4) is [hueRotate] 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
