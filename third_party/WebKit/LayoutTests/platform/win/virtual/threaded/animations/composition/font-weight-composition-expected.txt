This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS This test uses interpolation-test.js. 
PASS Compositing: property <font-weight> underlying [500] from add [100] to add [500] at (-0.3) is [500] 
PASS Compositing: property <font-weight> underlying [500] from add [100] to add [500] at (0) is [600] 
PASS Compositing: property <font-weight> underlying [500] from add [100] to add [500] at (0.5) is [800] 
PASS Compositing: property <font-weight> underlying [500] from add [100] to add [500] at (1) is [900] 
PASS Compositing: property <font-weight> underlying [500] from add [100] to add [500] at (1.5) is [900] 
PASS Compositing: property <font-weight> underlying [200] from add [600] to replace [500] at (-0.3) is [900] 
PASS Compositing: property <font-weight> underlying [200] from add [600] to replace [500] at (0) is [800] 
PASS Compositing: property <font-weight> underlying [200] from add [600] to replace [500] at (0.5) is [bold] 
PASS Compositing: property <font-weight> underlying [200] from add [600] to replace [500] at (1) is [500] 
PASS Compositing: property <font-weight> underlying [200] from add [600] to replace [500] at (1.5) is [normal]
