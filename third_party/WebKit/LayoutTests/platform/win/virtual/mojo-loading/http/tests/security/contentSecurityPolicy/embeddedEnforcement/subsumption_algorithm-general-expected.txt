This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS If there is no required csp, the page should load. 
PASS Iframe with empty CSP should be blocked. 
PASS Iframe with matching CSP should load. 
PASS Iframe with more restricting CSP should load. 
PASS Iframe with less restricting CSP should be blocked. 
PASS Iframe with a different CSP should be blocked. 
PASS Iframe with a matching and more restrictive ports should load. 
PASS Iframe must load even if the ports are different but are default for the protocols. 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
