CONSOLE ERROR: Access to Image at 'http://localhost:8000/security/resources/abe-allow-star.php?count=3' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' has been blocked by CORS policy: The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header in the response must not be the wildcard '*' when the request's credentials mode is 'include'. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access.
