This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Constructed MouseEvent timestamp should be high resolution and have the same time origin as performance.now()
FAIL Constructed KeyboardEvent timestamp should be high resolution and have the same time origin as performance.now() assert_greater_than_equal: Event timestamp should be greater than performance.now() timestamp taken before its creation expected a number greater than or equal to 22.100000001955777 but got 22.0999999983178
PASS Constructed WheelEvent timestamp should be high resolution and have the same time origin as performance.now()
PASS Constructed GamepadEvent timestamp should be high resolution and have the same time origin as performance.now()
PASS Constructed FocusEvent timestamp should be high resolution and have the same time origin as performance.now()
