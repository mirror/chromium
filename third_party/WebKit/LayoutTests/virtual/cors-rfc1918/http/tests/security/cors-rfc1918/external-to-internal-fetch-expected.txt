CONSOLE ERROR: Failed to load http://localhost:8080/security/cors-rfc1918/resources/preflight.php?preflight=fail-with-500&out=json: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 500. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
