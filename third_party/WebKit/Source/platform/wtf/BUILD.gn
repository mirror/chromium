# The below is a temporary setup during the WTF migration project:
# https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/tLdAZCTlcAA/bYXVT8gYCAAJ
#
# We are moving wtf/ files to platform/wtf/ incrementally, thus, conceptually,
# the "wtf" target in wtf/BUILD.gn is being split into two, in a way that
# only wtf/ can refer the contents in platform/wtf/.
#
# To achieve this, we introduce a new target "platform_wtf" here, and configure
# it so the source files are compiled in the same way as the original "wtf"
# target. This gn file should only be used from wtf/BUILD.gn, and this
# restriction is enforced by the visibility rule below (but it's okay to
# #include a header in this directory from core/ or modules/).
#
# The following configurations are mostly copied from wtf/BUILD.gn, so we
# can build the source files in the same way.
#
# When we finish moving all the files, "platform_wtf" target will take over
# the role of "wtf".
#
# TODO(yutak): Set up platform_wtf_unittests in the similar manner.
