Security Critical: no

Description:
The Guava project contains several of Google's core libraries.

This file and the COPYING license file are currently just a placeholders,
as guava was removed in: https://codereview.chromium.org/574103002/.
Because DEPS are not automatically removed on all bots, this file needs to stay
around until they do, to make the android_aosp bot happy, since it has a
requirement for license information for all directories in third_party. The
current COPYING file is a copy of the one from the guava repository.
See http://crbug.com/380688 for details.
TODO(nyquist): Remove this file when http://crbug.com/380688 has been fixed.

Local Modifications:
None.
