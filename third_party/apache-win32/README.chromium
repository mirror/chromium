Description:

This is a checked-in copy of Apache2 with OpenSSL and PHP5 for Win32.
It is used by the Blink layout tests.

To update, you'll need to fetch Apache2 and PHP5. https://www.apache.org no
longer hosts binaries of the latest stable version, but you can find Apache2
win32 binaries in other places, such as https://www.apachehaus.com/.
PHP5 can be found at http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/archives/.

To update:

1. Go to the Chromium third_party directory and back up apache-win32,
   for example by renaming it as apache-win32.bak.

2. Download Apache2, unpack, and move to "apache-win32". This directory
   should contain metadata files and bin/ and modules/ subdirectories.

3. Copy README.chromium and remove_files_not_needed_for_chromium.sh
   to the new apache-win32 directory.

4. Download PHP5 and unpack; copy "php5ts.dll "to bin/ and copy
   "php5apache2_*.dll" to modules/.

5. Verify that Apache2 works, for example by running "run-blink-httpd"
   in the Blink tools directory. Update the win-httpd.conf configuration
   file if necessary.

6. Delete files that aren't need for Chromium using
   remove_files_not_needed_for_chromium.sh.

7. Upload the executables and DLLs to Google Storage, to the
   chromium-apache-win32 bucket. See http://g.co/bugatrooper in order to get
   permission to upload. Upload all exe, dll and so binaries, e.g.:

   % find apache-win32/bin -name '*.exe' -o -name '*.dll' -o -name '*.so' | upload_to_google_storage.py --bucket chromium-apache-win32 -
   % find apache-win32/modules -name '*.so' -o -name '*.dll' | upload_to_google_storage.py --bucket chromium-apache-win32 -

8. Then prune the files that were uploaded:

   % find apache-win32/bin -name '*.exe' -o -name '*.dll' -o -name '*.so' | xargs rm
   % find apache-win32/modules -name '*.so' -o -name '*.dll' | xargs rm

9. Clean up any temp files used in the above process; commit and upload a CL.
