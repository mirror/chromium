 * The main feature of this interface is accurate presentation timing
 * feedback to ensure smooth video playback while maintaining audio/video
 * synchronization. Some features use the concept of a presentation clock,
 * which is defined in the presentation.clock_id event.
 *
 * A content update for a wl_surface is submitted by a wl_surface.commit
 * request. Request 'feedback' associates with the wl_surface.commit and
 * provides feedback on the content update, particularly the final realized
 * presentation time.
 *
 * When the final realized presentation time is available, e.g. after a
 * framebuffer flip completes, the requested
 * presentation_feedback.presented events are sent. The final presentation
 * time can differ from the compositor's predicted display update time and
 * the update's target time, especially when the compositor misses its
 * target vertical blanking period.

 * These flags provide information about how the presentation of the

 * the reliability of the feedback and the visual quality with respect to
 * possible tearing and timings. The flags are:
 *
 * VSYNC: The presentation was synchronized to the "vertical retrace" by
 * the display hardware such that tearing does not happen. Relying on user
 * space scheduling is not acceptable for this flag. If presentation is
 * done by a copy to the active frontbuffer, then it must guarantee that
 * tearing cannot happen.
 *
 * HW_CLOCK: The display hardware provided measurements that the hardware
 * driver converted into a presentation timestamp. Sampling a clock in user
 * space is not acceptable for this flag.
 *
 * HW_COMPLETION: The display hardware signalled that it started using the
 * new image content. The opposite of this is e.g. a timer being used to
 * guess when the display hardware has switched to the new image content.
 *
 * ZERO_COPY: The presentation of this update was done zero-copy. This
 * means the buffer from the client was given to display hardware as is,
 * without copying it. Compositing with OpenGL counts as copying, even if
 * textured directly from the client buffer. Possible zero-copy cases
 * include direct scanout of a fullscreen surface and a surface on a
 * hardware overlay.
