/**
 * @page page_pointer_unstable_v1 The pointer_unstable_v1 protocol
 * Protocol for updating cursor of ChromeOS
 *
 * @section page_desc_pointer_unstable_v1 Description
 *
 * This protocol specifies a set of interfaces used to change the state and
 * shape of cursor in ChromeOS.
 *
 * Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
 * incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
 * together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
 * incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
 * and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
 * is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
 * protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is
 * reset.
 *
 * @section page_ifaces_pointer_unstable_v1 Interfaces
 * - @subpage page_iface_zwp_shaped_cursors_v1 - 
 * - @subpage page_iface_zwp_pointer_blending_v1 - blending interface to a wl_pointer
