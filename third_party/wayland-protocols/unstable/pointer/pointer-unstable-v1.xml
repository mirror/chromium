  <description summary="Protocol for updating cursor of ChromeOS">
    This protocol specifies a set of interfaces used to change the state and
    shape of cursor in ChromeOS.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
    incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
    together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
    incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
    and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
    is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
    protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is
    reset.
