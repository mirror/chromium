Description:
TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using
data flow graphs. The graph nodes represent mathematical operations, while the
graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow
between them.  TensorFlow was originally developed or the purposes of
conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research. The system is
general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.

Local Modifications: none
