Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is usually updated by downloading the release tarball
from http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ , removing
files in src, copying *.h *.hh *.cc (except for hb-uniscribe*) from the
tarball's src folder over to src, then checking for removed or added files
and update our build recipes in BUILD.gn and harfbuzz.gyp accordingly, update
the NEWS file from HarfBuzz' release notes, and bump the version numbers
in README.chromium.

Cherry-picked f6799700404c49ae0a for solving an issue with shaper driven run
segmentation caused by compatibility decomposition.
