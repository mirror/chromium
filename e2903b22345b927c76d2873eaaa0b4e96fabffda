It would have a cleaner layer if lines 130-131 where in main(), then no need to pass args.test_result_file and args.rewrite_files to process_file(), making the function more functional.\n\nThe only difference is \u0027artifact_permanent_location\u0027 but I don\u0027t understand why you assign it conditionally.",

      "message": "I changed this to make the function more \"pure\". The function now just process a file, rather than reading, processing, and then sometimes writing out.\n\nAlso, I had thought I wanted to conditionally assign the artifact permanent location, but I don\u0027t think I need to. I think it\u0027s always fine to add that to the json file.",
