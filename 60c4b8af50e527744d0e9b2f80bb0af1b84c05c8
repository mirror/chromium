      "message": "There is no DD, the goal is stated in form of a problem to solve: \"In web rendering service if JS on the page goes nuts and infinite-loops we will get nothing instead of at least some screenshot. We need to force-stop JS after some timeout so we can get control on the renderer and do a best effor to extract at least some info from the page\". Virtual time doesn\u0027t work for that - it fast-forwards when JS is \"sleeping\", not when it\u0027s actually running.\n\nThis change is stage 1 - introduce some tracking and enforcing post-fact quotas. Future stage 2 implies a delayed task on another thread to terminate the isolate if it didn\u0027t return from JS by the deadline.",
