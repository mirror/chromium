In the opener_suppressed case, it\u0027s created and shown here.\n\nIn this change I was going for dropping fullscreen right before the WebContentsDelegate::AddNewContents call, so I did so. Perhaps, since this function is called during popup creation (even though the popup will happen later) I could adjust it so it always was done here.",
