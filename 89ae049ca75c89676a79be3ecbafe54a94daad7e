      "message": "The number of clip rect combinations needed to be cached is roughly proportional to the number of render targets that this clip rect participates in.  Many sites testing locally had only a single root render surface (and one clip rect per node).  Three seemed like a reasonable compromise.  Any overflow of the stack vector goes into a heap, so it should behave similarly to the previous patch.",
