I guess we\u0027re ok with skipping the proxy, if you think it\u0027s just unnecessary work.",

      "message": "I can see the reasoning for this, but I think I found a case where it\u0027s wrong.  :)\n\nWhen going to a new BrowsingInstance, we won\u0027t need any proxies.  But you can go back into an existing BrowsingInstance as well, and then you might.  Repro steps:\n1) Visit http://csreis.github.io/tests/window-open.html\n2) Click \"Open simple window\".  Check that there\u0027s a window.opener in DevTools.\n3) Navigate the second window to chrome://chrome-urls.\n4) Verify it has no window.opener anymore in DevTools.\n5) Run \"w \u003d window.open();\" in the second window, which itself will have a window.opener.\n6) Go back in the second window.  It now has a window.opener again, after the cross-BrowsingInstance navigation.\n\nThus, proxies may be needed in some of these cases.  Maybe we should try to fix the WebUI crashes a different way?\n\n(For some real fun, look what happens when you check the opener of the about:blank popup after going back in step 6.  The opener is kind of half there, being shown as a structured object but of type \"undefined\" instead of \"Window.\")",
