I think it will run when OnNetworkChange() receives the CONNECTION_NONE signal which is sent immediately prior to all online signals, but is meant to trigger \"destructive\" actions like flushing caches and pools and jobs.\"\n\nSo I thought it would be terminated when offline before it goes to for loop.",
