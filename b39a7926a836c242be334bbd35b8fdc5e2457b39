      "message": "I got a feedback from Paul Jenson like this â†“\n\"I don\u0027t think it will run when disconnected; I think that is prevented by the IsOffline() check in GetCurrentAcceptedPriority().  I think it will run when OnNetworkChange() receives the CONNECTION_NONE signal which is sent immediately prior to all online signals, but is meant to trigger \"destructive\" actions like flushing caches and pools and jobs.\"\n\nSo I thought it would be terminated when offline before it goes to for loop.",
