That is a bit much to put into parameters (ten args total).\n\nIt can be reduced to one set of strings by using a property to control the hidden$\u003d, such as hidden$\u003d[[hidePermissionSource_]] that is set inside of permissionSourceString_().\n\nI admit I\u0027m not excited about ten parameters to a function.
