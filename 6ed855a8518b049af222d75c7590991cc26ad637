      "message": "We probably still want to enable assertions in testonly code. Might need to have a separate toggle for assertions vs resources. I\u0027m fine for this to be in a follow-up though. It will be easier to reason about once there\u0027s some resource rewriting code.",

      "message": "Yep that\u0027s the plan - right now build_hooks is enabled for testonly code and assertions are tied to buildhooks.\n\nPlanning to add an _enable_custom_resources flag that is tied to build_hooks_android so that custom resources won\u0027t be enabled for testonly code, and then pass both of these flags to the bytecode rewriter which will determine the ClassVisitors to be used.",
