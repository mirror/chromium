      "message": "A comment on the fade elision CL requested a NOTREACHED in a base class to cover the non-harfbuzz case.  There\u0027s a preexisting method without this protection that we should also fix.  However, there\u0027s no base class, unless we further split this class into a RenderTextTestApi and RenderTextApiHarfbuzz, which creates pain for clients.  I don\u0027t see a way to ask a RenderText instance whether it\u0027s a harfbuzz instance...  that feels like the ideal solution here.  Thoughts?",
