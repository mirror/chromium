      "message": "The MessagePumpFuchsia::Run() method will DoDelayedWork() *before* waiting on events, so if more than 1ms elapses before we reach here then the mx_object_wait_one() will see the I/O event, but not the timed event, I think.\n\nCould we instead have the handler post the delayed task in response to the readable I/O event, so that Run() will see the I/O packet, maybe a USER packet triggered by ScheduleWork (depending on the precise timing), and only then see the timeout?\n\nDoes this test actually fail if you run it without your fix?",
