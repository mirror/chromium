      "message": "nit: it would be nice if the mac-specific logic could be factored out so that we avoid the proliferation of ifdefs that need to be kept in sync.\n\nSpecifically, both this and GpuProcessTransportFactory::EstablishedGpuChannel have similar logic relative to WindowResizeHelperMac::Get()-\u003etask_runner(). It could move to BrowserMainLoop and then the task runner injected to both GpuProcessTransportFactory and this function. WDYT?",

      "message": "RenderWidgetHostImpl::RequestCompositorFrameSink has similar logic and unfortunately would be pretty difficult to inject into. I\u0027m totally pro factoring out the logic to somewhere common, although I wonder if BrowserMainLoop is the right place?\n\nSince the logic isn\u0027t linked to any particular data what do you think about adding a static function somewhere? eg.\n\nscoped_refptr\u003cbase::SequencedTaskRunner\u003e GetCompositorTaskRunner() { ... }",

      "message": "I hate statics, so that\u0027s why I was trying to abstract them away :) E.g. it\u0027s not clear that a static task runner will be necessarily appropriate if we port the Mac logic to Windows (which we ought to to get the same benefits, but no-one is working on that at the moment).\nBrowserMainLoop makes sense because it both creates GPTF and calls  ConnectWithInProcessFrameSinkManager. But I guess it doesn\u0027t work too well for RenderWidgetHostImpl without bigger refactors. What we could do is make it a function on BrowserMainLoop, inject it where we can (GPTF and this), and access it via BrowserMainLoop::GetInstance in the RenderWidgetHostImpl case.",
