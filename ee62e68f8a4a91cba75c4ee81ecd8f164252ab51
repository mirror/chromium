      "message": "nit: it would be nice if the mac-specific logic could be factored out so that we avoid the proliferation of ifdefs that need to be kept in sync.\n\nSpecifically, both this and GpuProcessTransportFactory::EstablishedGpuChannel have similar logic relative to WindowResizeHelperMac::Get()-\u003etask_runner(). It could move to BrowserMainLoop and then the task runner injected to both GpuProcessTransportFactory and this function. WDYT?",

      "message": "RenderWidgetHostImpl::RequestCompositorFrameSink has similar logic and unfortunately would be pretty difficult to inject into. I\u0027m totally pro factoring out the logic to somewhere common, although I wonder if BrowserMainLoop is the right place?\n\nSince the logic isn\u0027t linked to any particular data what do you think about adding a static function somewhere? eg.\n\nscoped_refptr\u003cbase::SequencedTaskRunner\u003e GetCompositorTaskRunner() { ... }",
