      "message": "nit: it would be nice if the mac-specific logic could be factored out so that we avoid the proliferation of ifdefs that need to be kept in sync.\n\nSpecifically, both this and GpuProcessTransportFactory::EstablishedGpuChannel have similar logic relative to WindowResizeHelperMac::Get()-\u003etask_runner(). It could move to BrowserMainLoop and then the task runner injected to both GpuProcessTransportFactory and this function. WDYT?",
