      "message": "I am not sure if this is a good solution, since a disable reason of blocked_by_policy just means that the extension was disabled because it failed a UserMayLoad check (this may be due to reasons other than a simple blacklisting.) And exposing this, won\u0027t really mean much. \n\nAlternative is to just check MustRemainDisabled. Then blocked_by_management_policy would have better \"semantics\".\n\nAnother alternative which I had suggested was to expose a field mayEnable, similar to the mayDisable we have currently.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "Are there reasons that an extension must remain disabled other than by management policy (e.g. UwS blacklist)?\n\nFrom an enterprise perspective what we really care about is whether a user may re-enable an extension. Whether an extension is perma-disabled due to our policy or another mechanism isn\u0027t really important. The mayEnable field sounds like it\u0027d be a good way of conveying this information.",

The extensions blacklisted due to server side checks are not treated as disabled and don\u0027t show up in chrome.management.getAll() as per my understanding. \n\nI also agree that the mayEnable field sounds better. Will wait to here what Devlin has to say.",
