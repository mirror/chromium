      "message": "I am not sure if this is a good solution, since a disable reason of blocked_by_policy just means that the extension was disabled because it failed a UserMayLoad check (this may be due to reasons other than a simple blacklisting.) And exposing this, won\u0027t really mean much. \n\nAlternative is to just check MustRemainDisabled. Then blocked_by_management_policy would have better \"semantics\".\n\nAnother alternative which I had suggested was to expose a field mayEnable, similar to the mayDisable we have currently.\n\nWDYT?",
