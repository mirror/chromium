I like to keep landing small changes.\n\nAlso: should the destination directory be maybe content/child/loader?\n\n(Other loading-related files are generally in content/child, and content/renderer can depend on content/child while the other is not possible, so having these in content/child might be a bit handier. Also I think this is more about loading rather than net.  ...that\u0027s said our final plan is move them further to network service, so where put them now is probably not a big problem)",
