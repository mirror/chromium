It points to some chrome:// util js file that provides a $() implementation to use instead (kinda like we do here!). However, since this is not a WebUI in the strict sense and we can\u0027t include stuff from chrome://, this doesn\u0027t apply. Yay for adding presubmits that fail on existing code.",
