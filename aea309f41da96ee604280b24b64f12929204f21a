Please see latest patchset 6 with the correct diff.\n\nAlso, regarding adding the link in the HTML, I prefer not to do this, because I think it will complicate the code. Given that the error message is already coming as HTML and we plug it in the UI using inner-h-t-m-l binding, see [1]. Trying to avoid having to refactor #updateStatusMessage contents.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/resources/settings/about_page/about_page.html?q\u003dabout_page.html\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr\u0026l\u003d107,109,113.",
