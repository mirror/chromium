      "message": "Good point, and I agree, but I don\u0027t know a good solution - maybe you can suggest one.\n\nHere\u0027s my dilemna:\n\n1) The code in env_chromium.h is much more than a leveldb::Env implementation.\n2) The current namespace, leveldb_env, implies that is for our \"Env\" implementation, and it\u0027s much more than that.\n\nAll of leveldb is in the \"leveldb\" namespace. The ideas, so far, have been:\n\n1) leveldb::chrome\n2) chrome::leveldb\n3) storage::leveldb\n4) leveldb_chrome\n\nThe problems with each idea is:\n\n1) The leveldb project owns that namespace, and we probably shouldn\u0027t extend it.\n2) This code isn\u0027t in //chrome, so we probably shouldn\u0027t be in that namespace.\n3) I believe //storage contains code that all have web facing API\u0027s - leveldb does not.\n4) leveldb_chrome is a compound name really asking for a nested namespace.\n\nSo I feel stuck for a good solution here and welcome any ideas you may have.",
