      "message": "This looked problematic at first glance. But it looks like it\u0027s just a bunch of mojom files. So this is probably OK. But it would be good to follow a more traditional scheme for these (e.g., they should live in public/interfaces/, and so on). That\u0027s a separate issue from what you are working on though. So I wouldn\u0027t block on that, but it would be good to bring that up with components/arc OWNERS.",
