Camille and I iterated on this for a few rounds before converging on base::Optional\u003cbool\u003e. See comments earlier in reviews for details.\n\nFor now I reverted this back to just \u0027bool\u0027. We should be aware that if callers want to handle \u0027unknown\u0027 differently from \u0027false\u0027, we will need to refine the API to support that at that time.",

      "message": "Thanks for outlining your concerns! I\u0027m wondering what is the meaningful difference between \"this is not a download\" vs \"I don\u0027t know\"? The latter case will be only in the case of an error, right? If it is an error, can we conclusively say \"yes, it was supposed to be a download\" or \"no, this wasn\u0027t supposed to be a download\"? If we can, then it will make sense to have base::Optional. I just don\u0027t know how we could distinguish the two cases, so please do share if you know of ways we can classify them.\n\nAlso, if we leave the API as a boolean, then we can give a good description in the public API outlining that false and unknown are currently the same, so whoever calls the API is at least aware of the limitation.",
