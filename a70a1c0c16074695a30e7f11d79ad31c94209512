      "message": "Eventually, enable_vr *should* go away and the files will be included by default, although that\u0027ll be a while. I can go ahead and enable it on Linux Builder and linux_chromium_rel_ng as well if that\u0027s preferred - it should work just fine there. We just didn\u0027t want to enable it on lots of bots since we don\u0027t get any additional test coverage out of it (cjgrant@ says we\u0027re mostly just interested at catching any non-Android issues right now).",

      "message": "I think we need to keep enable_vr disabled for most existing linux builders, as that\u0027s the norm.  With this CL, we simply want to make sure that the linux target also compiles and passes VR tests if enable_vr is set.  I figured that\u0027d be a different (additional) build target, but I don\u0027t know what the preferences are here.",
