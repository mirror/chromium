      "message": "Eventually, enable_vr *should* go away and the files will be included by default, although that\u0027ll be a while. I can go ahead and enable it on Linux Builder and linux_chromium_rel_ng as well if that\u0027s preferred - it should work just fine there. We just didn\u0027t want to enable it on lots of bots since we don\u0027t get any additional test coverage out of it (cjgrant@ says we\u0027re mostly just interested at catching any non-Android issues right now).",
