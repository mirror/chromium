      "message": "You have `explicit_done` above, which is what I would have suggested.\n\nAn alternative is to wrap the `TestUtils...` call below in a `promise_test`. Something like:\n\n```\npromise_test(t \u003d\u003e {\n  return TestUtils.populateStorage()\n    .then(_ \u003d\u003e ...)\n    .then(_ \u003d\u003e ...);\n});\n```",

      "message": "Explicit done only prevents the test suite from finishing after the page is loaded, i.e. before we have a chance to add tests on line 39. However, testharness still complains.\n\nWrapping the whole thing as promise_test would be possible, but then we would have one large test instead of one test for each datatype. I think the latter produces a much nicer result, you see which backends pass and which ones are failing.",
