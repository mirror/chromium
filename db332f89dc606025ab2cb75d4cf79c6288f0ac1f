      "message": "Yeah, I\u0027m not planning on comparing across versions, but instead spot-checking occasionally to see if anything\u0027s failing in an unexpected way. Having a UMA that only works within one version seems fine for that. And I don\u0027t feel like adding (and maintaining) 100 new error codes just for that.",

      "message": "This is not my favourite thing. It\u0027s a histogram that really only one person knows how to use, and is hard to use with our tools. Is this expected to be a long lived histogram, or is this for a short term investigation?\n\nAn alternative would be to hash the log messages and report that. If they are unique to their lines, and don\u0027t change often, it would be an approach that works across versions. You could either not define an enum for it, or generate it from code (prefered).",

      "message": "I\u0027m mainly interested in this as a temporary measure, but it would be nice if it could stick around in case someone else needs it in the future. There have several times when I\u0027ve wondered if some new piece of code is failing in an unexpected way, and there\u0027s no way to get info about that besides adding a bunch of one-time histograms and waiting for them to be released.\n\nWe actually don\u0027t include the log messages in release builds, so I don\u0027t know that there would be a way to hash them. We could add them, but it seems like adding new release LOGs is strongly discouraged, partly for binary size reasons.",
