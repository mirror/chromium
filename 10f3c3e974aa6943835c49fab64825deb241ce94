      "message": "Any particular reason you write one file to disk but send the other via stdin? It\u0027s probably faster than writing both to disk, but is it sufficiently faster to make a noticeable difference? If it isn\u0027t, I would suggest writing both to disk and then getting stdout via a simple \"subprocess.CheckOutput\" instead of separate Popen and communicate calls.\n\nAlternatively, if you were taking this approach for the speedup, consider using https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html to compute diffs in memory without having to write anything out to disk or start any subprocesses.",
