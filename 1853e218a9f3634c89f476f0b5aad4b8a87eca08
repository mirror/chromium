I filed crbug.com/758724 to track this but it is not a problem in practice at the moment because I believe all of the StringPiece objects passed down come from char[] or std::string objects with no substring operations being performed.\n\nThat said, converting from StringPiece to const char* and then back to StringPiece makes no sense, so I\u0027m simplifying that.",
