      "message": "I am not sure if we should do this. SpdySession::GetWeakPtr() is said to be only usable by SpdySessionPool in spdy_session.h. Getting a weak ptr from a raw SpdySession ptr isn\u0027t a good practice and is likely to be abused. You mentioned that this dependency on SpdySession will go away in subsequent CLs, but I am not exactly seeing how that can be done. \n\nCan you outline the steps?",
