      "message": "I worry about a growing error term here in exactly the same cases that would trigger overflow before.\n\nOverflow in the old code requires that the average sample duration is at least 9 minutes (the largest MovingAverage instance holds 32 samples). Maybe we should just clamp the samples to sqrt(int64_t::max / depth_)?\n\nWe could also recompute the sum-of-squares when large samples are discarded, but I think the cutoff for \u0027large\u0027 is relatively small (about 10 million base units, which is easy to hit with microseconds).",

      "message": "Yes, I agree with Dan. Actually the formula \"deviation \u003d square sum - sum square\" is error sensitive (because as you see, it is a difference of two large number). \n\nWhat about changing the unit from Microsecond(1e-6 s) to Millisecond(1e-3 s) [or maybe 1e-4 s if millisecond is 1e-3 s is not enough], but stick to integer type.",
