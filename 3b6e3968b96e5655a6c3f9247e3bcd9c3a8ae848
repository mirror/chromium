      "message": "I worry about a growing error term here in exactly the same cases that would trigger overflow before.\n\nOverflow in the old code requires that the average sample duration is at least 9 minutes (the largest MovingAverage instance holds 32 samples). Maybe we should just clamp the samples to sqrt(int64_t::max / depth_)?\n\nWe could also recompute the sum-of-squares when large samples are discarded, but I think the cutoff for \u0027large\u0027 is relatively small (about 10 million base units, which is easy to hit with microseconds).",
