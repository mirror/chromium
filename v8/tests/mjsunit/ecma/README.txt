This directory contains tests derived from the Mozilla JS test suite.
Whenever a Mozilla test contains code that clearly violates the
ECMA-262 specification, we disable the test. If an invalid test
contains valid assertions, it is advisable to move these (valid) tests
to the corresponding .js files in this directory.
