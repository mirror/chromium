      "message": "it seems somewhat inconsistent; see, for instance, line 314 in this very file which uses braces, then immediately after at line 317 which doesn\u0027t. Perhaps we should have a team-wide discussion about whether the formatter should pick one and apply it to the whole codebase?\n\nAlso I like the braces since you don\u0027t have to add them when you modify the block, so I\u0027ll keep them in this case since it still conforms to the style guide :)",
