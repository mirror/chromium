      "message": "Let\u0027s discuss the pros and cons of splitting |should_block_response_| into two bools. Right now, as the code is structured, |should_block_response_| can transition to true, and then back to false after sniffing.\n\nIf this value were called is_unsafe_based_on_response_headers_ or something, and the transition back to false was instead instead inverted so that it became a false-\u003etrue transition of sniffed_as_safe_ ... would that be more readable",

      "message": "I\u0027m not convinced this size-one buffer complexity is worth its carrying cost. We don\u0027t really need to minimize the memory footprint in this rare case; size-one allocations (or really, a buffer smaller than kMaxBytesToSniff) could turn out to be a pathological case for other resource handlers.\n\nI think it\u0027s better to just proceed with local_buffer_ allocation as with the sniffing case, and bypass the sniffing step in OnReadCompleted.",
