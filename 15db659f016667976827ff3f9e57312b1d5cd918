I haven\u0027t landed many cls using gerrit, so still learning.\n\nIt\u0027s actually OK that mark@ had not responded - I was pondering if my DCHECK() really solved the problem I was targeting (discovering if __target goes away in a future macOS release). Seems like I need a unit test instead (because the color panel code may never get called)?",
