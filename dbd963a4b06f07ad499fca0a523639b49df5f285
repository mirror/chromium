The if condition on the line 410 says that expected_dest_real[i] is not finite. The test here checks that the actual (instead of the expected) dest_real[i] is also not finite.\n\n\u003e Also, would EXPECT_TRUE(!std::isfinite()) be better to indicate what\u0027s happening?\n\nYes, it would as this is the else branch for if(std::isfinite(...)).",
