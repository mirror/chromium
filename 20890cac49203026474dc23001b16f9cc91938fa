      "message": "Thinking about it some more. I wonder if we should just delete these two \"TextfieldReadOnlyColor\" constants. The cookie view sets the background color, and the omnibox sets foreground colors, so there\u0027s exactly 0 textfields in Chrome that use both colors from the \"readonly textfield theme\"\n\nInstead, the fix would be that readonly textfields are identical to non-readonly textfields by default.\n\nSpecs still have the cookie dialog with grey text on cookie properties - it can use STYLE_DISABLED. (or STYLE_SECONDARY - the spec in http://crbug.com/610428 isn\u0027t clear on that).\n\nI will need to merge a fix to M61 to fix comboboxes though - maybe removing these constants completely is too heavy-handed.",
