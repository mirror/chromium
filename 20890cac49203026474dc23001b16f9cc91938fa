      "message": "Thinking about it some more. I wonder if we should just delete these two \"TextfieldReadOnlyColor\" constants. The cookie view sets the background color, and the omnibox sets foreground colors, so there\u0027s exactly 0 textfields in Chrome that use both colors from the \"readonly textfield theme\"\n\nInstead, the fix would be that readonly textfields are identical to non-readonly textfields by default.\n\nSpecs still have the cookie dialog with grey text on cookie properties - it can use STYLE_DISABLED. (or STYLE_SECONDARY - the spec in http://crbug.com/610428 isn\u0027t clear on that).\n\nI will need to merge a fix to M61 to fix comboboxes though - maybe removing these constants completely is too heavy-handed.",

      "message": "\u003e Seems like readonly textfields should look like disabled textfields by default rather than looking like normal ones?\n\nI\u0027m not sure.. disabled textfields tend to have no text in them until they become enabled. (A typical example that comes to mind is a \"Enter your state/province\" which becomes enabled if you\u0027re outside the USA). So it\u0027s hard to compare.\n\nI think the omnibox in popup windows is the clearest use-case we have for readonly. In this use-case, readonly should look the same as non-read-only. It\u0027s just not editable.\n\n\u003e Am I understanding correctly that the thing in the cookies dialog that uses a readonly textfield is each grey label giving the current value of a cookie property?  If no, then what is?  If yes, then why is that a textfield rather than a label?\n\nYou are correct. Making them a textfield makes the text selectable. Except, we now support selectable views::Label via SetSelectable(true). That wasn\u0027t available when the cookies dialog was written. Switching over should be straightforward.\n\n\u003e I am concerned in general about why that should be grey text, and the a11y impact of using a \"disabled\" style there -- \"disabled\" text is not normally mandated to follow contrast rules, so it may be insufficiently readable to all users.  But these questions seem like they maybe don\u0027t need to be answered on this CL.\n\nYup - agree :). STYLE_SECONDARY (or STYLE_HINT) are a better fit. But for convenience STYLE_SECONDARY is black/default unless --secondary-ui-md is set so we don\u0027t make text on dialogs grey prematurely.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Otherwise, I\u0027m all for removing these constants and instead doing something like \"in Textfield itself, READONLY state is drawn like ____ state by default\".",
