      "message": "Thinking about it some more. I wonder if we should just delete these two \"TextfieldReadOnlyColor\" constants. The cookie view sets the background color, and the omnibox sets foreground colors, so there\u0027s exactly 0 textfields in Chrome that use both colors from the \"readonly textfield theme\"\n\nInstead, the fix would be that readonly textfields are identical to non-readonly textfields by default.\n\nSpecs still have the cookie dialog with grey text on cookie properties - it can use STYLE_DISABLED. (or STYLE_SECONDARY - the spec in http://crbug.com/610428 isn\u0027t clear on that).\n\nI will need to merge a fix to M61 to fix comboboxes though - maybe removing these constants completely is too heavy-handed.",

      "message": "Seems like readonly textfields should look like disabled textfields by default rather than looking like normal ones?\n\nAm I understanding correctly that the thing in the cookies dialog that uses a readonly textfield is each grey label giving the current value of a cookie property?  If no, then what is?  If yes, then why is that a textfield rather than a label?\n\nI am concerned in general about why that should be grey text, and the a11y impact of using a \"disabled\" style there -- \"disabled\" text is not normally mandated to follow contrast rules, so it may be insufficiently readable to all users.  But these questions seem like they maybe don\u0027t need to be answered on this CL.\n\nOtherwise, I\u0027m all for removing these constants and instead doing something like \"in Textfield itself, READONLY state is drawn like ____ state by default\".",
