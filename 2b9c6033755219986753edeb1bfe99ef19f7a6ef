For example, such as changing what metrics are logged.\n\nAdditionally, for histograms - old Chrome versions will continue to log the previous names and therefore you shouldn\u0027t just rename the other suffix - since histograms.xml should cover data from all versions. Instead, you can mark it as obsolete. But do so in a different CL.",
