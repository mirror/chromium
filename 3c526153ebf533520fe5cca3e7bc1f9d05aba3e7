      "message": "A very large portion of this public interface will never be used or implemented - it isn\u0027t called by (Raster)CommandBufferStub. It hints that deriving from GLES2Decoder is undesirable long term, and CommandBufferStub should own not a GLES2Decoder, but something more abstract (that both GLES2Decoder and RasterDecoder would implement).\n\nI think this is something we should do sooner rather than later, to avoid having to carry this weight everywhere. Do you think it would be a good idea to do before landing this, or perhaps as a follow-up?",
