      "message": "SG, but it turns out that SetNeedsRedraw alone is not enough, because the Draw will early-out with no damages. I\u0027m also not sure if we really will wait for the tiles if there are any, because tile preparation may only start after the redraw...\n\nWill fix/add tests once we know how to solve this :)",
