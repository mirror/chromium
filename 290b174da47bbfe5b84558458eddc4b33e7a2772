By that I mean:\n. when entering locked-fullscreen disable all commands.\n. make sure any functions that are called during locked-fullscreen in BrowserCommandController to update state early out.\n. when existing reenable the appropriate comments (again, from BrowserCommandController).\n\nDoing that should mean you don\u0027t need to change CommandUpdater at all.",
