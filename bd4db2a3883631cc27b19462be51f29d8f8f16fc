This makes sure that if the destination file already exists, its permissions aren\u0027t changed by this operation.\n\nCan you expand the comment to say that we\u0027re explicitly undoing the COPYFILE_SECURTIY semantics of COPYFILE_CLONE?\n\nAlso, I\u0027m assuming that merely changing inode metadata doesn\u0027t count as a \"modification\" that would trigger the copy-on-write semantics of cloning.
