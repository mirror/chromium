      "message": "I debated between sending 2 booleans or CookieStoreConfig::SessionCookieMode. I thought the former is clearer, so that\u0027s why I went with it. It does mean that this small conversion of the enum to 2 bools is duplicated here from content::CreateCookieStore. I didn\u0027t want to change the latter to use 2 booleans in this cl because it would end up touching more places, but happy to do it in a followup if you think it\u0027s worth it.",
