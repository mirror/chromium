      "message": "We block web content from opening a number of things beyond `chrome` (`chrome-search` and `chrome-native`, for instance: see the set of things that call into `WebSecurityPolicy::RegisterURLSchemeAsDisplayIsolated`). What are the security guarantees you\u0027d like to provide with this check? Does it make sense to reuse that wider list, or is there a specific issue you wish to prevent for `chrome:`? Would it be possible to enumerate the schemes you _do_ wish to open, rather than enumerating those you wish to restrict?\n\n+creis@, who knows more about the display-isolated restrictions than I do, and who might have opinions about y\u0027all\u0027s threat model. :)",
