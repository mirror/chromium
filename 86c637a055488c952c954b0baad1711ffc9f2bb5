      "message": "We block web content from opening a number of things beyond `chrome` (`chrome-search` and `chrome-native`, for instance: see the set of things that call into `WebSecurityPolicy::RegisterURLSchemeAsDisplayIsolated`). What are the security guarantees you\u0027d like to provide with this check? Does it make sense to reuse that wider list, or is there a specific issue you wish to prevent for `chrome:`? Would it be possible to enumerate the schemes you _do_ wish to open, rather than enumerating those you wish to restrict?\n\n+creis@, who knows more about the display-isolated restrictions than I do, and who might have opinions about y\u0027all\u0027s threat model. :)",

      "message": "I\u0027ve been discussing the issue with creis@, the basic check we wanted to add was restricting ARC from opening arbitrary chrome:// URLs given that the main goal of this CL is to add an explicit way to open chrome://settings/multidevice. Beyond that, in terms of tightening the security model of the existing OnOpenUrl interface, I am probably not the right person to take up that conversation since I am not that familiar with the ARC\u003c\u003eChrome IPC mechanisms but sounds like a good idea to pursue in a follow-up.",
