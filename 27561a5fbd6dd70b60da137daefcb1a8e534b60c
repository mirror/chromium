This is conspicuously different from the other bubble icon views (as demonstrated by this entire class being nearly a no-op). Moving the find bar from its current location to underneath the omnibox places it in an uncanny valley.

I see this as fitting the phase 2 portion of the project better.\n\nI\u0027d considered not even creating a subclass of BubbleIconView(). When I looked at it, I concluded that the functionality of BubbleIconView had nearly all of what is needed for the icon display. Only a couple of virtuals needed to be overridden to get that.
