Probably I can filter out the status bubble by classname...  but that\u0027s not an ideal solution at this layer (e.g. for the case it eventually becomes a views::Widget and doesn\u0027t have as much RTTI any more - there is Widget::is_secondary_widget(), but that\u0027s also a bit gross).\n\nOr I could just stop relying on [NSApp windows] in the test. Or try counting the *change* in window count..",
