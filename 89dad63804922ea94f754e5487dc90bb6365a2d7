      "message": "\u003e This should be * not + to allow zero whitespace as well\n\nOof, you\u0027re right. Done.\n\n\u003e Also, the regex parts \u0027^.*\u0027 and \u0027.*$\u0027 should be no-ops\n\nWell, the \"^\" and \"$\" are implied in Java, but not the \".*\"s. Java\u0027s String#matches() applies to the entire string--this differs from some other languages, e.g. JavaScript. I could rely on the implied \"^\" and \"$\", but I think it\u0027s more readable if I\u0027m explicit.\n\n\u003e I guess it needs to include a ; or something.. (with further whitespace-ignoring)\n\nJava supports word boundaries with \"\\b\". So I\u0027ll just put that before \"Domain\", that should do the right thing.",
