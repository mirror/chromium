      "message": "Ah, OK, it is certainly possible to receive multiple network updates within a frame.\n\nA better solution would be to only allow a single active network request.\n\nAn even better solution would be to move the auto-close logic to internet_page.js. This actually makes a bit more sense with some recent refactoring I did: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/775661\n\nIt looks like we are going to want to do something similar for Tether. LEt\u0027s keep the auto close logic out of this CL for now and I will put up a CL that addresses this for both Tether and Arc VPN.",

I was under the impression that Arc VPN was not treated like Shill configured networks and that Source would be None.
