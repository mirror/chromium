      "message": "How many of these tests that are still DISABLED or MAYBE could actually be enabled now?\n\nFor example, the bug for this is closed as a duplicate of a bug that\u0027s been marked fixed for a couple of years.  Can we just re-enable?\n\nSimilar questions apply to all the other tests below.\n\n(If it\u0027s less risky, I\u0027d be OK with landing this patch and then writing a subsequent one that re-enables all the tests to see how bad that is.)",
