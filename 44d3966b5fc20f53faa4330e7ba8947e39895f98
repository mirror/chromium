From talking with others in the past they said it was desirable to have all component related tests in a single test target (we have followed this pattern in the services directory too).",

      "message": "1. It becomes really difficult to run changes against just the viz specific tests when they are lumped together with everything else in component_unittests. We\u0027d have to adopt some common prefix name, which as far as I know, isn\u0027t done in other test targets.\n2. Most of cc will move under the viz umbrella so viz_unittests will (eventually) replace cc_unittests.\n3. The viz_unittests TestSuite will require custom initialization (similar to cc_unittests now) that isn\u0027t appropriate for components_unittests TestSuite.\n\nObviously viz_unittests is still pretty small now but that should change quickly.",
