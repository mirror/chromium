      "message": "I assume this is the source of the size regression? I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s important for these to be constexpr; it seems like the main usage of constexpr would be to define constexpr TimeDelta / TimeTicks / Time constants, and not to go from a TimeDelta value to the value in nanoseconds. So maybe we should just leave these as non-constexpr?",

      "message": "I\u0027m curious as to why this would lead to a size increase. Perhaps, for non-const cases, the compiler is more-aggressively inlining the code when constexpr is present? If that\u0027s the case, perhaps these should be moved to time.cc? And then, I wonder what the size diff is between the regular and constexpr variants?",
