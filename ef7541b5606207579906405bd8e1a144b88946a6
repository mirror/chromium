I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s important for these to be constexpr; it seems like the main usage of constexpr would be to define constexpr TimeDelta / TimeTicks / Time constants, and not to go from a TimeDelta value to the value in nanoseconds. So maybe we should just leave these as non-constexpr?",
