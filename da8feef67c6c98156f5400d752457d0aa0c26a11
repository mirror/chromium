      "message": "It\u0027s a good thing to note. I should have mentioned it. My thinking in going with it is that these are the MD icons, one would hope that they are designed to work together.\n\nI\u0027m not sure internationally, whether others would see this as a lower case i or an inverted exclamation mark.\n\nWe could use the \u0027help\u0027 icon https://icons.googleplex.com/#search\u003dhelp instead, but I\u0027m concerned that may create confusion with using the help icon as, well, a help icon. Help icons can normally (in my experience) be clicked on to get more help. \n\nI\u0027ll make a separate follow-up bug assigned to bettes@ for guidance. I\u0027ll continue to land this CL as-is since it\u0027s still a step forward and the object of this CL is to replace the png with svg - switching the svg later would be a minor change.",
