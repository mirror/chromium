      "message": "Remind me why we need this list? Can\u0027t we just have ShellSurfaceWidget::OnKeyEvent process all key events now that we have the key ack mechanism that can prevent this from being called until the client had a chance to ack the key event? If anything, if some key bindings are reserved, shouldn\u0027t we handle that in pre-target handler in keyboard.cc? \n\nI think letting ShellSurfaceWidget::OnKeyEvent process all events would also solve the current bug where standard chrome key bindings are not working for simple wayland test clients that are not creating a keyboard instance.",
