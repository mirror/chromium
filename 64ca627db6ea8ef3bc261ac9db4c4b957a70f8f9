I think it makes sense to start smaller and ramp up as aggressively as we can.\n\nI don\u0027t have a strong opinion on where to start.  Are changes in ios/chrome more likely to break EG tests than changes in ios/web, or vice-versa?  I\u0027d guess that there are fewer daily changes in ios/web, if that matters.",
