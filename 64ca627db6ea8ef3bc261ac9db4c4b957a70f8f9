      "message": "My understand is that\u0027s where we want to end up, but we\u0027re ramping it up slowly because we\u0027re worried about overloading the CQ bots.  I think it makes sense to start smaller and ramp up as aggressively as we can.\n\nI don\u0027t have a strong opinion on where to start.  Are changes in ios/chrome more likely to break EG tests than changes in ios/web, or vice-versa?  I\u0027d guess that there are fewer daily changes in ios/web, if that matters.",

It may not be that worse to run on //ios than //ios/chrome,  although there might be a traffic jam during busy hours.\n\nI\u0027ll move it to //ios then and try to allocate more machines.",
