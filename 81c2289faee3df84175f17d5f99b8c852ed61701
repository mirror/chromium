On the one hand, putting the \"pick a file\" logic in URLFetcher for the temporary file case and leaving SimpleURLLoader to simply take a file path and download to it feels like the best separation of responsibilities to me.  On the other hand, that either disallows use of unix \"create, error if file exists\" semantics to handle collisions, or it requires SimpleURLLoader to not error if the file already exists (if the URLFetcher creates an empty file using error-if-file-exists to handle the collision case).  On the third hand, I have a feeling that error-if-file-exists is not a very common or reliable way to handle file name collisions.  Thus the mixed feelings.  \n\nI\u0027ll boil that down to: If you don\u0027t intend to handle collisions at file creation in satisfying the URLFetcher temp file functionality, I\u0027d gently pull towards a boolean here and shoving all the temp file logic into URLFetcher.

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure what you mean by \"shoving all the temp file logic into URLFetcher\" - URLFetcher will no longer exist.\n\nNote that base::CreateTemporaryFile uses various methods to try and ensure success (On windows, has a loop, on POSIX, uses a system API), and creates an empty file, hopefully preventing any conflict.  It also needs to be done off the main thread, so it\u0027s just convenient to have a method on SimpleURLLoader that uses it.\n\nThere are only 3 consumers of URLFetcher::SaveResponseToTemporaryFile, but that\u0027s still 3 consumers that potentially have to all do the exact same thing: Jump over to another thread, create a temp file, jump back, start the SimpleURLLoader with the temporary file path...And if the parent class is destroyed before that happens, they\u0027d ideally delete the temporary file, too.  If we bake it into SimpleURLLoader, we avoid all that - it\u0027s like 10-20 extra lines of code on top of this CL to get all that working.",

But the rest of your response means that collisions in the temporary file case are handled (attempted to be handled? :-}) at a fairly low level, so the temporary file distinction needs to go down pretty far.
