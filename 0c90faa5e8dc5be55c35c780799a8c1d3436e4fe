I\u0027m concerned that if this is a call to clean-up what is already in memory without someone calling the ctor, then it\u0027s probably somewhere in the realm of undefined behavior? I don\u0027t know off the top of my head.\n\nAlso, I\u0027m guessing this can\u0027t be \"DestroyThis\" because we don\u0027t actually have the type set yet?\n\nMaybe AnnotateOp* op \u003d reinterpret_cast ... on 618 is meant to be \n\nAnnotateOp* op \u003d new (output) AnnotateOp;?",
