      "message": "There was a mistake in patch 3 - pending entry doesn\u0027t have the right override flag (always false, and the entry can be null) that we can pass to NR:CreateRendererInitiated. I thought it makes sense to get the flag from the last committed entry since that\u0027s the entry of the page the setting was requested for. Are you suggesting further changes be made so that the pending entry will have the right flag to copy from?  And also, I\u0027m not sure what to do if the entry is null - should we get that of the main frame instead?",

      "message": "No I\u0027m saying it\u0027s ok probably to get the flag from the last committed entry, but the NavigationEntry you pass to NR:CreateRendererInitiated _must_ be the pending NavigationEntry. This is why I asked you to make the UA override flag a parameter to NR::CreateRendererInitiated - so that it can be computed form a different NavigationEntry than the one we pass to the function.",
