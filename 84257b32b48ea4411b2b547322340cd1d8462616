      "message": "This looks wrong (previous code was too).\nDoScissor adjusts based on the decoder state for FBO binding, however here the GL state doesn\u0027t correspond to the decoder state, since we just bound a local FBO to clear a texture level. E.g. if the decoder is offscreen and no FBO is bound from the client\u0027s POV, we shouldn\u0027t adjust y here (and certainly not relative to the offscreen back buffer size).\n\nWe also don\u0027t want to change the decoder state (which DoScissor would).",
