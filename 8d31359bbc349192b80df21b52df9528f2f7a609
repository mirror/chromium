Is that the match_text?  (Answer: no, not the way you use.)\n\u003e Changed this to clarify that it\u0027s the match URL.\nBut it\u0027s not the URL.  Sometimes it\u0027s a query!  Please revise, perhaps \"descriptive_text\" or something\n\n\u003e I would like to also incorporate the match text, but the spoken description shouldn\u0027t be *too* long and I think the URL is more important.",
