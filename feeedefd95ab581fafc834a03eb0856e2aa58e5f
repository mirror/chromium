      "message": "mentioned offline, but I think it would be better to have this cancelAllDialogs live outside of the presenter and have the presenter focused solely on a single dialog.\n\nPresenter manages one, Manager manages the queue, and some outside TabModalDialogLifetimeHandler (or some better name) would contain this logic for when to dismiss any tab modal dialogs.\n\nThe manager would pass a onDismiss callback when calling show on the presenter that would essentially popup another dialog off the queue.",

I think we want the modaldialog package to remain very generic and have implementations live with their most closely related code.  I worry that this would become a fan out of modal dialogs underneath this package and would be hard to maintain.",
