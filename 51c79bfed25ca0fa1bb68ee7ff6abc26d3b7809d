I\u0027m also not clear on why certain values are checked and why some are considered good, since the video shows up properly (visually) when I open the page locally and other platforms, which may be able to show these videos properly, are marked as failing in this file, so I\u0027m wondering if the test is correct or if it is too susceptible to minor differences between platforms.",

      "message": "My plan is not to disable these and never fix them. I just want to be able to disable these in order to land this large change, which affects thousands of tests, but disabling these 4 temporarily, unless someone is willing to help me debug these quickly. As layout tests get modified rather frequently, my window of opportunity to land this is generally rather small. I already notified watk@ and plan to work with him next week to solve these.",
