      "message": "Good to know!  I was going back and forth on this, but figured that allocation cost of a TryCatch was going to be very similar to the Reset() cost, and thought this was clearer than needing to Reset() in certain circumstances.  But I didn\u0027t know there was any additional cost associated with setting it up.  Hoisted to outside the loop.  Thanks!",

      "message": "Not sure how I feel about this. It seems like it\u0027s hacking around the fact that we don\u0027t provide an API to run C++ code when suspension ends. We\u0027re constructing JS data but not really for use by script.\n\nI wonder if what we would rather have is something like:\n\n  // WebLocalFrame\n  virtual void InvokeWhenNotPaused(base::OnceClosure closure);\n\n(where OnceClosure might be replaced by a virtual interface depending on where we are on the discussion about allowing base::Callback in the Blink public API; that\u0027s an ongoing area of development)\n\nThen you could bind the stuff you want in the usual way, rather than having to build a V8 object, stash some data in EventEmitter, etc.",

      "message": "When I previously raised this, there was some hesitation to expose that type of API on WebLocalFrame (though admittedly, we *are* just hacking around that here).  That would certainly be preferable, though.\n\nHow would you feel about going with this approach for now, and I\u0027ll write up a CL to introduce a method on WebLocalFrame to do that separately, and we can continue the discussion there?  If you\u0027re vehemently against this, I understand, and we can explore that first (rather than landing this and then updating if a InvokeWhenNotPaused() is added).",
