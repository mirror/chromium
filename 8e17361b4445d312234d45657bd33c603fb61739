Maybe I can force it for testing?\n\nAnyway, if I could, I would check that the two messages increment the child sequence number.\n\n\nAlso, I couldn\u0027t find the WebView unit test we talked about on our conference call. The closest I found was this? https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/views/controls/webview/webview_unittest.cc?type\u003dcs\u0026q\u003dwebview+_unittest.cc\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d34",
