      "message": "It looks ok according to the style guide?\nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Aliases\nI think this is a public interface.\n\nOr an alternative is extracting the struct from CryptohomeClient into a dedicated header file.\nThough, I wonder where to put. Maybe chromeos/dbus/tpm_token_info.{h,cc} ?\n\nchromeos/tpm/tpm_token_info.{h,cc} looks slightly nicer.\nHowever it looks chromeos/dbus does not depend on chromeos/tpm now, though chromeos/tpm depends on chromeos/dbus, so, putting it in chromeos/tpm introduces a circular deps based on directory.\n\nWDYT?",
