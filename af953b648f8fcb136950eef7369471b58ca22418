That doesn\u0027t seem right; I think they should be one of the IN_PROGRESS statuses.  Now, the equivalent of calling Flush with  waiting_for_service_worker \u003d\u003d true is calling Resolve with NON_PWA, which means that the IN_PROGRESS_NON_PROGRESSIVE_WEB_APP will be used, which I think is correct.\n\nPlease review carefully.",
