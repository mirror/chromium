      "message": "I can\u0027t decide whether it\u0027s better to use the default argument for these or not. To minimise churn for the more heavily used methods, the plan is to leave code under c/b/ui/views unmodified where possible. Then (per the comment in ui/gfx/text_constants.h) just flip the value of gfx::Typesetter::DEFAULT to HARFBUZZ instead. (then delete the Cocoa code)\n\nFor these, I guess it\u0027s nice knowing there are other users of gfx::ElideFilename..",

Here, it really doesn\u0027t matter, since the download shelf is staying Cocoa in m65 (i.e. download_item_view.cc isn\u0027t linked in yet on Mac releases). It just means http://crbug.com/697407 won\u0027t be fixed until that flip happens, but that\u0027s only an issue for mac_views_browser. Still.. I want to try to get it flipped to HARFBUZZ for m65 - it just can\u0027t start that way without regressing the Cocoa browser UI.\n\n(That is, DEFAULT just needs to be PLATFORM while there are still callers of these being used for Cocoa code - which is hopefully not much!).",
