      "message": "Right, I was wondering if transition-delay had any effect, since I\u0027ve only ever seen it being used along with a transition. Trying this locally (https://jsfiddle.net/b03oL8jm/), I see that it still has an effect even without transition.\n\nHaving said that, do we need to do anything about opacity at all? By looking at the demos [1], it seems that a fade-out transition is baked into the spinner itself, as well as a spinner with no [active] attribute has zero opacity anyway.\n\n[1] https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/paper-spinner/demo/demo/index.html\n[2] https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-spinner/blob/master/paper-spinner-styles.html#L77",
