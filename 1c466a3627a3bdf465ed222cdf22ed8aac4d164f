As a strawman proposal, I think:\n\n- Test interfaces should be clearly marked as such\n- Should live in separate interface files ideally (so we can enforce testonly\u003d1)\n- Should only be installed in tests.\n\nDoes this sound reasonable?\n\nThe other factor to consider here is this is an interface exposed by the renderer so maybe we can be more lax?
