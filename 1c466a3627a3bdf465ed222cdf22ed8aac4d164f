That is the only case where the mojo code is defined.  It\u0027s IDL might be complied into declarations though, regardless of the build flag, and there maybe security issues there, not sure.  Anyho ...\n\n\u003e I see two possibilities here:\n\u003e - add conditional compilation to mojom: this was previously discussed in https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-mojo/BfvXCPBpcUs/j93c3TU_DAAJ, and the plan was to add it, but it was never actually implemented\n\nAnd no one working on it either.\n\n\u003e - split the interface file\n\u003e \n\u003e Either one is acceptable; I suspect splitting the interface will be simpler in the short-term.\n\nI gone with the split.  Moved the panel mojo .idl into its own file, updated the BUILD.gn to conditionally compile it.\n\n\u003e (This goes along with my comment that the Blink bits should be guarded by BUILDFLAG as well)",
