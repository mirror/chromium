      "message": "Since \"gerrit:current_user\" is not working like \"gerrit:change_owner\" (for now), we don\u0027t know who is accessing a change in prolog rules.\n\nThus, the rules are defining how a change could be submittable rather than who can submit it. Anyone with \u0027Submit\u0027 permission can submit a change once it\u0027s submittable no matter who creates it.\n\nIn v1, a change will be submittable:\n\n1- If it\u0027s created by FindIt, it\u0027s \u0027on-master\u0027 and \u0027pure-revert\u0027.\n2- If it\u0027s not created by FindIt, it has \u0027Code-Review +1\u0027.\n\n\nThe rules LGTM. But I think the commit message needs to be adjusted. \n\nBy the way, how do you think if a change is created by FindIt but someone else pushes a new patch set to it? The change can still meet condition 1-.",

E.g. The change is still a pure revert if the new PS just rebases it. But I think this is intended.",
