      "message": "Please file a bug to remove this method, mentioning my CL that removed it, and reference the bug here. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/761409\n\nWe really should not need to do this. We should not have to inject pref services from code in //chrome into //ash. Fixing the problem may require rewriting parts of AccessibilityManagerTest, specifically those that deal with prefs being copied from the login screen profile to the active session.\n\nI\u0027m a little sad, since it took a surprisingly large amount of work to get rid of this method in my CL, but I\u0027d rather you land this CL than do more work fixing tests.",
