I believe we should never update if the user has seen the end of the list (unless the list is empty). \n\nMaybe my mental model of the UX constraint is wrong: maybe we can always _append_ if the list is shorter than it should be? Then we could keep another bit (mHasRemoved) that makes this function return true above this if clause.",

Adding items to a list is included in that, even if the list was shorter than we would have liked.\nIf the last suggestion got removed then I\u0027d expect that it has been seen, so the user saw everything at some point. And if not, the new penultimate suggestion is now the last one and the user saw everything.\nMaybe we could use whether the user saw PAST the last suggestion (more item or footer?) to determine when we should not add, but that distinction mattering would be a rare enough occurrence so I wouldn\u0027t want to make changes just for that.",
