So the most we need to do is to read it once, and that\u0027s what this code does.\n\n\u003e For example, in addition to dropping the static variables above, it should let you drop the initialize_timer function.\n\nThe initialize_timer() is superfluous, it\u0027s really not needed.  The code has one goal: return the time _nearest_ to the thing you\u0027re measuring.\n\n   auto start_time \u003d current_time_in_seconds();\n   do_some_stuff();\n   auto elapsed_time \u003d current_time_in_seconds() - start_time;\n\nIn the common case the frequency is known, and the goal is meet.\n\nIf the frequency is not known, then init it (once only), and then return the time nearest the the thing you are measuring (meets the goal).\n\nErgo, the initialize_timer() thing is entirely superfluous: this code self-initializes, and still satisfies its goal.

Some readers don\u0027t grok that\"\n\nWell, that\u0027s kind of my point. Even if the system frequency is set once when WIN_OS boots, the code might be easier for others to follow if you just call QueryPerformanceFrequency every time. It\u0027s not like you call current_time_in_seconds in the inner-most loops.",
