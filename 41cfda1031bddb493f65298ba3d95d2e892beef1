      "message": "Historically we have several developers working on Xcode betas before we move the rest of the team.  We will have a state where Xcode 9 is required and Xcode 10 works (and is being developed with).  The second assert will prevent this.  What we change this to when that happens?",

      "message": "We don\u0027t even know if Xcode will use the same version numbering when moving past Xcode 9, so I recommend not adding this second assertion.\n\nAdditionally, it looks like what is not supported is building with iOS 10 SDK, so instead this assertion should check the version of the SDK, not the version of Xcode (i.e. should assert if someone tries to build with Xcode 9 and iOS 10 SDK).\n\nThis will require adding another variable \"ios_sdk_version_int\" in the script too.",

      "message": "Justin\u003e\nYeah, I\u0027m aware of this :-(\n\nHere\u0027s what I would like for it to happen:\nAs soon as developers start working with the beta, they\u0027d change the second assert.\nThat change would serve as a reminder that once everybody migrates to the new xcode (~2 months later) the 1st assert would need to be fixed.\nI realize it\u0027s far from ideal, but I don\u0027t see any other option.\n\nI guess I\u0027ll remove the 2nd assert.\n\nSylvain\u003e\nAck\nAs Justin said that SDK and Xcode versions are linked, I\u0027ll keep using xcode_version_int because it\u0027s less work for me.",
