      "message": "This function is making me sad.\n\nThe tab gets the icon via the OnAudioStateChanged. We already have a delegate call OnAudioStateChanged, and now we\u0027re getting a WebContentsObserver call DidUpdateAudioState.\n\nFirst, can we make the name the same between the delegate and the observer. Second, can we simplify this? Have one path for the tab, the omnibox, and the users of the delegate?",

      "message": "I understand your concerns, but DidUpdateAudioState more closely follows the naming of methods in WebContentsObserver, so I hesitate to change the name there. Regarding the delegate and tab paths, I don\u0027t really know enough about them to make a call as to whether they can be easily combined into a single path. Is there someone I can talk to who has insights into those codepaths?",
