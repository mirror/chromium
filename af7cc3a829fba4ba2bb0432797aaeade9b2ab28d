      "message": "I ended up reworking the design a bit to make it easier to understand.\n\nThe constructor of ServiceVideoCaptureDeviceLauncher now receives a single Callback object and no |device_factory|. It obtains a |device_factory| on-demand by invoking the callback. That automatically triggers the connection request to the service. The destructor of |device_factory| automatically messages VideoCaptureProvider that the connection is no longer needed.",
