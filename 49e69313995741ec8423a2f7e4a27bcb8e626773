      "message": "It\u0027s a good question. The answer is that yes, this patch will change behaviour (but not in the sense you think).\n\nThe biggest change here is that all tasks here become pausable during things like javascript alert dialogs. That wasn\u0027t the case (due to naming confusion, for UnthrottledButBlockable), but this should definitely be fixed.\n\nThe second question is what should we do with deferrable (used to be called \"blockable\") tasks. I believe that we should stick to the same principle â€” everything goes into \"deferrable\" queue except things that went to unthrottled queue.",

      "message": "The problem was that the tasks from this queue were executed during print window when the execution context was paused. This let to us checking for this and dropping the callback.\n\nSo we moved this task type to SuspendableTaskRunner to ensure that this task is paused during dialogs. Now all tasks are paused during dialogs :).\n\nThere is a separate question why this task type doesn\u0027t go to PausableTaskQueue now, and I believe that the answer is the same as for the rest of the tasks: we don\u0027t have evidence that it shouldn\u0027t be in the deferrable task queue.",
