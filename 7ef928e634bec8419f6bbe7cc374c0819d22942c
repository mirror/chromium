      "message": "For the extension name to result in an empty string after collapsing, IIUC the name would have had to look like it was empty to begin with, e.g. \"                 \". In any case, it looks like Chrome accepts empty extension names. I tried this just now with an unpacked extension. \n\nWe might want to consider setting a default name, e.g. \"Untitled\", if the extension name is empty.
