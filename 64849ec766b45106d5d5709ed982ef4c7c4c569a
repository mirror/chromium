      "message": "I also feel \"Expand\"/\"Collapse\" is more natural, but then this CL will not be merged to M61 as it adds new UI string. Currently, screen reader says \"image\" on top of the expand button, so I thought it\u0027s still better than nothing.\nFrom chrome://settings examples, it seems the most appropriate candidate is something like \"Expand notification\" / \"Show notification detail\" rather than just \"Expand\".\n\nLet\u0027s postpone this at least until the M61 schedule issue is resolved.",
