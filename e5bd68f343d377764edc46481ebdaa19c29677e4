      "message": "I think BindInterfaceInGpuProcess is meant to be called from the IO thread (since it calls GpuProcessHost::Get()).\n\nSo maybe we can skip the hop to the client thread for FinishInitialization:\n\nInitialize (client thread)\n-\u003e RequestGPUInfoOnIOThread  (posted task on IO thread)\n-\u003e DidReceiveGPUInfoOnIOThread (callback on IO thread)\n-\u003e FinishInitialization (called directly on IO thread, or folded into DidReceiveGPUInfoOnIOThread)\n-\u003e media::JpegDecodeAccelerator::InitializeDecoder (called directly on IO thread)\n-\u003e OnInitializationDone (posted on client thread)\n\nThat even simplifies things a bit, because then GpuJpegDecodeAcceleratorHost is created on the IO thread (which means you don\u0027t need to explicitly pass the task runner, and in fact you can just use a SequenceChecker there)",
