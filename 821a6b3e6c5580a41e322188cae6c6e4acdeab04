      "message": "It looks there are a lot of pattern in this CL as such:\n\n- A function name mentions only *V1*.\n- However, the actual implementation is using the condition of root-\u003eIsV1() || root-\u003eIsUserAgentV1())\n\nThey sound inconsistent, and things are getting difficult to remember.\n\nI\u0027m afraid that we would have to look at not only the function name, but also the contents of the function to know what condition is actually used, unless there is consistent and easy-to-remember naming rules. We can\u0027t trust the function name anymore.\n\nCould you try to think about consistent naming rules (or policy)?\nThe current naming rule looks inconsistent everywhere.",
