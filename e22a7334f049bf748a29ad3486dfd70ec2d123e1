Accerciser could show some information, and maybe orca in the future, but it seems right now there is no use of this.\n\nIt would be more interesting to add get_localized_name (which we provide), but I am right now trying to mimic the existing behavior in BrowserAccessibilityAuraLinux without adding much functionality yet. So that would come later.",
