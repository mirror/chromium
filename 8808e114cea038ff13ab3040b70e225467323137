      "message": "mWindowAndroid.getContext() is a weak reference - you mustn\u0027t just use the result of get() without checking it for null.\n\nProbably you want to use mContext here instead? It seems like mContext should have been initialised at the point this is called, and is a regular reference. Not super familiar with this code though.",

      "message": "isDeviceProvisioned() checks null inside, and if context is null, isDeviceProvisioned will return true.\n\nI think there is no too much difference for mWindowAndroid.getContext() and mContext in WebView? AFAIK getContext() will be changed during reparenting in Chrome though.\n\nI want to utilize this to get ride of mocking ContentResolver and then set the right DEVICE_PROVISIONED flag inside ContentResolver for the test. See the new patch to fix the tests.",
