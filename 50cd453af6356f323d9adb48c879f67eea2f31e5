      "message": "You mean in cryptohome_client? \n\nIt\u0027s not clear to me why the client has this proto in the signature if it\u0027s always unauthenticated; is it for uniformity between methods? Note that even the comment on the method here: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chromeos/dbus/cryptohome_client.h?dr\u003dC\u0026l\u003d495 says that it\u0027s never required.\n\nFor now my only goal is to make this layer pass-through, I think we can circle back to deleting AuthorizationRequest from the client interface. WDYT?",
