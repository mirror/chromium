      "message": "The comment I wrote in https://codereview.chromium.org/2786523003/diff/340001/content/browser/frame_host/navigation_controller_impl.cc was mixing and matching descriptions from multiple issues, and I think ended up being inaccurate.\n\nThe primary purpose of this block is to handle the problem of window.open(\"about:blank\") leaving about:blank in the b/f list. The FrameLoader.cpp changes would leave about:blank in the b/f list for window.open(\"\") as well. I think cases involving iframes might Just Work, because those route through blink\u0027s defenses against leaving about:blank at the front of the b/f list.\n\nI\u0027m happy to drop this (standardizing our behavior on leaving about:blank in the b/f list), or try to get this block exactly right. But given our previous discussions about how it would be nice to standardize on FF and IE/Edge behavior, I think this is preferable.",
