      "message": "Here I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m doing enough testing. I do test every method of U2fBleDevice\u0027s public interface, but the class does quite a bit of non-trivial logic and also inherits public methods from U2fDevice, which I am not testing here.\n\nAlso I suppose doing some integration testing with the Mock Bluetooth classes would be a good idea as well, but that would require quite some refactoring of the U2fBleTransaction tests.\n\nWhat is your take on this?",

      "message": "I\u0027m a bit torn about this. In theory this class could live in an anonymous namespace in u2f_ble_device.cc, as U2fBleDevice should be the only class using this. However, I feel like the class is a bit too large for being in the anon namespace, which is why I decided to move it into its own file. But I must admit I\u0027m not very happy about this either. WDYT?",
