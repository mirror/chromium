Thus, stylus rejected doesn\u0027t turn screen on for user-inactivity screen off.\n\nAnd I agree with Dan, PowerButton* code doesn\u0027t look like a good host for note-taking impl.",

      "message": "yeah, I didn\u0027t find adding this logic to PowerButton* class ideal either - the reason was that this is where setting screen state due to stylus ejection was done.\n\nThough, the main connection of this class to power button is that it\u0027s owned by power button classes (there doesn\u0027t seem to be anything power button specific in the class logic itself) - it seems like it could be easily generalized into display_power_controller that can be used by both power button and lock screen apps code (and maybe its ownership can be moved to ash/shell.h). Let me look into doing this.",

      "message": "sorry, but i don\u0027t think that renaming PowerButtonDisplayController is the right approach here either. this is a helper class used by the power button classes; they use it to force the display off, and it handles turning the display back on in response to various events.\n\nDisplayPowerController isn\u0027t an appropriate name for it since there\u0027s other unrelated code related to displays\u0027 power states (see e.g. https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/display/manager/chromeos/display_configurator.h?q\u003dSetDisplayPower\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d229). please keep the current name for this class.\n\nwhy can\u0027t a lock-screen-note-taking-specific class observe stylus eject events directly and handle launching the app itself? is the problem that you need additional information about the display state to determine whether you should launch the app? if you explain more about what you need, we can try to figure out a cleaner way of getting the information to the right place.\n\n(feel free to move this discussion to the bug, which seems like it might be a better place to nail down the design of this.)",
