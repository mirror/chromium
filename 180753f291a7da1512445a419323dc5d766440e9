      "message": "This will close the temporary file, but not delete it; preferably we should also unlink() it here, rather than relying on OS /tmp sweeping to clean it up.\n\nAlso, you\u0027re relying on the ability to re-open() an already-open temporary file, which isn\u0027t supported, in general, on all platforms. In practice it will work under Windows and Linux, but perhaps we should just close(), getresults, unlink() for consistency?",

      "message": "tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() returns a file-like object that deletes the file at the end. Actually this close() call is not necessary either. Removed it. Python calls __del__() for the object before the object is garbage-collected when returning from RunFuchsia(), which deletes the file as well.\n\nI don\u0027t think there can be problems re-opening the file. The code above calls NamedTemporaryFile(), and I think that API is designed for this case and should work correctly.",
