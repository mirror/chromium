      "message": "Ok, figured it out. To send utf-8-converted output to clang, I tell clang to read from stdin (\u0027-\u0027) instead of from the original file. But the file\u0027s directory is on the directory search path, so I need to pass -Idirname(input). My bug was that I added this -I flag after all the other -I flags, so the `#include \"resource.h\"` in chrome/installer/gcapi/gcapi_test.rc then picked up third_party/icu/source/common\\\\resource.h instead of c/i/gcapi/resource.h, which confused everyone. Fixed. While here, also prefixed the last two error messages emitted by rc.py with \"rc.py:\" and changed tool_wrapper.py to not pass shell\u003dTrue for rc.py on Windows -- it doesn\u0027t seem necessary for anything.",
