      "message": "I don\u0027t understand this one.... Is this about moving the \u0027high priority\u0027 into MainThreadTaskQueue::QueueCreationParams? That is, add an \"is important\" bool to the creation params, rather than creating the queue and setting it afterwards?\n\nOr do want a different/finer grained control of when to issue high priority tasks? In this case, I\u0027m not sure how.\n\n---\n\nThere was a good bit of discussion around this in email \u0026 previous rounds of the CL. For the tasks I want to prioritize (very short run-time, but important to trigger other work), I\u0027m quite sure I want the high priority. I was initially a bit sloppy about that and had other tasks in there, too, but after feedback this has been separated out quite cleanly, IMHO, and the tasks that go into the \u0027loading control\u0027 queue really are control tasks that should be executed ahead of other loading tasks.\n\nThere was some discussion about some asserting that the \"control\" tasks are really very short duration tasks, but I wouldn\u0027t be sure how to do this.\n\nIf it helps, the whole feature is behind a feature flag, so we can do experiments before launching.",
