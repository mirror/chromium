      "message": "Invalidate what when what is pending?\nI think I know what you mean, but it took me a good 5 minutes to figure out.\n\nFirst of all: You can\u0027t get here when there is read_op pending, the calling thread is not allowed to call Read() until the previous read is done.\nBecause of that, there is currently no way to call SeekTask_Locked with no pending seek positions.\n\nHowever, it\u0027s possible for there to be a pending read_op_ when SeekTask_Locked is called, in which case it\u0027s probably better to just defer the seeks until the read_op_ finishes.\n(Basically, seeks are bad, so we\u0027ll be as lazy as possible about actually doing them.)\n\nWill try this last part tomorrow.",
