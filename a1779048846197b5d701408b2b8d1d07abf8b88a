      "message": "The UMA part of it adds the counts to the uma counter, which I think is aggregated at some point, but it is presented as a histogram, so each count is there. You\u0027re right that the UKM portion of this aggregates over a second and sends one sample as second (with 4 entries one for each type). This prevents us from spamming up to 240 times a second (60/second * 4 entries). We do lose the granularity of each entry, but we at least have a per url per second measure, which I think is still very useful.",
