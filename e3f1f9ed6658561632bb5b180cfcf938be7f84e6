That would explain why MaximumTilingContentsScale doesn\u0027t return anything meaningful here.  That makes sense.\n\nWhat about using GetIdealContentsScale() here, which includes device scale, page scale, and layer transform?  Mostly I just want to use something more than just device scale that includes the other scale factors that may be affecting a layer.",
