While, in principle, one could create a rule to set the command line the python test runner needs to know which classes or methods use this, and I can\u0027t think of a way of doing this without annotations on the classes. dgn@ (who did some of the original work on CommandLineFlags) tells me that this has been raised as an issue with using Junit4, but there is, at least to date, no solution forthcoming.\n\n\nSimilar arguments apply to the @Restriction annotation.",

      "message": "Not obvious that it can be reduced significantly. Unfortunately the current ChomeActivityRule, and hence rules derived from it, require the activity to be explicitly started, although Android\u0027s underlying ActivityRule does allow the activity to be started automatically. yolandyan@ is looking at making the rules for starting activities more flexible (see the discussion on https://codereview.chromium.org/2907693002), but I think this is a relatively long term project.\n\nThe setSheetState call below may, however, be unnecessary, Looking at it now I am not sure where I got this from. I am out tomorrow, but will take another look at it on Monday.",
