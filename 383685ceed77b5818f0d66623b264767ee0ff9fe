I agree that if we add any other types in the future then they\u0027ll likely be things we don\u0027t want to record this metric for.  I\u0027m confident enough in that statement that I\u0027m willing to use your implementation strategy (where we won\u0027t be told by DCHECK to think about this metric).",
