From the user\u0027s point of view, they\u0027ve already installed the site, and it didn\u0027t work for some reason beyond their control or beyond the site\u0027s control.  I think the proper way of doing this is giving the site some feedback so it can show appropriate UI (\"install didn\u0027t work, please try again\") so that the user isn\u0027t confused. Otherwise repeated failures will just have the install button seeming like it doesn\u0027t work. which isn\u0027t ideal.\n\nThat probably needs some spec-related work to figure out the best way of informing the site what the installation result is.",
