      "message": "didStartNavigation: is now called from WKWebView navigation callback. Previously for user-initiated navigations didStartNavigation: was called when WKWebView load was requested. Kurt, do you think we need a separate WebStateObserver callback to tell observers that user-initiated navigation was requested? WebContentsObserver does not have that callback, but if it\u0027s useful on ios, then we should consider adding it.",

      "message": "This interim gap between kicking off a load and actually committing it exists on all platforms, so we should probably be consistent.  The logic can still be accomplished by storing a flag and updating NavigationItems when they\u0027re committed, so I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s strictly necessary.  If other platforms agree that a OnNavigationStarted() though, it would clean this code up a bit.",

      "message": "Sorry, I did not propose to change didStartNavigation: behavior, I proposed a new callback (even though content does not have it). New code looks a little bit complex than the old one and I believe that deviation from //content is justifiable if it helps with reducing code complexity.",

This could be useful, but not in the scope of this CL.  I\u0027m wondering if content also has this issue, or if blink synchronously sends signals so that the WebContentsObservers can handle this more gracefully.",
