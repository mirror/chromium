      "message": "didStartNavigation: is now called from WKWebView navigation callback. Previously for user-initiated navigations didStartNavigation: was called when WKWebView load was requested. Kurt, do you think we need a separate WebStateObserver callback to tell observers that user-initiated navigation was requested? WebContentsObserver does not have that callback, but if it\u0027s useful on ios, then we should consider adding it.",

      "message": "This interim gap between kicking off a load and actually committing it exists on all platforms, so we should probably be consistent.  The logic can still be accomplished by storing a flag and updating NavigationItems when they\u0027re committed, so I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s strictly necessary.  If other platforms agree that a OnNavigationStarted() though, it would clean this code up a bit.",
