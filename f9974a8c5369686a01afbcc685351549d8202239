      "message": "didStartNavigation: is now called from WKWebView navigation callback. Previously for user-initiated navigations didStartNavigation: was called when WKWebView load was requested. Kurt, do you think we need a separate WebStateObserver callback to tell observers that user-initiated navigation was requested? WebContentsObserver does not have that callback, but if it\u0027s useful on ios, then we should consider adding it.",
