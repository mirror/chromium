      "message": "optional nit: I\u0027d vote to not have a data member if we\u0027re going to clear it on each call to GetStatusWithCallback. If there was a second call get GetStatusWithCallback() in any given test, the second call wouldn\u0027t work. I don\u0027t think this is an issue in practical terms because no tests have two calls to the method, but...\n\nA method to CreateStatusCallback that returned a newly created BindOnce might make sense.",
