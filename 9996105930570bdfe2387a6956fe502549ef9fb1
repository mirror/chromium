      "message": "That wouldn\u0027t work because at this point, status_reporter_ should be a NullStatusReporter, which has NOTREACHED in its Waiting() implementation.  In any case, I think it\u0027s better to remove NullStatusReporter and replace it with a null pointer.  See new patch.\n\nAs for the DCHECK itself: I think it was incorrect to have it in the first place. It looks to me like it was already possible that the pipeline could be running in non-debug mode (with need_to_log_status_ \u003d\u003d true), and then be triggered again in debug mode, in which case this DCHECK would fail.",
