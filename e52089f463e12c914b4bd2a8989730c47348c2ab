The older inapplicable-to-HTML character encoding methods mentioned in the RFC (they would be web-breaking BTW which is why we do not implement them, and instead submit \"raw\" data in the form-charset) are instead concerned with representing non-ASCII characters from the form-charset in US-ASCII.\n\nI have added a chromestatus entry https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5634575908732928 and started a blink-dev thread https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/T11QWD2Jyyo/3oS5gCxYAQAJ at your suggestion.",
