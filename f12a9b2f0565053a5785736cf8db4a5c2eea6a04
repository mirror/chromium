      "message": "This patch would effectively drop these DCHECKs. I am not so certain they would really hit very often. It might be more informativeif we dropped the \"if\" and letting the renderer crash when GetFrameWidget() \u003d\u003d nullptr :P. But some cases might hit way too often: https://crbug.com/668106.\n\nSo I was wondering if it is useful to somehow (if possible) systematically track use cases of GetFrameWidget() _when_ we return nullptr due to GetWebWidget()-\u003eIsWebFrameWidget() being false, i.e., the bad cases.\n\nThat I think would help us track down the sources of the problem. One issue which I am hopefully going to work on soon is the IPCs we send out RenderWidget of a still swapped-out frame. This can be easily avoided by simple flag.",
