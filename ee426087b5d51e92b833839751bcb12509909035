      "message": "I spoke to Niels from the TTS Team. He mentioned we just need to set the unit as \"byte\" and TTS will take care of the translation. Let me know if I am misunderstanding your comment. Also, since KB or MB etc is properly handled by TTS, should we add span for them too? The reason I stopped for numbers less that 1000 was to exclude KB, MB etc. Also 1000 will be translated to 1000 bytes and not 1 KB when the unit is set to \"byte\".",
