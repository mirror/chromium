(I was pondering if I should just wait and remove all the old code at once, but turning it on is spread out enough that maybe I should just start removing that on a per-platform basis, eg mac has been on use_byte_certs since m59 already, with nothing testing the use_byte_certs\u003dfalse version.)",
