      "message": "I thought about that, but I liked how you reused the same \u003cextensions-item-list\u003e element for the two lists and wanted to keep that.\n\nIf we were to  make them two separate pages, we\u0027ll have to have two \u003cextensions-item-list\u003e with different IDs in the DOM, even though there will only be one visible at a time.\n\nFor this reason, I think reusing the page but giving a different type makes sense. I think of it kind of like each detail_view page with a different extensionId.",
