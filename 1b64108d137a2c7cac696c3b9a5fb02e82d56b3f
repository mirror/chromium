      "message": "\u003e I haven\u0027t seen UKM code before. Let me clarify what this is doing and you tell me if I\u0027m write.\n\nUKM is fairly new and not many of us are familiar with it yet. That\u0027s partly why all the TabManager UKM metrics are sequestered into this one file.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e This is recording an association from origin (implicitly; this method is only called with an |entry| associated with the origin of |handler.url()|) to a scheme, which this handler handles.\n\u003e \n\u003e So for example, this might get the entry for \"mail.google.com\", and set its \"DefaultProtocolHandler\" value to \"mailto\".\n\nClose, but we\u0027re recording the full page URL. The TabManager.TabMetrics Entry we\u0027re recording is a group of metrics that will be associated with the current tab\u0027s URL.\n\nWe want protocol handler info because we suspect it can help us learn about the site -- if a lot of users have a \"mailto\" handler that points to a URL under the \"mail.google.com\" origin, we can guess that pages under the \"mail.google.com\" origin are mail clients.\n\nThe origin trickery is my way of getting protocol handler data from URLs. We might have a \"mailto\" handler set to a URL like:\n\n    \"https://mail.google.com/compose?to\u003d%s\"\n\nBut when we visit a page, the URL will look like:\n\n    \"https://mail.google.com/compose?to\u003duser@example.com\"\n\nSo if we tried to find which protocols the real URL is registered for, we won\u0027t find any results. If we strip out the path, we bypass the \"%s\" field, and can ignore whatever path-level redirects a site might use.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I\u0027m not sure where SetDefaultProtocolHandler is defined. It isn\u0027t in code search or in this CL. Is it magically generated by a proto?\n\nThe change in ukm.xml adds a DefaultProtocolHandler field to the the TabManager.TabMetrics entry. We do generate code from ukm.xml in the form of \"builders\", which work somewhat like protocol buffers. Given a metric called \"DefaultProtocolHandler\", the class will have a function \"SetDefaultProtocolHandler\".\n\nThe function itself just adds a \u003cmetric name, metric value\u003e pair to the entry\u0027s vector of recorded metrics. See SetKeyEventCount for an example:\n\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/out/Debug/gen/services/metrics/public/cpp/ukm_builders.cc?type\u003dcs\u0026q\u003dsetkeyeventcount\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\n\n\u003e Does it store only a single scheme associated with an origin?\n\u003e \n\u003e What if an origin handles two protocols?\n\nNo, it will store a new metric each time we call the function -- kind of like a \"repeated\" field in a proto, although the backing impl is different. So if \"mail.google.com\" is associated with \"mailto\" and \"irc\", the entry for \"https://mail.google.com/compose?to\u003duser@example.com\" will have two values for the DefaultProtocolHandler metric: \"mailto\" and \"irc\".",
