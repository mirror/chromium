I think we can have a visible browser with 2 tabs: one visible and one isn\u0027t (i.e. covered by another browser window). So this field is to record whether a tab is visible.",

      "message": "I think \"active\" is the word that\u0027s used (e.g. active_index), maybe Michael can comment as well?\n\nThe only browser-property I\u0027m checking is is_browser_focused. The other properties (is_active and is_visible) are both tab-properties. About their relationships, I think the following holds (-/-\u003e means \"does not imply\"):\n\n(i). is_browser_focused -/-\u003e is_active or is_visible\n- A tab in the focused browser may still be invisible and/or not the active one.\n\n(ii). is_visible -/-\u003e is_browser_focused or is_active\n- A visible tab doesn\u0027t have to be the active one of its browser. Its browser should be visible, but doesn\u0027t have to be the one in focus.\n\n(iii). is_active -/-\u003e is_browser_focused\n- Another app may be running and is focused so the active tab\u0027s browser may not be in focus.\n\n(iv). is_active -/-\u003e is_visible\n- Its browser is partially visible, and so its active tab may be hidden.\n\nAs there\u0027s not much overlap and I don\u0027t think any property is redundant, I\u0027d prefer to track them separately just so that I\u0027m not missing out on any corner cases. I\u0027ll analyse these data in a post-processing pipeline.\n\nThanks.",
