      "message": "To me, \"when extensions auto-update\" implies that this is recorded each time there is an auto-update, which isn\u0027t quite right.  Instead, this is recorded once when the ExtensionService is created, iff autoupdate is enabled.  Since ExtensionService is a pretty extension-y concept, and is tied to a profile, I\u0027d probably say something like \"recorded at profile creation if extensions autoupdate is enabled\".",
