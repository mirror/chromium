      "message": "I think we were thinking we don\u0027t want people to depend on these functions going forward - that most code should only need to know about the post-swap time getters.\n\nIt\u0027s not totally clear how this should impact FMPDetector. Do you see it being possible for FMPDetector to ever not need to know about the post-swap time getters? Ideally FMPDetector wouldn\u0027t need these either and the methods could just be removed.\n\nMy inclination would be to leave them as private for now and once we have a clearer sense of the proper way to update FMPDetector, we can figure out how to modify the code. How does that sound?",
