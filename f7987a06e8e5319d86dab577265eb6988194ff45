At best, we\u0027re using this file to scope visibility of the API, which feels weird.",

      "message": "Are you saying that using thread_restrictions.h to scope visibility of the WaitableEvent/ConditionVariable APIs is weird?\n\nWaitableEvent/ConditionVariable should rarely be used because they are a common source of hangs, deadlocks and data races. Friend lists in thread_restrictions.h guarantees that //base OWNERS will review all use cases, which is desirable.",
