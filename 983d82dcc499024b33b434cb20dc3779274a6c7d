It\u0027s my belief that that call is needed for distinguishing between extension processes (which do Weird Things with the cookie store) and normal renderer processes (for which request_context_-\u003eGetURLRequestContext() is the right call).  If I\u0027m correct, I\u0027d much much rather that as part of servicification we shifted over to simply pushing different RestrictedCookieManager interfaces to the two different kinds of processes.  \n\nI had been expecting that that would be a big thing on my plate after you were done with your work, and I\u0027m not trying to shift it between plates.  But I also don\u0027t want to port the current bogosity (IMNVHO) over to new servicification code.

We\u0027re going to be getting rid of URLRequestContextGetter as part of the whole servicification stuff, so depending on it in a servicification CL feels wrong.  OTOH, one of us will eventually have to do it for the same reason, so I\u0027m not worried about it not getting done :-}.  So I\u0027d like this as part of this CL, but I won\u0027t block it.\n\nHaving said all that, is there a reason why SiteContext-\u003eBrowserContext-\u003eStoragePartition-\u003eNetworkContext wouldn\u0027t work?  That would mean that the NetworkContext would be vending the RestrictedCookieManager interface in response to the security info, which is currently in the form of render_process_id/render_frame_id, which is broken, but it\u0027s closer to right than using URLRequestContextGetter (because we\u0027re going to need to keep rpid/rfid around for a bit anyway).  \n\nDo you agree with my vision that eventually the RestrictedCookieManager will be vended from the URLLoaderFactory?  Is there some reason you can\u0027t do that now?  (I don\u0027t know if URLLoaderFactory s are being pushed to the renderer yet--maybe that\u0027s the problem.)",
