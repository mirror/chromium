      "message": "This means that each platform-specific implementation has to provide its own logic to map from (platform-specific-metrics + previous_state + interval_length) to a new level. It\u0027s also not clear what \"instantaneous\" means in this context, since there isn\u0027t really such a thing as thrashiness at any given moment, only some amount of thrashiness over a given interval - if you look at things like base::ProcessMetrics::GetPlatformIndependentCpuUsage() you\u0027ll see that that explicitly states that it measures the usage over the interval between now and the last time it was called.\n\nIf we think that the intervals that you\u0027ve laid out below will be consistent across platforms then I\u0027d recommend instead having the Delegate generate a \"raw\" thrashiness signal (e.g. just an int64 or something), and then have the Monitor implement a single, cross-platform sampling window.\n\nHowever, since that sounds tricky for us to design up-front, without knowing the shape of the other platform-specific metrics, though, perhaps it\u0027s best just to implement the most trivial Delegate API we can think of for Windows, and flesh it out more as we learn more?  i.e. move the intervals below to be part of the Windows-specific impl for now?",

I\u0027ll move these to the Win specific impl.\n\nI\u0027ll remove instantaneous from the comment as you\u0027re right, there\u0027s no \"instantaneous\" thrashiness level (and this function do its estimate based on the previous state, so it\u0027s not really instantaneous).",
