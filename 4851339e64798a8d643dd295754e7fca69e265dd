      "message": "nit: Seems Ok to me, but as you say, we\u0027re adding (unnecessary) extra size to the pending tree in cases where we weren\u0027t showing the top bar to start. I think I\u0027m OK with this, but I wonder if we can do something better for Android tablets, where the top bar isn\u0027t hidden/shown dynamically? If it\u0027s easy to query this, can you add it? Otherwise seems fine.",

      "message": "Regarding extra size, I didn\u0027t want to bundle this here but it may make sense to be more conservative anyway and treat a pre-paint border as required for activation.  IIRC we have a pre-paint border on the active tree to prevent checker-boarding when scrolling.  There\u0027s an argument that for an animated page, we need the same for the pending tree.",

Since we\u0027re in smoothness though, I\u0027m not too concerned about this since most of the time in a scroll we\u0027d be processing the active tree anyway.
