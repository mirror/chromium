      "message": "IIUC, this means clang chose an underlying type for AlphaOption which cannot represent int(-1).  That implies that static_cast\u003cblink::ImageDecoder::AlphaOption\u003e(-1) itself is undefined, per [1].\n\nThen shouldn\u0027t clang also moan in ConstructDeletedValue(), where we *assign* that value?  It seems kinda strange to allow assignment but not comparison to certain (undefined?) values.\n\n[1] http://eel.is/c++draft/expr#static.cast-10",
