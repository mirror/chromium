      "message": "An alternative idea:\nCan we reuse JobController::OnNewSpdySessionReady() for the pooling case?\nWe\u0027ll need to modify |spdy_session_request_map_| to be a map of SpdySessionKey to Jobs. \nWhen a new SpdySession is ready, we notify the Job (via a new method, OnSpdySessionPooled). The Job will reset its ClientSocketHandle (which cancels the socket request if there is any) and calls JobController::OnNewSpdySessionReady().\n\nI am trying to see if there\u0027s a solution to unify the logic and avoid duplicated code as much as possible.",
