I assume they are produced by some kind of Javascript compiler, and my understanding was that such compilers could often produce different names if fields were added/removed.\n\n* Can you write this in such a way that \"giving context in person\" is not necessary? You already introduce a name for gbar.a.bf, and you could do that for gbar.a and bar.pc too.\n\n* Can you avoid \"bar\" as a name?
