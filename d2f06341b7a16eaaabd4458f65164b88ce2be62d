      "message": "Forgive me since I\u0027ve been out of the notifications code for quite a while now, but this feels like the wrong model.\n\nYou\u0027re setting essentially a permanent bit of data on a notification which only has transient effects.  I\u0027d worry that this would cause unexpected effects.  Suppose the notification was redrawn due to an update.  Would it be reshown over top level windows?  Would it be reshown over top level windows of another app?\n\nEven if this is not the case today, it seems like it\u0027d be especially prone to regressions in this type of area.\n\nWould it be more reliable to have a common subcalss of Delegate for all the Ash notifiers that has a struct like this in its constructor, so that the decision could be made on the fly?",

      "message": "The same notification shouldn\u0027t be shown as a popup more than once. After the first time it\u0027s shown, shown_as_popup is set to true (that\u0027s another permanent bit in Notification which reflects past state) and notification blockers are not consulted for it. So I don\u0027t think there are any major regressions here right now (who knows about the future).\n\nI don\u0027t grasp your common subclass suggestion. What are you referring to by \"struct like this\"? Perhaps my other response helps answer this question?",
