Maybe gambard@ knows why the code was written in this way?",

      "message": "This code was written by olivierrobin@. I asked him, and it is a work-around introduced in https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d680472. He told me that IsLoading() was returning the value expected by the distiller when an SSL error interstitial was presented.\n\nThe distiller wants to consider this as a loading failure since the page is never presented.\n\nIt may have been fixed according to olivierrobin. I think that fixing this to use WebState::IsLoading() if possible should be done in a followup CL, probably owned by someone who is more familiar with the code than I.",
