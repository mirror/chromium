      "message": "It feels weird, from a layering perspective, to have the NetworkServiceTestHelper know about the EmbeddedTestServer specifically - I suppose I had always thought of ETS as a separable bit of code (since you could use the Python test server or some other TLS server instance)\n\nThis is why having a service to allow you to Add/Remove certs (the interface of TestRootCerts) seems cleaner, since it avoids coupling these concepts. It\u0027s also something we want soon anyways - but I think you\u0027re opposed to this, Matt, because the code doesn\u0027t do this today?",
