      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that this needs a separate test.  The PaintOpSerializationTest.SmokeTest covers all of this just by adding it to test_flags.  It will serialize every paint flags in that list and verify that it comes out the same on the other end.  The \"fill arbitrary values\" could just be an entry in the test_flags array as well.\n\nYou do also need to modify ExpectPaintFlagsEqual, which currently doesn\u0027t compare paint shaders.",
