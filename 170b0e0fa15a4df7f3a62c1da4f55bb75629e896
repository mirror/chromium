So there won\u0027t be duplication and I would basically prefer to have the serialization code generated by mojo rather than be explicitly spelled out. I can understand the motivation for typemaps when types are shared with the legacy IPC, but I guess in case they\u0027re not, having the types appear in network_service.mojom rather than being typemapped is more readable as it removes quite a bit of indirection.",
