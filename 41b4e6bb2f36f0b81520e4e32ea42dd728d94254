      "message": "I believe you\u0027re now letting the compiler use SSSE3 anywhere it likes inside zlib without a runtime check...\n\nThe usual pattern is to isolate the SSSE3 code to its own build target and set the flag there, much like we\u0027ve done for :zlib_x86_simd.  You might just plop it in there unless you\u0027re very concerned about improving machines with SSSE3 but not SSE4.2?",

      "message": "Right, confirmed same code gen.  I wrote out all the constants this way in the next patch to make it clear that |ones| was epi16, and removed the union.

The bench tool on the bug complained that the computed adler32 was wrong, and it is correct, but this does give us an opportunity ...\n\nI\u0027m going to upload a patch using this \"wrong taps order\" to assess test coverage, I expect the bots to explode ... we\u0027ll come back and fix that later.",
