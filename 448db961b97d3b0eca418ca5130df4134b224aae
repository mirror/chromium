      "message": "i don\u0027t think that this case is properly handled.  to do so, we\u0027d need to cancel overlay callbacks in TransitionToTargetSurface().  i think that would do it.  need another weak factory, i guess.\n\notherwise, we could switch from overlay 1 to ST, then to overlay 2, and get a destroyed callback on overlay 1 while it\u0027s sitting waiting to be released, maybe in shared state or something.  as written, we\u0027d switch away from overlay 2.\n\nactually, i don\u0027t remember how shared state works in MCVD.  does anything keep the surface bundle tied to the CodecImage?  as in, if we transition away from an overlay, but there are VideoFrames that are backed by it, what happens?\n\nin AVDA, assuming it\u0027s not in response to a SurfaceDestroyed, then the surface bundle stays around until none of the CodecImages need it anymore.   this prevents unbacking the frame early.  leaving fullscreen while paused no longer goes to a black video frame, if i remember, for example.\n\nfor SurfaceDestroyed, i think that we go through and un-back them all immediately.",

      "message": "I\u0027m sure you\u0027re right but I don\u0027t quite follow your example. After we\u0027ve transitioned, overlay_bundle-\u003eoverlay \u003d\u003d overlay2. So when we receive OnSurfaceDestroyed(overlay1) we won\u0027t do anything. TargetSurface() will still be overlay2.\n\nMCVDs CodecImages don\u0027t hold a ref to the overlay. Is this a new behavior for AndroidOverlay in AVDA? I think we can easily add that. We don\u0027t even have to clear the ref from the CodecImages on SurfaceDestroyed() I don\u0027t think. Because they don\u0027t do anything with the overlay except hold onto it to keep it alive.",
