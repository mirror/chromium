      "message": "Nit: This may be a little inconsistent with what we do in webrtc: rtc timestamp is always 32-bit wrapped 90*capture_timestamp_ms. In your case it may differ. You may want to consider calculating capture_timestamp_ms first and rtp_timestamp from it. Or change the order of operations in line 527 to take a division first and then multiply it by 90.\n\nNot that it matters to much, since both rtp and capture timestamps are generated here.",
