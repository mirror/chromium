      "message": "These changes make the output of separation lines deterministic. Previously we used the default stroke thickness causing\n1) the separation lines were drawn 2 pixels in height, and the lower pixels may be covered by contents of the next page, which caused different painting of print-subframe.html and print-subframe-expected.html;\n2) the color of the lines were blended which was a potential reason of flakiness.\n\nNow paint exact 1-pixel line in the 1 pixel seam (which is left by line 364) between two pages.",
