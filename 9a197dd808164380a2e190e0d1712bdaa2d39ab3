      "message": "Do we really need set forcecommit to true here?\nAccording to the API doc, editor.apply() should be pretty safe to use. https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.Editor.html#apply().\n\n\"You don\u0027t need to worry about Android component lifecycles and their interaction with apply() writing to disk. The framework makes sure in-flight disk writes from apply() complete before switching states.\"\n\nIMHO, the only thing that really needs commit is that for crash recovery. But if Android/Chrome really crashes, we don\u0027t really care about the notificationId, right? As long as the old notification still contains the information about the download, user can still resume it, i suppose?",
