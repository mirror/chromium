      "message": "Hrm. I\u0027d have kept the IDL bits to make sure that the web-facing interface matches what\u0027s in the spec. That is, I expected more or less exactly this patch, minus the IDL bits. :)\n\nIt makes zero practical difference, since it\u0027s marked `NoInterfaceObject`, but keeping the IDL in line with the spec makes future changes simpler. We also shouldn\u0027t upstream a test that uses IDL that doesn\u0027t match the spec. This test, in particular, needs to remain unmodified.",
