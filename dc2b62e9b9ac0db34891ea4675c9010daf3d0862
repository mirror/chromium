      "message": "I was also disappointed to find that the compiler couldn\u0027t figure this out itself. Overall I think this is fine. Clients should either be using a FooPtr or FooProxy*. If they are using a Foo* then they should have a good reason for needing to support direct calls to an implementation as that implies different semantics.",
