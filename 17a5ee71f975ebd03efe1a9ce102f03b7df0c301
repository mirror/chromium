So if we try to improve the API in the type of ways you\u0027re talking about (which I have all sorts of urges to do as well) we\u0027re taking on the burden of converting from the Posix API at the extensions level to our new API and back, which seems to me to be adding more chances for semantic drift than is wise.

      "message": "Drive by comment:  Some amount of queuing should be supported *if* there is any chance you might use such an interface and care about performance.  \n\nIn my work on QUIC upload performance, I added a batching mechanism somewhat like this to net/socket (not landed yet).   I devised it as a step toward moving UDP writes to a different thread/core.   Even without the threading, I saw big gains just from the queuing/batching.   An important difference between UDP and TCP is that posix writes to UDP are 1:1 with datagrams.   You can do a large write and have the kernel break that up for you into smaller datagrams (unlike TCP which will both fragment and coalesce data into segments).   UDP constrains you to MTU sized datagrams, so batching is the only way to amortize the cost of an expensive boundary.",
