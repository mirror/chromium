We are not always talking about the same navigation, that\u0027s why we can\u0027t perform these CHECKs.\n\nIt seems like this is due to overzealously setting the history offset and length in CommitNavigation, even in cases where the outcome should be clearing the history list.  If we skipped that step in the should_clear_history_list case, could these CHECKs stay?  It seems like that\u0027s more in the spirit of should_clear_history_list (which I think was for tests, though I\u0027m having trouble finding where it gets used now...?).\n\nIf it\u0027s not used anymore, cleaning it up entirely would be the nicest option.  :)",

The intention was to reset session history for each layout test without using a new WebContents every time.  This meant that the renderer\u0027s notion of history length and offset must be reset when a navigation with this flag is seen.\n\nAlso, I was wrong about it not being used anymore-- it\u0027s still used in BlinkTestController::PrepareForLayoutTest.  That means we still need to support that case.\n\nThe code you\u0027re changing here is called during CommitNavigation.  It used to be the place where we reset the renderer\u0027s notion of history length/offset for the layout test case.  Apparently that no longer works in some cases?\n\nYou also refer to DidCommitNavigation as updating the current state.  I assume that means the code in RenderFrameImpl::UpdateNavigationHistory?  That code doesn\u0027t seem to take should_clear_history_list into account, so it wouldn\u0027t reset the length/offset in the cases above.\n\nAs a result, it sounds to me like we might be introducing a bug affecting layout tests, where sometimes they won\u0027t have the history length/offset reset between tests (i.e., exactly in the cases where you\u0027re seeing the failing CHECK).  That could manifest as (potentially flaky) failures involving back/forward, checking history.length, dumping the back/forward history, etc.\n\nIf that\u0027s not the case, can you let me know how the history length/offset is reset after your change and why layout tests are safe?  And can we reintroduce the check somewhere else, like at DidCommitNavigation time?",
