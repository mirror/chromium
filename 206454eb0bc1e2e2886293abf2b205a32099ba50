I am explaining why:\n\n|current_history_list_{offset, length}| is now the history state of the browser when it sent CommitNavigation().\nIt was previously the history state of the renderer when it sent BeginNavigation().\n\n|should_clear_history_list| is about THIS navigation, |current_history_list_{offset, length)| is about the last known navigation from the browser point of view. We are not always talking about the same navigation, that\u0027s why we can\u0027t perform these CHECKs.",
