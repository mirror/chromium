      "message": "nit: while it\u0027s less code this way, I think it\u0027s much more readable to have separate methods and assert each.  I immediately understand\n\n      expectFalse(hasCorruptedWarning());\n      expectTrue(hasSuspiciousWarning());\n      expectFalse(hasBlacklistedWarning());\n      expectFalse(hasRuntimeWarnings());\n\nBut have to look back at the method declaration each time to figure out what\n\n      assertWarnings(false, true, false, false);\n\nis.\n\nI\u0027d much rather we have a few more lines, but have it be more readable (particularly in test code).\n\nIf you wanted a compromise, I could also see a bitmask, so that we could say:\n\nassertWarnings(kNone);\n\u003cadd corrupt and suspicious warnings\u003e\nassertWarnings(kCorrupt | kSuspicious);  // Expect corrupt and suspicious warnings\n\nThat would be readable and condensed.  Not sure if you\u0027d feel like that\u0027s over-architecting, though.",
