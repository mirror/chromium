      "message": "What happens if this is called with the same values?  I can imagine this will be called anytime requestLayout is triggered but the size doesn\u0027t change.  I believe the resize command to blink is smart enough to do nothing if there are no changes, but I want to make sure.\n\nHad to revisit, but I wonder if we should have added a layout change listener to the ContentView to trigger the size change (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#addOnLayoutChangeListener(android.view.View.OnLayoutChangeListener)).  I worry we might have discrepancies between the ContentView size and the WebContents size with this.  I guess this is all in the direction to removing ContentView entirely and having just CompositorViewHolder be the place that triggers gesture events.",
