      "message": "i\u0027m not sure of the naming of is_visible and is_active. i think that \"active\" is usually used to describe the currently-selected tab in a window; this is_active field also seems to track whether the tab is additionally in the last-active-and-still-visible browser.\n\nwhat are the traits that you\u0027re interested in? is it something like:\n\n- tab is active/selected or not\n- tab is in last-active browser\n- tab\u0027s browser is focused\n- ?\n\ni\u0027m not sure of the overlap between these fields. if is_browser_in_focus is true and is_visible is true, will is_active always be true, for instance? if is_visible is false, is is_active also always false?",

      "message": "These are really good questions. :) Here are my interpretations\n1. is_active: the active tab of the latest active browser that is visible. The latest browser may be invisible (e.g. minimized), but it still has an active tab, which will be ignored (i.e. its is_active is false).\n\n2. is_visible: if browser is visible, doesn\u0027t matter if the tab is the active one of the browser and doesn\u0027t matter if the browser is in focus.\n\n3. is_browser_focused: only checks if browser if focused. I think the last active browser can be minimized and the it won\u0027t be in focus.\n\nRe overlapping, if a browser is in focus and is visible then one of its tabs should has is_active set to true. But I can\u0027t be certain whether a more recently active browser could be visible but not in focus -- if so the active tab will be in this browser instead. \n\nSo that I won\u0027t miss any corner cases, I\u0027d like to log fields explicitly and will do post processing to analyse them.",
