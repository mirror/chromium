      "message": "i\u0027m not sure of the naming of is_visible and is_active. i think that \"active\" is usually used to describe the currently-selected tab in a window; this is_active field also seems to track whether the tab is additionally in the last-active-and-still-visible browser.\n\nwhat are the traits that you\u0027re interested in? is it something like:\n\n- tab is active/selected or not\n- tab is in last-active browser\n- tab\u0027s browser is focused\n- ?\n\ni\u0027m not sure of the overlap between these fields. if is_browser_in_focus is true and is_visible is true, will is_active always be true, for instance? if is_visible is false, is is_active also always false?",
