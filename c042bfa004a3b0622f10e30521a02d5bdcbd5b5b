      "message": "This is almost certainly wrong, but since the view is simply snapshotted and animated in, there\u0027s never going to be a layoutGuide/safeAreaInset to key off of.  Since the view will animate to fullscreen, we can look at the rootViewController.\n\nBut this seems gross.  Is there a better way?",

      "message": "A better solution would be to either add the view to the view hierarchy before snapshotting (maybe as a hidden view?) or to animated the real view instead of a snapshot.\nBut both of those are complicated and would probably add new bugs.\n\nI don\u0027t see a better way to fix this for now.",
