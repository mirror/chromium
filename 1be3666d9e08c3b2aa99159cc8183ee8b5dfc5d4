What was criteria on whether or not to use sequence/thread?",

      "message": "The reason I changed the WebDataService stuff to be \"UI sequence\" is because none of that code knows or cares that it\u0027s the \"UI thread\" any more than it cared about the \"DB thread\", at least AFAICT.  It\u0027s really more like \"main sequence\".\n\nI tried to change PasswordStore etc., but I can\u0027t because they inherit from RefCountedKeyedService, which exposes ShutdownOnUIThread(); changing that is not only out-of-scope but potentially wrong since some of that code does, at least today, care about being on the UI thread.",
