      "message": "This is probably ok. It potentially means that SetNeedsBeginFrame could be delayed a little bit (since it\u0027s on the same interface), which could cause an extraneous BeginFrame being sent while unwanted, or delay for the next BeginFrame which could make us lose a frame.\n\nI don\u0027t know that it would really be any worse than as it was before the mojo switch - when we get here the shared bitmap allocation should already be in the pipe so it should really just be a matter of message ordering.\n\nIf we find that in practice we block for long, maybe we can replace saved_frame_ by a queue, but that\u0027s probably not needed right now.\n\nIt would be useful though to add a TRACE_EVENT_BEGIN here and TRACE_EVENT_END in DidAllocateSharedBitmap after the Resume, so that we can see in traces that messages are paused and can detect issues related to that.",
