      "message": "There is no problem with this patch but we might be missing a case. \nSuppose H264 MAIN is reported as supported from HW encoder. If we have multiple sessions going on, InitEncode() would fail. Although we send |external_encoder| instance from here, it would be useless. Would it preferable to send nullptr and detect it in this level? \nDifferently, for decode we have RTCVideoDecoder::Create() that does init. However, we don\u0027t have enough params for encoder init here.",
