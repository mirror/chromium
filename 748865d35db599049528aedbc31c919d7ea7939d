      "message": "Quick note about a potentially confusing thing here:\n\n\"Retina\" in this context refers to a specific \"version\" in the mac port.\n\nSo as far as run-webkit-tests is concerned right now, the full port name of a Mac 10.12 Retina machine is \"mac-retina\", and not \"mac-mac10.12\".\n\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Tools/Scripts/webkitpy/layout_tests/port/mac.py?l\u003d66\n\nThis is kind of a hack, and only really works because we only have one version of Mac with Retina displays on the waterfall and try bots (right now 10.11).",
