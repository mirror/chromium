      "message": "That\u0027s one reason; though we can always cache the start/end colors for the animation. I\u0027d also like to keep individual animations isolated instead of adding them to giant monoliths. The animation set that this eventually gets added to is affected by location bar events and will stop/start accordingly. The only missing piece is the current progress (we could actually write this so it\u0027s not a piece of outside state). I can make this part of the location bar update if you prefer though.",

      "message": "I think my concern is that this animation isn\u0027t the only thing that mutates mUrlFocusChangePercent (because of that all other factors driven off this value have moved to that single function).  I do think that method is too large and should be split up, but having a single point driving the animation of this value is good for consistency.\n\nThe other gotcha with the updateLocationBarLayoutForExpansionAnimation method is that it treats url expansion the same as focus changes.  I don\u0027t know if that applies for this animation or not.\n\nI just think it\u0027s weird to have the url expansion animation \"Animator animator \u003d ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(this, mUrlFocusChangePercentProperty, 0f);\" defined up above and then we\u0027re animating the same thing for the same duration.\n\nSo, I guess I do think we should move it to the same function unless it\u0027s not possible.",
