      "message": "We could indeed move the check up the execution flow. For example, we could avoid creating the ContentVerifyJob for empty relative_path_.\n\nHowever, the unit tests for content_verify_job are way better than the alternatives, so I\u0027m leaning towards this solution for the quick fix. We can revisit a more permanent solution in a follow-up CL.",
