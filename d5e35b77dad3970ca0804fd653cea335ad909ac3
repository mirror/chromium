      "message": "I think what you describe as Passthrough here should just be the standard fence implementation (GpuFenceImpl). A local GL context is not something that typically exist in chromium and having it is an exception to the normal use-case.\n\nThe use of a local context is IMO basically the same as passing the GpuFence to a different process with access to GL. That can be done using GetGpuFenceHandle()+sendmsg+GLFence::CreateFromGpuFenceHandle() so I was expecting the same for local GL except no sendmsg of course.",

      "message": "I still think treating GpuFence as an interface is cleanest. You\u0027re free to just use the GpuFencePassthrough implementation if that fits your use case, but I think it\u0027s useful to have GLFence support the interface as well. See discussion in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/680135/46/ui/gl/gl_fence.h#16 , the earlier version where a specially constructed GLFence needed to be used to populate a GpuFence was very confusing.\n\nIs it ok to just use GpuFencePassthrough for your code and ignore the GLFence implementation if you don\u0027t find it useful?",
