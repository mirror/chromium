      "message": "I think what you describe as Passthrough here should just be the standard fence implementation (GpuFenceImpl). A local GL context is not something that typically exist in chromium and having it is an exception to the normal use-case.\n\nThe use of a local context is IMO basically the same as passing the GpuFence to a different process with access to GL. That can be done using GetGpuFenceHandle()+sendmsg+GLFence::CreateFromGpuFenceHandle() so I was expecting the same for local GL except no sendmsg of course.",
