      "message": "The only edge case I worry about is if |webViewLoadingStateDidChange:| is called before |webView:didCommitNavigation| and |didFinishNavigation:| changes _loadPhase to PAGE_LOADED, it\u0027ll cause the DCHECK(_loadPhase \u003d\u003d REQUESTED) in |webPageChangedWithContext:| to fail.\n\nThis check doesn\u0027t protect that case because _documentURL is not updated to match webViewURL until after |webView:didCommitNavigation| is called (in most cases).\n\nCan you try loading about:blank in chrome with this change and see if it triggers the DCHECK? If not, we\u0027re probably OK for now because for real page loads, [_webView isLoading] is probably false until after |webView:didFinishNavigation|.\n\nThis is another case where I think we\u0027re conflating loading and navigation. Teasing them apart at some point will help clarify the logic here.",
