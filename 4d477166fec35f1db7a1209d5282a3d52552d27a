      "message": "A comment that explains what this class does would be useful.  Perhaps here or perhaps  by the single public operator.  Labelling something as \"helper class\" that \"helps in comparing\" doesn\u0027t tell me much.  For example, does it check whether the two containers are identical?  Check whether individual items in the same positions are identical?  Individual items appear in a different list, even if they\u0027re not at the same position?  etc.",

      "message": "Looking at the implementation of STLSetIntersection and EraseIf, I would think the former would be faster.  Are you sure this change is an improvement?  If so, can you please explain it to me (perhaps in a comment).\n// Use base::EraseIf instead of base::STLSetIntersection because ...\n\nand if it\u0027s an improvement in general, why don\u0027t you simply change the implementation of base::STLSetIntersection to use this technique?  That could have a much larger impact on Chrome.",

      "message": "I\u0027m a bit surprised to hear this. Let\u0027s make sure we understand how they work. They both go through both sets linearly in lock-step, identifying the elements which are in both lists. So far, their behavior should be identical, and O(n) in time.\n\nThe difference is that base::STL functions construct an entirely new container (and we destroy the old in the caller), while in-place functions simply remove elements from the target container that aren\u0027t in the intersection.\n\nIn the case of intersecting 2 identical containers, the former would construct an entirely new identical container (and destroy the old perfectly good container), while the latter just says, \"They\u0027re equal. Check!\"\n\nSo you can see why I\u0027m at a loss why the former would ever be faster. i.e. There should be no cases whatsoever where it is faster, although a null-set would have identical timings.\n\nRegarding changing the global implementation: I would be happy to add an in-place implementation (although I imagine there is generally more debate about adding something to \u0027base::\u0027) but we can\u0027t change the existing one because some people are doing:\n\nC \u003d A intersect B\n\nand need A and B to remain after the operation. We don\u0027t, which is why we can take advantage of the optimization.\n\nHaving said this, yes, we could look around Chrome - using a simple search for the function name - and identify operations which could benefit from in-place. I think the general audience will appreciate us verifying it here first.",
