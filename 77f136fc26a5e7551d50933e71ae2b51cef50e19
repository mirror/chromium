      "message": "I think this is currently difficult because of how HandleCommand() is used in DevToolsSession. I have put up https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/677954 as a proposal, which would make this much easier to do. (I was going to take a stab at changing HandleAsyncCommand() too, but it is currently only used headless, and I do not understand the requirements well enough to change this yet. Perhaps a follow up CL ... or perhaps someone more familiar with headless could have opinions here?)\n\nAs a sidenote: the headless code looks fairly different (as in, the command handling happens without UberDispatcher etc.). Do you know if there are plans to convert to using UberDispatcher/FrontendChannel?",
