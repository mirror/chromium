      "message": "Actually I\u0027m wondering if we can rely on the internal header.\nHowever, if this is changed to .mojom.h or .mojom-blink.h, I think it violates layering. So for appropriate implementation, we have to use \"#ifdef INCLUDE_BLINK\". It means we need to rely on identity between blink::mojom::blink::ServiceWorkerErrorType and blink::mojom::ServiceWorkerErrorType, but it also seems implementation detail and also too complicated...\nThus, I think if we can rely on mojom-shared.h, it seems better than other options.",
