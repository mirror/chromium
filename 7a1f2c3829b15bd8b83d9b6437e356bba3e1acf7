      "message": "If we made UI mode a class rather than just an enum, we could hang onto the \"state\" of that mode on the mode itself. That would be a natural way of resetting the state when pushing web vr mode onto the stack. Even if you like this idea, might not be good in this patch. Nevertheless, wanted to get us thinking about it.",

      "message": "Say we navigate. The browser will do some work and then eventually come back to the UI with a new URL, etc. Couldn\u0027t we have the clearing of this state tied to that rather than poking the UI directly? I\u0027m not against this approach but I\u0027d like to understand why the alternative wouldn\u0027t work. +cjgrant",
