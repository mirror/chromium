See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events#Event_types_and_Global_Event_Handlers.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce the amount of registered listeners in this class by using PointerEvents API.",

      "message": "Now I have tried to replace mouse* with pointer* events, but I found that touchmove and pointermove are different.\nFrom what I observed, touchmove is not sent when tapping (without significantly large motion), whereas pointermove is sent even with smaller motion with the current implementation of Chrome.\nI think it\u0027s not something guaranteed, but I think touchmove gives event in the more suitable granularity of events for our specific use case.",
