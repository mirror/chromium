      "message": "If everything works with SwiftShader instead of mesa then we can make it the default I guess? This will turn it on by default when running in headless, unless the --override-software-gl-for-tests flag is provided, which defaults back to mesa and is used in a bunch of tests. That should probably change (for CrOS Ozone) in a subsequent CL in case it does cause problems.\n\nThis should work fine though since the build flags are checked at runtime. If GN |enable_swiftshader| is off then this CL changes nothing. I guess there is no reason not to also update the ui/gl/BUILD.gn too though, done.",
