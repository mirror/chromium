      "message": "OK, so there are a couple bugs here (thanks for the careful review), but it\u0027s also complcated, so roughly in order:\n\n1. For configured networks:\n* Security can\u0027t be changed.\n* Shared can\u0027t actually be changed, although there is a logic bug where that is no longer correctly reflected in the UI, so I fixed that, thanks.\n* There is also an edge case where a shared EAP network could be changed from non-TLS to TLS, so I fixed that also. (That\u0027s actually an existing bug, in the Views UI, so thanks again!).\n\n2. Correct in that we need to use createNetwork for new networks (guid is empty).

      "message": "2. yes, but don\u0027t that !!this.guid necessarily implies that the network is configured.\nIf a network does not have a guid assigned by shill, network_state_handler will assign it a generated temp guid value (which gets reset once the network is added to a network profile) \nsee: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chromeos/network/network_state_handler.cc?rcl\u003d5d716c4e1fa6bfd6bf2cee13b244ad4b9f645047\u0026l\u003d1433)\nSo, even when a network state has guid set, it might not actually be configured, and setProperties may still error out with unknown network error (as it will not find an existing network configuration)",
