Instead, we need to emulate these sized LUMINANCE_ALPHA formats like we emulate the unsized ones.\n\nYou can look at gpu/command_buffer/service/texture_manager.cc and search for swizzle.",

      "message": "Without really pretending to be an expert in the versioning and\nextension jungle, chadversary@ said in the bug:\n\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d792295#c13\n\n\"\nWhen an OpenGL extension introduces features (such as GL_LUMINANCE formats) that are banned by the OpenGL Core Profile Specification, and a OpenGL Core Profile context supports the extension, the general rule of thumb is that banned feature *does not exist* in the context. If a particular implementation of the OpenGL Core Profile does support any such banned features, that\u0027s a bug in the implementation. You can\u0027t rely on it being supported across implementations.\n\nIf you want specification references a evidence, I\u0027ll provide them. But please request cautiously; it takes time to dig them up.\n\"\n\nFollowing this, e.g. l.1658-1659 would be wrong in gles 3.0.\n\nCould you add more details on the emulation alternative plz?",
