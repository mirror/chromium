Instead, we need to emulate these sized LUMINANCE_ALPHA formats like we emulate the unsized ones.\n\nYou can look at gpu/command_buffer/service/texture_manager.cc and search for swizzle.",

      "message": "Without really pretending to be an expert in the versioning and\nextension jungle, chadversary@ said in the bug:\n\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d792295#c13\n\n\"\nWhen an OpenGL extension introduces features (such as GL_LUMINANCE formats) that are banned by the OpenGL Core Profile Specification, and a OpenGL Core Profile context supports the extension, the general rule of thumb is that banned feature *does not exist* in the context. If a particular implementation of the OpenGL Core Profile does support any such banned features, that\u0027s a bug in the implementation. You can\u0027t rely on it being supported across implementations.\n\nIf you want specification references a evidence, I\u0027ll provide them. But please request cautiously; it takes time to dig them up.\n\"\n\nFollowing this, e.g. l.1658-1659 would be wrong in gles 3.0.\n\nCould you add more details on the emulation alternative plz?",

      "message": "It\u0027s true the LA formats do not exist on Desktop GL core profile. However, we are implementing OpenGL ES, not Desktop GL. When we implement ES on top of a Desktop GL core profile, we need to emulate these missing LA formats.  So what we do is, we use RG format to emulate LA format, and then use texture swizzle to supply RG channels to RGBA channels when sampled, say, we use LA texture to draw to a RGBA framebuffer.\n\nAs I suggested, it\u0027s better for you to avoid using LA formats if you are on Linux or Mac. On Linux we are still using GL compatibility profile so in theory LA formats can be natively supported, but we could switch to core profile GL on Linux anytime in the future. On Mac, we are already using core profile.\n\nThere is a bug currently in Chrome\u0027s command buffer that we only emulate unsized LA formats, but not sized LA formats exposed through extensions. We should file a bug on that. And if you want to work on that, I can provide more guidance.",
