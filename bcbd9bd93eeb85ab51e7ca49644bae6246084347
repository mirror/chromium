      "message": "That sounds like a problem, right?  (Or am I not understanding?)\n\nSuppose process 123 has hung, and it\u0027s hosting tabs A and B.  Tab C is in a different process.  The dialog will show A and B.\n\nLet\u0027s say we\u0027re on tab A while it\u0027s showing, and a cross-process navigation to page D commits in the background (in process 456).  If 456 is responsive, we\u0027ll dismiss the dialog and we\u0027re done.  But if process 456 is also unresponsive, this logic sounds like it will change A to D and leave B in the dialog as well, even though B and D are in different processes and won\u0027t both be killed if the user clicks \"Exit page.\"\n\nIs that what would happen?",

Only if they have pending input on them and the timer has fired.. \n\nWhat is really wrong with this dialog is that Kill only kills the process that is first in the list. So if you have process 123 and 456 both unresponsive. The last one in will only be kiiled; see the Cancel() method only takes element[0].\n\nAgain looking at this class it has a number of flaws and I don\u0027t believe the original author works on Chromium anymore and someone should address all of these problems.",

      "message": "When do we ever show tabs from different processes in the dialog today?  I\u0027m not aware of a way for that to happen, but I could be wrong.\n\nAnd wouldn\u0027t this problem from my example go away if we went back to using OnModelChanged?  If that clears the stale state in the dialog and builds it up again, would we show D in my example (for process 456) instead of both B and D (a strange mix of two processes)?\n\nAnyway, I agree that this class needs an overhaul, and you\u0027re not on the hook to do that in this CL.  I think we should try to avoid introducing new bugs (e.g., showing tabs from multiple processes) if possible, though.",
