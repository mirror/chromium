      "message": "This should mostly work because we don\u0027t allow websites to lock the orientation when they are in a tab. Which means that if we re-parent, unlocking makes sense. However, this is a \"parameter\" in Chrome and we might want to check that before unlocking so we don\u0027t break any content embedder that isn\u0027t following these rules. ContentViewCore.isFullscreenRequiredForOrientationLock() exposes this information.",

I don\u0027t think this will have any effect on the Tab or any of it\u0027s contents, it is purely to unlock the FullscreenActivity so we don\u0027t trigger two orientation changes when we get back to the CTA.",

      "message": "So as discussed offline, indeed, the activity will be killed and I missed it. My point still applies though but because we don\u0027t propagate the state when going fullscreen, it\u0027s probably pointless to require it here. It would be a nice follow-up to propagate the state based on the property of the CVC but not high priority really.",
