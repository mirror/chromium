      "message": "The way it works is as follows:\n\n1) We invoke bower and store all downloaded code under a temporary components/ folder.\n2) We rsync from components/ folder to components-chromium/ folder. The latter is the only folder that is checked into the repository. rsync_exclude.txt is used during this copying at https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/polymer/v1_0/reproduce.sh?l\u003d72.\n\nSo the \"package.json\" file is not generated automatically. It just happens that the newer version of paper-button (and other Polymer elementns), now have package.json files, and we need to exclude them since they are unnecessary for our purposes.",
