      "message": "As mentioned in the bug, this change has no effect because every time a reset profile dialog is shown, it is a brand new instance and the boolean is always re-initialized to false. I verified by patching your CL and undoing the C++ change. I  can still make the browser crash. Only the C++ change in this CL is actually relevant to fixing the crash.",

      "message": "Also by returning early here the crash is prevented, but the UI is never notified about the finish of the async operation, and it will keep displaying the dialog with a spinner. We need to store all pending callback_ids and resolve them properly when OnResetProfileSettingsDone is triggered (with ResolveJavascriptCallback(...)).\n\nHaving said that, I think there is an easier way to fix this from the UI side, which is to preserve the \"clearInProgress\" across dialog invocations. I would be happy to help doing this, since I implemented the UI dialog to begin with.",
