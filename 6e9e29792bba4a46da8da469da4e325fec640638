      "message": "As mentioned in the bug, this change has no effect because every time a reset profile dialog is shown, it is a brand new instance and the boolean is always re-initialized to false. I verified by patching your CL and undoing the C++ change. I  can still make the browser crash. Only the C++ change in this CL is actually relevant to fixing the crash.",
