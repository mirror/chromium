      "message": "OK, but I don\u0027t get how that implies this comment in the commit message. Usually when the single-definition rule is violated, I assume that it\u0027s because of multiple definitions, not because there\u0027s zero (since that\u0027s what the compile error below seems to imply?)\n\nOh... I think I get it. Because it\u0027s marked constexpr, it\u0027s considered inline, which means the extern template business just doesn\u0027t work. I think this explanation could be refined a bit to make that clear, though I don\u0027t have a good suggestion on how \u003d/",
