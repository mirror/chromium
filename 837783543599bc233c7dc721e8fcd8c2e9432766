      "message": "It looks like this is a time period.  It would be nice to register it as a TimeDelta directly, so you could set and read it as a TimeDelta and avoid any potential for misconversion.\n\nWe have RegisterTimePref(), but that\u0027s not quite what you want.  Internally, however, that converts to a TimeDelta (since the epoch) and writes as an Int64 pref.  You could add a RegisterTimeDeltaPref() that does just the latter, and layer the former on top of it.  You\u0027d also need to add PrefService::Get/SetTimeDelta() (and probably change the existing Get/SetTime() functions to call them).",
