      "message": "I observed the following behavior on a LTE chromebook:\n\n- The SCAN button and the network pull-down list are initially disabled when the cellular is connected. The pull-down list shows \"No networks\".\n- When the cellular is disconnected, the SCAN button is re-enabled and the pull-down list remains disabled\n- After a scan, the pull-down list is enabled.\n- The pull-down list is enabled when a scan happens again --\u003e which should be disabled as we don\u0027t want to connect a specific network while scanning. We may as well disable the Connect button\n- The pull-down list is also enabled when the cellular is connected again --\u003e this one can confusing as it\u0027s not clear if select a network from the list will actually connect to that network.",
