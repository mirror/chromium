This loops ~25K times (0xDFFF - 0x8000).\n\nAlso not sure I\u0027m following:\n- make sure any functions that are called during locked-fullscreen in BrowserCommandController to update state early out.",

      "message": "I\u0027m ok with a DisableAll(). For the reenabling can\u0027t you call the appropriate functions on this class to trigger updating the enabled state correctly?\n\nI\u0027m still unclear as to how you prevent other calls from occurring in this class while in the lock state? For example, UpdateCommandsForTabState() may be called at random points.\n\nIt seems to me locked state needs to be tracked, possibly on the WebContents or if applicable to a browser than as a member of this class. Many of the functions that update state in this class need to early out or check if locked. Does that make sense?",
