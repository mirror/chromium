This loops ~25K times (0xDFFF - 0x8000).\n\nAlso not sure I\u0027m following:\n- make sure any functions that are called during locked-fullscreen in BrowserCommandController to update state early out.",

      "message": "I\u0027m ok with a DisableAll(). For the reenabling can\u0027t you call the appropriate functions on this class to trigger updating the enabled state correctly?\n\nI\u0027m still unclear as to how you prevent other calls from occurring in this class while in the lock state? For example, UpdateCommandsForTabState() may be called at random points.\n\nIt seems to me locked state needs to be tracked, possibly on the WebContents or if applicable to a browser than as a member of this class. Many of the functions that update state in this class need to early out or check if locked. Does that make sense?",

      "message": "I think that is mildly weird because it gets harder to reason about the code. For example, if you look at a function like UpdateCommandsForTabState() you would have no way to know it\u0027s effectively a no-op when in this state. OTOH if UpdateCommandsForTabState() early outs because locked it\u0027s pretty clear.\n\nThat said, it won\u0027t address the main issue of someone poking into command_updater. It seems the only way to ensure that isn\u0027t happening is BrowserCommandController shouldn\u0027t expose the CommandUpdater. It looks like it\u0027s only used in a handful of places. Can they be updated to take BrowserCommandController instead and have BrowserCommandController provide the minimal API used by the other classes?",
