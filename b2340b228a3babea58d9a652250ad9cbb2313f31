But why do we need it?\n\nWhen the shelf is shown in auto hide mode, ShelfView should be visible and receive gesture events directly without the need of code here to forward the events.

      "message": "I agree that when shelf is shown in auto-hide mode, the gesture events should be received by corresponding view. The old logic here use visibility_state() !\u003d SHELF_AUTO_HIDE which is false when shelf is shown in auto-hide mode (the visibility_state is SHELF_AUTO_HIDE but shelf is visible). This is the reason why shelf icons can not be dragged when shelf is auto-hide, since ShelfButton will not received the scroll gesture events in this case.\n\nI think the reason that we should keep Shelf::AutoHideEventHandler::OnGestureEvent to help transfer gesture events to ShelfLayoutManager is for the case when shelf is hidden in auto-hide mode. We need to make sure swipe up on the hidden shelf can change its visibility. (I tried to delete Shelf::AutoHideEventHandler::OnGestureEvent, then the tests https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/ash/shelf/shelf_layout_manager_unittest.cc?q\u003dshelf_layout_manager_unit\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d473 will fail).",
