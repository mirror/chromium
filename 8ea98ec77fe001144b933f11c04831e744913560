      "message": "Hey there! Looks like we are gonna conflict. Sadly, there are more yaks to shave here.. While we\u0027re changing all these we should change the callback into a OnceCallback. The function currently being used for all these has a TODO\n\n// TODO(tzik): Update all callers of the Callback version to use OnceCallback.\ntemplate \u003ctypename TaskReturnType, typename ReplyArgType\u003e\nvoid PostTaskAndReplyWithResult(const tracked_objects::Location\u0026 from_here,\n\nAlso, all this repeated code sucks. Since the dependency on content::BrowserThread is disappearing we can just move the PostTask into quota_settings.cc\n\nThis is all done here - https://codereview.chromium.org/2958483002/",
