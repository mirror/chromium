      "message": "nit: Maybe add a comment here that only calls-to-action are of the PaymentTextCell kind, and that this is why they have blue text?\n\nOpinion (feel free to disregard): doing this here rather than where the call-to-action items are created makes the code harder to understand, as it\u0027s somewhat disconnected. I agree 100% in reducing duplication, but if I were looking at the code N months from now, it would be infinitely clearer to me if either 1) the color was set where the items were created (could be set to a constant instead of [[... cr_bluePalette] tint500]), or 2) there was a hint, in the form of a flag or something less generic than \"it is a PaymentsTextItem\" that would explain why it is being styled as is. :)",
