We should just make sure that we don\u0027t create more workers than std::min(kMaxWorkerCapacity, worker_capacity_) in MaintainAtLeastOneIdleWorkerLockRequired(). Otherwise, we don\u0027t end up with the correct number of workers at the end of this scenario:\n\nInitial: worker_capacity_ \u003d 255\nThread 1: BlockingScopedEntered() worker_capacity_ \u003d 256\nThread 2: BlockingScopedEntered() worker_capacity_ \u003d 256 (didn\u0027t change)\nThread 1: BlockingScopedExited() worker_capacity_ \u003d 255 (expected 256)",
