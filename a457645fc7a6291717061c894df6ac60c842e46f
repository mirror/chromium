      "message": "If your ASCII art was correct (and looking at the class myself, I think I agree), then I don\u0027t think we\u0027d want INSETS_DIALOG_CONTENTS at all.  I think we could just set title_label_ to take the full width, ensuring its contents are centered no matter how wide the button is, and rely on preferred/minimum sizing to ensure there\u0027s no overlap between label and back button.\n\nIf we did want to do things the current way, I\u0027d replace INSETS_DIALOG_CONTENTS.left() with UNRELATED_CONTROL_HORIZONTAL (or whatever its name is), and add a comment about what this is doing (avoid overlap with the back button on the left, subtract the same amount on the other side just to keep the label bounds centered).",
