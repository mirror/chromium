I think we could just set title_label_ to take the full width, ensuring its contents are centered no matter how wide the button is, and rely on preferred/minimum sizing to ensure there\u0027s no overlap between label and back button.\n\nIf we did want to do things the current way, I\u0027d replace INSETS_DIALOG_CONTENTS.left() with UNRELATED_CONTROL_HORIZONTAL (or whatever its name is), and add a comment about what this is doing (avoid overlap with the back button on the left, subtract the same amount on the other side just to keep the label bounds centered).",

      "message": "It\u0027s really just a question of who\u0027s responsible for ensuring that padding is there.  The reason I suggested doing it in the preferred or minimum size calculation is that we need the dialog to do that anyway to be wide enough for the content.  We only run into padding problems if this isn\u0027t wide enough, but in that case the label gets clipped/elided, which is probably also bad.\n\nThe exception is if the label content may _need_ to be elided, in which case we might have to do this both places.",
