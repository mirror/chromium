      "message": "Both here and in OneCopy, I changed this to a DCHECK because the early out seems to be unneeded to me. OrderingBarrier() is called before scheduling any tasks.\n\nBut then this crashed cuz when a task is done raster and given to the ResourceProvider, we were zeroing out the mailbox. Which would have made this sync token become empty again, making IsResourceReadyToDraw give the wrong answer~! So I have stopped zeroing out the mailbox in ResourcePool.",
