      "message": "nit: It\u0027s a bit unusual to have a DCHECK(!foo) followed by an if (foo).  I think it might make more sense to write the DCHECK as a NOTREACHED() inside the no_gesture_target block, after or instead of LOG(ERROR) statement.  (You can do a NOTREACHED() \u003c\u003c \"...\" to include an error message.)\n\nRelated question: Is it safe to proceed with the rest of this function if we hit this in a release build, or should we return early?  DCHECKs and NOTREACHEDs are compiled out there.  (It looks like this might be in response to something from the renderer process, in which case the values wouldn\u0027t be trusted and could intentionally try to avoid a match.)",
