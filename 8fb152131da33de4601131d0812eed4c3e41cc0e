      "message": "Oh, modules\u0027 unit_tests was in this patch as well. Not sure that was intended.\n\nI can split it out and clean it up a bit before adding it or delay this patch a bit.\n\nThe symptoms the excludes try solve in this case is symbol collisions. Trivial to fix in general (rename something), but a bit time consuming for someone unfamiliar with the code to decide on a better name, make patches, complete reviews and check in so I lag behind a bit.\n\nI also don\u0027t want any excludes at all if possible.",
