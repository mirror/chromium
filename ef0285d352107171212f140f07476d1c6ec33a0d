      "message": "You seem to rely upon agent being enabled. Is this just a convenience wrapper over StopWorker(version_id)? Why not to use the StopWorker(version_id) explicitly?\n\nThis API (SW domain) is nowhere stable btw, so it is likely to move under your feet. It would not be a great idea to rely upon it in the perf tests - you end up being vulnerable to the changes to the API and would be constraining out flexibility wrt changes to the API.\n\nCan we agree on the higher-level goals of your project? Can restarting browser be used to stop the versions?",
