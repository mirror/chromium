      "message": "Hrm...Is it worth avoiding locks here, in the default case?  We could make initial_connection_type_received_ and connection_type_ Atomic32s, and then only grab the lock if initial_connection_type_received_ indicates we can\u0027t use connection_type_.  It would be much better if we could merge initial_connection_type_received_ and connection_type_ - multiple values requires memory barriers, which are hard to reason about.  If we can\u0027t make them a single value, barriers probably aren\u0027t worth the additional complexity.",
