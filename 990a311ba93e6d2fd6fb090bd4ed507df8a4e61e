      "message": "The painter classes are really just wrappers around static functions and don\u0027t typically store any state since they are alive a very short time. I think it would be best to pass this state down in a different way.\n\nWe typically paint a LayoutObject more than we lay it out so I think it would be better to store the contains_only_whitespace bit on the LayoutObject itself, when the text is set, then use the bit when painting. Another approach would be to store the bit on the DOM node.",
