      "message": "We definitely need content_unittests, which exercises lots of navigational paths that work differently in --site-per-process. (In many cases these tests check for --site-per-process and have separate paths for it.)  Similarly, I believe unit_tests revealed several issues when we started running it with --site-per-process.\n\nSo, I think we should definitely run these two.  I think extensions_unittests and components_unittests would be good to have as well, and I can see skipping the rest.  The list of unittests here was based on who was linking in content, so in theory any of them could be affected by --site-per-process, but in practice we\u0027ve never had a breakage in app_shell_unittests or nacl_loader_unittests.",
