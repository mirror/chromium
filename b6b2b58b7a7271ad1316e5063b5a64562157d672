That is, are you reading it as \"4 distinct URLs loaded\" vs \"4 redirects\"?\n\nPageLoad.Navigation.RedirectChainLength\nServiceWorker.MainFramePageLoad.RedirectChainLength\nSubresourceFilter.PageLoad.RedirectChainLength\n\nmeasure in \"urls\" (although they synthesize from the size of the url list, which is incremented each redirect)\n\nPrerender.NoStatePrefetchMainResourceRedirects\nPrerender.NoStatePrefetchSubResourceRedirects\n\nmeasure in \"redirects\" (but used the same implementation as the above measurements)\n\nI don\u0027t have a strong preference, but I went with the existing (and active) histogram unit measure.",
