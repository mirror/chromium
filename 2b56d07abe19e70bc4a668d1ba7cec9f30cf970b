      "message": "There are two main reasons why line 635 may execute: either (1) the SerializedScriptValue\u0027s mojo message was sent cross-process (causing it to drop its ArrayBufferContents), or (2) the caller of GetSharedArrayBufferFromId passed an invalid |id|. This check raises an alarm if it\u0027s certain that (2) is the cause.\n\nIf shared_array_buffer_contents is empty when GetSharedArrayBufferFromId is called, that suggests that the SSV was passed cross-process, and we\u0027re running into user error with serialization working as intended. If shared_array_buffer_contents is valid but not empty, and an invalid |id| is specified, then that suggests there is a larger problem.",
