      "message": "The \"remove_webcore_debug_symbols\" flag is for developers who are not interested in debugging WebCore code.\n(https://www.chromium.org/developers/gn-build-configuration)\nIIUC this change results in making builds slower for those developers.\n\nHow about adding a new separate flag which makes the webcore debug symbol minimum? (e.g. \"minimum_webcore_debug_symbols\")",
