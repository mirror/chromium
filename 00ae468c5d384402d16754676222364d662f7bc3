      "message": "The \"remove_webcore_debug_symbols\" flag is for developers who are not interested in debugging WebCore code.\n(https://www.chromium.org/developers/gn-build-configuration)\nIIUC this change results in making builds slower for those developers.\n\nHow about adding a new separate flag which makes the webcore debug symbol minimum? (e.g. \"minimum_webcore_debug_symbols\")",

      "message": "Currently we interpret remove_webcore_debug_symbols as a request to cap the webcore symbol level at 0. Another reasonable interpretation (this change) is to treat it as a request to cap it at 1.\n\nIn both cases we are respecting the users wishes, and we are giving the developers the requested build-time savings.\n\nWhen I made this change for Windows I found that going from 2 to 1 gave essentially all of the build-time advantages. Is it different on Linux? That is, are the costs for using minimal_symbols instead of no_symbols actually noticeable? We can only justify the increased complexity of blink_symbol_level or similar if 1 versus 0 actually matters. I don\u0027t know.",
