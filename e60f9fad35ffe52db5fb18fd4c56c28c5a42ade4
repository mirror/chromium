      "message": "A bool exactly encompasses the possible (legal) states. The enum, on the other hand, can express a bunch of states that are *not* legal here. So to me, the bool feels a bit cleaner - a bit more compile-time type safety, if you will.\nAnyway, it\u0027s not a big deal and I\u0027ll leave it to you. If you do stay with the enum though, please add a comment listing the legal values.",
