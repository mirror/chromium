If it is, then this function wouldn\u0027t want to d do much work (see [1]), and instead would want to send the widget_ back to the window-manager (something like [2]).\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/services/ui/ws/platform_display_default.cc?l\u003d245\n[2] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/services/ui/ws/window_tree.cc?l\u003d188",

      "message": "I attempted to replicate the ws::Display behavior of passing the AcceleratedWidget back for mus-without-viz, does that seem reasonable? Perhaps it would make more sense to avoid creating PlatformDisplayMirrors (and just use regular ws::Displays for mirrors) in that config. I\u0027d appreciate your guidance, helping me understand the implications of mus-without-viz for this work, and also explaining how to run mus-without-viz :)",

So it\u0027s unclear what Ash would do with the AcceleratedWidget. Perhaps we should chat about this a bit more? Drop me an IM or we can VC when you have a moment, thanks!",
