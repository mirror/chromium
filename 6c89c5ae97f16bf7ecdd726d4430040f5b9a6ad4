      "message": "It seems like the 2 here and the 2 inset need to stay in sync.  Also the 2 in IconFocusRing::OnPaint(), and maybe in Checkbox() (not sure).\n\nPerhaps we should just have\n\nconstexpr int kFocusRingThicknessDip \u003d 2;\n\nAnd then do things like Rect::Inset(kFocusRingThicknessDip, kFocusRingThicknessDip) and use this variable everywhere else too?\n\nAlso nit: Looks like the args here don\u0027t match either DrawRoundRect() (Rect, float).  I\u0027d just use an int radius arg here; it will call the deprecated version but at least it\u0027ll be consistent about it.",
