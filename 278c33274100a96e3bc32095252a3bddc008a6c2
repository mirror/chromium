It also doesn\u0027t allow mixed non-const enum and unsigned bit fields, so this is changed to unsigned.\n\nAnother choice might be to avoid the in-place constructor, but let ContiguousContainer::AppendByMoving() set is_tombstone_ to true, but this would make ContiguousContainer no longer generic.",
