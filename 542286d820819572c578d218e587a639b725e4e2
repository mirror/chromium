      "message": "So, I am largely thinking out loud here, but this is my concern for Mash:\n\na) chrome starts the ash process which starts up quickly and requests a notification via mojo to chrome (e.g. \"chrome os was updated\").\nb) mojo services are started before profile_manager() is initialized (this may or may not be true today, I don\u0027t actually know, but may also change in the future).\nc) this class is lazily initialized and gets called before profile_manager() is created, or before some code that is usually initialized before LoadProfileByPath() normally gets called.\n\nI may be overly paranoid here, maybe that could never happen?\n\nI guess that adding a notification handler that was initialized before the initial profile load would be bad for multiple reasons, so now that I think about it more I agree that this is a non issue.\n\nKeeping the above just for reference, but sorry for the noise.",
