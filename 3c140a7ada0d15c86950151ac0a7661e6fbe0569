      "message": "I\u0027m aware that the latest clang somehow doesn\u0027t require L43-44 but do we really want to remove code like L43-44 once older compilers are gone? If we omit L43-44, as far as I know, calling BootTypeToString() with e.g. mojom::BootType(-1) will immediately cause a crash or return an arbitrary string, which may make debugging more difficult.\n\nTo me, L43-44 are like DCHECK()s for pointers which I\u0027d keep if the coding guide allows. Even recent clang doesn\u0027t seem to ignore L43-44 when the function is called with mojom::BootType(-1).",
