For some reason the .patch file doesn\u0027t have a changelog description.\n\u003e \n\u003e Are the instructions in the README incorrect?\n\nYes, they\u0027re incorrect.  They assume there are only two commits in your git client branch when doing the rebase HEAD~2 part.  My branch client had many more commits that that, the diff computed by the instructions contained many unsquashed commits.\n\nTo fix: I reverted patches/0004-adler-simd.patch and the README change locally and  uploaded the result (patch set #54).  Then I cherrypicked change #54 into a clean client branch, and used the instructions.  The 0004-adler-simd.patch looks sane in that case, no unsquashed commits.",
