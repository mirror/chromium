This way we have a good way of turning it on/off through preInflationStartup and finishNativeInitialization.\n\nIdeally I\u0027d prefer if ChromeApplication would call PureJavaExceptionHandler.installHandler. Ideally it would be turned off through native after it calls base::android::InitJavaExceptionReporter() in chrome_main_delegate.cc.",
