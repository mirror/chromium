      "message": "Hm... I think instead of stopping the timer we should be removing this queue from the coordinator, as there is no more work for it do.\n\nSeems these should be something like:\nPop();\nif (jobs_.empty()) {\n  // Tell JobCoordinator to delete us\n}\n\nI\u0027m starting to think Han\u0027s original idea was better. The timer could be a repeating timer in ServiceWorkerJobCoordinator. It could go through all the job queues and just check if queue.front() has a timed out job. If so, it does:\n\nqueue.front()-\u003eAbort();\nqueue.front()-\u003ePop();\nif (queue.empty()) {\n  job_queues_.erase(queue);\n}\n\nSorry to give conflicting advice, I didn\u0027t think the problem through.",
