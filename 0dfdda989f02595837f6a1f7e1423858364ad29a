      "message": "Because window.navigator doesn\u0027t work, before or after this CL. These APIs are exported at window.chrome.\nBefore, there was a fallback to window.chrome as well, and that\u0027s the path that was always taken.\n\nNote that there\u0027s a second change here, namely switching from \"chrome.searchBox\" to \"chrome.embeddedSearch.searchBox\". \"chrome.searchBox\" was an old alias to the embeddedSearch version, and there\u0027s been a TODO to remove it in searchbox_api.js since at least 2013. As far as I can tell, the alias hasn\u0027t been used in a long time, so I figured there was no point reimplementing it in Gin.",
