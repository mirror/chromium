      "message": "IMO it is premature optimization to compute saveLayer bounds here. We used to raster on the fly on a real canvas, thus the need to know layer bounds beforehand. Now we always record drawing commands in a buffer. cc::DisplayItemList::EndPaintOfPairedEnd() is a much better place to compute saveLayer bounds.\n\nI think it will be a nice cleanup to remove compositing_bounds on CompositingRecorder altogether.",
