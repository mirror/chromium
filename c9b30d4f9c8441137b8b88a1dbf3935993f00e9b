      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is correct. The overflow rect can have an origin that\u0027s to the topleft of the frame rect, no? So this means your code will:\n- Ignore overflow to the topleft\n- Have too big a rect on the bottom right\n\nWhy can\u0027t you use the visual overflow rect as is? Or, I guess, a union of the two?",

      "message": "Yeah we need to use a union of both. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nWe cannot use only the VisualOverflowRect(), that was the first version of this patch\nand the following test was failing:\nfast/css-grid-layout/painting-item-marginbox-overflowing-grid-area.html\n\nThe reason is that the VisualOverflowRect() always has 0x0 as position,\nand in that test we use margins to make the item overflow the grid area.\nThat information comes in the position of the FrameRect(), so using only\nVisualOverflowRect() is not enough.",
