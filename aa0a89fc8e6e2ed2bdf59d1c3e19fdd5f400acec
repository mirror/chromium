      "message": "LatencyInfo is currently (ab)used to communicate when a frame has an associated snapshot here. To keep this patch a no-op, I converted all AddLatencyInfo\u0027s to SetSnapshotRequested instead of just removing AddLatencyInfo.\n\nIs it okay to figure out how to remove it properly a followup patch? I\u0027m assuming there\u0027s a better way of plumbing that bit other than as an argument to the AsyncFlush IPC (which is how LatencyInfo is communicated before this patch).",
