If most-visited is not enabled, it will do contextual search.\n\nSo my thought was to control it with this flag and use the following command-line flags to turn it on:\n\n--force-fieldtrials\u003dOmniboxBundledExperimentV1/foo/ --force-fieldtrial-params\u003dOmniboxBundledExperimentV1.foo:ZeroSuggest/true\n\nBut this doesn\u0027t seem to work. Is there something obviously wrong with that formulation that you can see?",
