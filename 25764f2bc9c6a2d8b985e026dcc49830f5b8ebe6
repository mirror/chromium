      "message": "I\u0027m controlling the actual inclusion of the provider because there doesn\u0027t seem to be any way to have it default do nothing. If most-visited is not enabled, it will do contextual search.\n\nSo my thought was to control it with this flag and use the following command-line flags to turn it on:\n\n--force-fieldtrials\u003dOmniboxBundledExperimentV1/foo/ --force-fieldtrial-params\u003dOmniboxBundledExperimentV1.foo:ZeroSuggest/true\n\nBut this doesn\u0027t seem to work. Is there something obviously wrong with that formulation that you can see?",

      "message": "Nothing obvious.  But then I haven\u0027t developed on iOS so I don\u0027t know it\u0027s foibles.\n\nOne thing that come to mind: are you testing it on a regular page?  Zero suggest is disabled on certain page types such as the new tab page.  Make sure you\u0027re testing on a non-special page.\n\nOther than that, I have no other other than debugging.  Is the provider getting created?  If so, when you focus, which mode of usage is it trying?  Contextual-URL?  Most visited? etc?  Does that mode return results?\n\nFor reference, contextual suggestion requests are ignored by the server on phone (again a chrome versus chrome-omni thing), so if that\u0027s the mode Chrome is in, that\u0027s why you\u0027re not getting results.",

      "message": "One more thought: if you\u0027re trying with a new profile, you\u0027re not going to see any suggestions.  Yes, I know the NTP will have tiles, mostly from prepopulated stuff that comes from the server.  But the zero suggest suggestions are from most visited, which is purely client-side.  So you have visited things several times on the client in various manners, it won\u0027t have anything for you.",
