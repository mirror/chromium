With the understanding that it\u0027s a constant that may increase in value if we add more form types.\n\nThen static_assert it\u0027s equal to kCount here, and drop |kOther|? In the rare event that PDFium does add a new form type, there will be a mismatch and the PDFium DEPS roll with fail, forcing us to update the Chromium side to keep it in sync.",
