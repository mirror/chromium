      "message": "I haven\u0027t found the exact line where this problem is caused but from some logging I believe the issue is in |LayoutObject::PositionForPoint()| (it is called from |FrameSelection::Contains()|). I\u0027ve been able to reliably reproduce this bug by setting line-height to something small like 0.7. This causes the lines of text to overlap and causes the selection rects to overlap. Since two selection rects overlap one |LayoutPoint| could correspond to two different editing |Position|\u0027s. It seems like right now the bottom |Position| is chosen which is what causes the linked bug. I\u0027ll admit that my solution is a bit of a hack but this is a stable blocker and the branch cut is in 2 weeks. I can\u0027t think of a simple solution.",
