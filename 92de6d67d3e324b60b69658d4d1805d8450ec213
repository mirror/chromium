      "message": "how about we do that in another CL?\n\nThe problem is that these methods are being mocked right now. I would like to make this pass-through first and then migrate the unit test to using a fake in a separate CL. If I deleted this now, I\u0027d have to also put the fake in this CL.\n\nIf that\u0027s preferable to you, I can do it that way instead.",
