      "message": "I had considered that but saw getBorderAlpha() seems to be called to get the raw values [1]. Maybe it isn\u0027t supposed to be getting the raw values and I interpreted it wrong. But if that is true, the size would change here. Maybe that needs to be changed as well.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/compositor/layouts/phone/stack/Stack.java?q\u003dgetBorderAlpha\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d1743\u0026dr\u003dC\n\ngetBorderInnerShadowAlpha() is only called here so we can clearly alter it.\nAnd even if getBorderAlpha() is called for the raw values in [1], I could perhaps add getComputedBorderAlpha().\n\nSo,\n1.) Do you know if [1] was supposed to get the non-raw value? And if not,\n2.) Do you like the getComputedBorderAlpha() idea?",

      "message": "1.) That check should still work. I believe the only case where we change the border alphas is when a tab is regaining focus (from the tab switcher). In tab switcher mode, all of those values should be 1 unless the tab is being swiped away.\n\n2.) We shouldn\u0027t need need the extra method provided #1 works. I don\u0027t really like adding APIs like this since it adds to the confusion of who is responsible for what.",
