      "message": "What do you think about including the tests from eg_cq_tests.json in here? We probably want to run them on main. When something runs on the CQ it should also run on main. I see that your CL covers that.\n\nNevermind - it should be okay because we run ios-simulator on CQ and main? We just have to make sure to not include anything in both?\n\nCan we add the comment explaining what this file is for?",
