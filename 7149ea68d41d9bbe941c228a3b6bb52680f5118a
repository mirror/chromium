Is that file already loaded by the time this code executes?\n\nFWIW, I turned off this check for a bunch of directories that could not use src/ui/webui/resources/js/util.js at https://codereview.chromium.org/2921783003. You might want to do the same here (either inline or by adding an .eslintrc.js in this folder to overwrite the global one).",
