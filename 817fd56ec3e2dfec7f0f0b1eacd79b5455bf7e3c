      "message": "This will likely break drive jobs.  Unlike OnConnectionTypeChanged(), OnNetworkChanged() differentiates between \"constructive\" and \"destructive\" actions.  I imagine Drive Jobs are \"constructive\", so they should be run when |type| is not CONNETION_NONE.  Immediately prior to online signals, an offline signal is sent out to clear out stale state.  This means that by not checking |type| the drive jobs will be kicked off by this offline signal, at the same time DNS cache/jobs and socket connect jobs will be flushed/aborted...potentially terminating the drive jobs with ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED.\n\nPlease read the comment on OnNetworkChanged(), or the original design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ch22_dRHPQJ9QArFMmWl_UyVpl-EDXA0PdljGh2kDF0/edit?usp\u003dsharing",
