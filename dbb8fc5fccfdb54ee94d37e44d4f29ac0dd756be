It\u0027s hard to suggest better wordings, because I haven\u0027t been involved enough in the feature tracker stuff to understand why we don\u0027t want to notify about omnibox navigations from the new tab page.  Is there a CL that adds NotifyOmniboxNavigation() itself, that has comments for it I can go read?  Maybe that would help.",
