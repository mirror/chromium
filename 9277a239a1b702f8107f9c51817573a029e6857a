      "message": "So, I just realized that it\u0027s a bit weird to i18nize the controls here, as the flag *contents* are not translated (chrome://flags is meant to be used by developers, not the general public, and removing the translations saves quite a bit of binary size). Would it be more consistent to stop localizing these strings too?\n\n(Also, meta-question: Who actually makes product decisions for chrome://flags? Is it essentially you? ðŸ˜ƒ)",

I\u0027ll put together a CL to do this. \n\nRe flags decisions. It seems like they are all coming through me because due to being the last person who touched the code. As I work in the UX team, I do discuss feature requests with a couple of people on the team who are interested through being frequent users of the flags page.\n\nThere is one last overhaul I want to get round to which is to make all the switches work the same showing the current state of the flag rather than a future state.",
