      "message": "It doesn\u0027t seem like the coordinate transformation belongs here, but I think the real issue is that these *AtLocation methods are concerning, and seem unlikely to work properly with OOPIFs; |location| doesn\u0027t mean anything for a RenderView in an OOPIF process. I wonder if they should be moved to RenderWidgetHostImpl.\n\nI think this needs investigation (and maybe a comment, possibly also a bug), but it is unrelated to your CL so it shouldn\u0027t hold it up.",
