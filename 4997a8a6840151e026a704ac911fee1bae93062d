      "message": "It would be nice to keep the logic for creating the mojo channel in one place, if possible. Is there a way that we could move the new logic from inside the FontProxy to here? If not, or if that becomes too complicated, add a comment here that the font proxy will create its own channel if one is not provided (otherwise, it looks like there\u0027s a missing else-block).",

In particular, the task scheduler is created after the dwrite proxy is initialized for renderers so creating the ThreadSafeInterfacePtr synchronously isn\u0027t possible in all cases.\n\nAdded a comment instead.",
