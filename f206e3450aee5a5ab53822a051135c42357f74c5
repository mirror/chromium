Thanks!\n\nIIUC SWNetworkProvider has different lifetime with SWProviderContext, which is held as scoped_refptr\u003c\u003e by both SWNetworkProvider and WebServiceWorkerProviderImpl. So maybe we should also modify the existing comments about SWProviderContext?\n\"\n// Created and destructed on the main thread. Unless otherwise noted, all\n// methods are called on the main thread.
