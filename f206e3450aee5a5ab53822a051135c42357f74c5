Thanks!\n\nIIUC SWNetworkProvider has different lifetime with SWProviderContext, which is held as scoped_refptr\u003c\u003e by both SWNetworkProvider and WebServiceWorkerProviderImpl.

I suspect this CL is unmasking some bug in the our current code.\n\nHum, I totally missed that ServiceWorkerContextClient also has a ref ptr to ServiceWorkerProviderContext as shimazu mentions above.\n\nI don\u0027t think we want to kill the bindings in the network provider dtor, since that kills the ProviderHost on the browser. As speculated on the crash bug, it\u0027s conceivable that WebServiceWorkerProviderImpl still is alive and causes IPC with the same provider_id to be sent to the browser. It seems we should keep the bindings alive as long as ServiceWorkerProviderContext is alive.",

      "message": "Looking specifically at client-navigate.https.html, it looks like the problem is we call frame.remove() to remove the Client and then expect ServiceWorkerRegistration.unregister() to cleanly remove the worker. But when we move the Mojo bindings, frame.remove() no longer causes the client to synchronously-(ish) be removed: the ProviderHost stays alive so the Client still exists, which means unregister() doesn\u0027t take effect.\n\nIt\u0027s possible this is a bug in the existing code... I don\u0027t know if its guaranteed that even if the Mojo binding is destroyed as SWNetworkProvider does now, the ServiceWorkerProviderHost is destructed in a \"timely\" manner.
