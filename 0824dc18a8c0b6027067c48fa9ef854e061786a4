      "message": "I have updated the test case a little bit. Now it:\n  - Creates three mapped instances of SharedMemory. They are referring to the same memory address.\n  - Two of them are read/write, one is readonly.\n  - The read/write instances sequentially write content to the memory.\n  - ASSERT_EQ() all the three instances can return the latest content.\n\nThis is the expected behavior to cover the scenario in media/gpu/ and remoting/.",
