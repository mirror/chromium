The old logic was pretty clear that it went common name, then org name, then org unit name.\n\n(There is also a slight difference in that the old code used NSS\u0027s CERT_GetCommonName which returned the last common name rather than the first. Dunno how much that matters. Though CERT_GetCommonName seems to also call this escapeAndQuote thing on top of CERT_DecodeAVAValue, so maybe just call CERT_GetCommonName?)",
