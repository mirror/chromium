Do you have another solution in mind that doesn\u0027t involve adding a dep from //c/b/ui/views to //c/b/ui/cocoa?\n\nI think task_manager_mac.mm can just keep calling chrome::ShowTaskManagerViews(browser) the way it does at HEAD? That doesn\u0027t need a new DEPS.\n\nI\u0027m also OK with just updating chrome/browser/ui/cocoa/DEPS if that makes things easier, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary here. That is, things have moved on a bit from when I added \"-ui/views\" there, and it might no longer be a useful distinction to make.\n\nBut I\u0027m much more hesitant to change chrome/browser/ui/views/DEPS, since any coupling with cocoa stuff there will make it harder to eventually `rm -rf c/b/ui/cocoa`",
