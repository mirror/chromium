I also considered adding a variant of X509Certificate::GetDEREncoded, but it seemed a bit weird to have it in X509Certificate since it\u0027s just operating on a vanilla CRYPTO_BUFFER. (Though x509_util doesn\u0027t seem perfect either. There is some other CRYPTO_BUFFER helpers here already though.)",
