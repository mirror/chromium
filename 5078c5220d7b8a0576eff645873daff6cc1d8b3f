      "message": "ISTM UnderflowDuration still has it\u0027s value, it measures how long the underflow duration is, while this new metric measures the time between underflows. It\u0027s related but still are different. For example, for EME playback. Let\u0027s assume a JS player run a heavy JS function every 1 minute. Then we\u0027ll have TimeBetweenRebuffers being around 1 minute. But UnderflowDuration will depend on how fast the decoder can finish the preroll, where faster decoder, or parallel decoding will be helpful. But they will not help TimeBetweenRebuffers too much. To improve TimeBetweenRebuffers, we need to switch to mojo CDM, which is a totally different solution.\n\nBut I agree no-auto-zero-weighting is still odd and we can probably improve there.",
