      "message": "Apparently this happens in some of the tests, where the navigation_handle doesn\u0027t get set in time for the headers to be set.  The NavigationThrottle documentation says that WillProcessResponse will only be called with then headers are ready, but so I assume this only happens in tests, but I\u0027m really not sure at this point...reaching out to a few people so I can figure this out and write the appropriate comment here.",
