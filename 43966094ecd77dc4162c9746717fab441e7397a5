      "message": "Steven, James, wdyt of this approach? Any gotchas? Since NotificationDisplayService is profile-keyed, we need some profile that\u0027s guaranteed to exist. The signin profile seems to always exist, even post-signin.\n\nI also tried out an alternative where I hung an extra NotificationDisplayService with no profile off g_browser_process (so callsites for system notifications would use g_browser_process-\u003eplatform_part()-\u003eGetSystemNotificationDisplayService()). This is workable but requires changing a lot of places that assume profile is non-null. It seems more straightforward to use a dummy profile instead.",
