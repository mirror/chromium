Can you confirm?\n\n\"active\" is misleading here.  \"eligible\" would be more appropriate.  \"active\" indicates whether or not the override is valid, and so is false for e.g. disabled extensions.  We do this so that we preserve the order in the list across disables/enables.\n\n\u003e Q: |list|\u0027s order is guaranteed to be install time order, right? i.e. that ensures HandleChromeURLOverride works correctly.\nIt should be.",
