OTOH, initializing in the constructor and forgetting to put the same value into PrepareToRetry strikes me as a quite plausible future failure mode.  On the lightweight third hand, looking more closely I\u0027m also a bit uncomfortable about many values not being initialized in the constructor lists, but instead indirectly via function call; when someone goes digging for the initial values they\u0027re going to have a (bit) harder time finding them.  \n\nLet me float one other suggestion, then leave it up to you: If you put all the variables you need to reinitialize on retry into a nested structure with a constructor, you can re-initialize them in PrepareToRetry() simply by assigning a default initialized structure to the member.  That\u0027s only a single place for the values wanted, and those values are in the place people will naturally look for them (the constructor for the nested function).  It also provides a bit of conceptual separation between the per-request values and the per-SimpleURLLoader construction values.",
