It was just creating a TestChromeBrowserState and overwriting it immediately, so the AuthenticationService returned was a real one, not an AuthenticationServiceFake.\n\nThis broke when I changed the factory to return null for TestChromeBrowserState (and it is the only test that broke). Removing this method the test pass as expected.",
