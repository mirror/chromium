      "message": "I tried loading it with a correct full path, but it still didn\u0027t work. It looks like dlopen() allows only relative paths. See fs_load_object() and open_from_libpath() in https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/system/ulib/launchpad/loader-service.c . It may be by design, but I\u0027m not sure about it, so I\u0027ve filed ZX-1518.\nIn either case it I think using relative paths is the right thing to do on Fuchsia.",
