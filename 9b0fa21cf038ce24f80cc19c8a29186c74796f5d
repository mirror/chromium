This is only needed with the particular flavor of param_traits that doesn\u0027t copy the data...",

      "message": "Yeah, I agree that that one is much easier to understand. It\u0027s kind of subtle why this code creates a mojo::Message and then immediately creates a new mojo::Message from the old one. And similar why we\u0027re not passing anything to the mojo::Message constructor below, but instead assign to various fields directly afterwards.\n\nSo yeah, hand-written code is much clearer. The only downside of it would be that any new additions/changes to the CloneableMessage type would possibly require changing the content traits as well, but that\u0027s probably not that hard to live with. And indeed, hopefully all of this will be pretty short lived anyway.",
