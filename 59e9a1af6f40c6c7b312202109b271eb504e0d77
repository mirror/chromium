      "message": "I might be missing some concepts of the auto-fit logic, but as far as I understood it, the only way a span\u0027s start or/and end lines can point to a collapsed track if they are used in a out-of-flow item. Otherwise, the in-flow item will make such span to belong to an actual (non-collapsed) track.\n\nSo, if I\u0027m not wrong, this logic affects only to positioned items. In any case, if we eventually find some in-flow related cases hit by this issue, we can solve them in a different CL, considering that the issue we are trying to solve is specific to positioned items.",
