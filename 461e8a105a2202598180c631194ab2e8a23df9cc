      "message": "OK, let\u0027s do \"test://evaluations/console-filter-test.js@evaluation15\" - a lot of places (e.g. stack traces) only show filename and it\u0027s nice for other people to have context on what the integer means.\n\nI\u0027m a bit concerned about how much churn this could cause in our expectation files. ~Half our tests diff\u0027ed because of this change and a lot of test helper methods like TestRunner.loadHTML are using evaluateInPage internally. I don\u0027t have a better alternative, but something to keep in mind.",
