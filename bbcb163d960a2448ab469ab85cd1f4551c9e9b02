And we certainly don\u0027t want to move everything in the same CL. So do you prefer:\n\n(1) to make the duplicated functions in ProfileInfoCache wrap around the migrated functions?\n\n(2) OR just not to wrap them, because this is done with the risk of introducing additional bugs?\n\n(3) OR is there some other concerns related to GetName() that I\u0027m unaware of?",
