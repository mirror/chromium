I might be missing something?",

      "message": "Yeah some handling like line 154 is missing here, my bad..\nFor the callback problem, I tried to understand this possibility:\n|this| is a blink::WebServiceWorkerProvider which is owned by blink::ServiceWorkerContainerClient which is a blink::Supplement\u003c\u003e of Document or WorkerClients, is it guaranteed that the lifetime of blink::Supplement\u003c\u003e is always longer than ServiceWorkerNetworkProvider? If so, it means |this| lives longer than container_host(), then we can still use base::Unretained() here with some helpful comments. I have not made it clear,, do you have any idea about this?",
