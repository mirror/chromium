/**
 * Provides simple composable primitives for monitoring states.
 *
 * The Android framework commonly makes clients register listeners for pairs of events, where one
 * event represents entering some state, and the other event represents exiting that state. When
 * these events accumulate, it can be difficult to manage all the states and often requires a lot of
 * null checks or other workarounds to get the states to properly interact. This class aims to solve
 * the problem by providing simple wrapper classes that can easily adapt these event pairs to
 * functional strategies with compiler-enforceable type safety.
 *
 * Compare to RAII in C++: just as objects in C++ have a constructor and destructor, which are
 * implicitly run before and after the object is in scope, respectively, States in this framework
 * are associated with an interface that runs some side effects (like a C++ constructor) and returns
 * a handle to an AutoCloseable interface that runs other side effects (like a C++ destructor).
 * The constructor/destructor function pair is called a "scope", and the interface that constructs
 * them is called ScopeFactory.
 *
 * Traditional events, like an Activity's onStart() and onStop(), for example, can be adapted to
 * States using a Controller object. In the Activity example, one can set() the state in onStart()
 * and reset() the state in onStop(). Any State created from that Controller will have the proper
 * lifetime for the scopes associated with it.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *  import static org.chromium.chromecast.base.CompositeTypes.unit;
 *  import org.chromium.chromecast.base.CompositeTypes.Unit;
 *  import org.chromium.chromecast.base.StateMachine.Controller;
 *  class MyActivity extends Activity {
 *      private final Controller<Unit> mController = new Controller<>();
 *      public void onCreate(...) {
 *          mController.watch((Unit unused) -> {
 *              Log.d(TAG, "onStart");
 *              return () -> Log.d(TAG, "onStop");
 *          });
 *      }
 *      public void onStart() {
 *          mController.set(unit());
 *      }
 *      public void onStop() {
 *          mController.reset();
 *      }
 *  }
 *
 * The above example uses the Unit type in CompositeTypes as a way to circumvent the requirement
 * that Controllers and States have some associated type. For simple events where we only care about
 * the state itself, and not any data associated with it, use the Unit type.
 *
 * Importantly, States are composable in several different ways. Two independent States (or
 * Controllers) can be combined with State.both() to create a new State that activates only when
 * both of the original states are activated. Two states can similarly be combined with
 * State.either() to create a new State that activates whenever either of the original states are
 * activated. In addition, an arbitrary number of States can monitor a single State or Controller.
 * With these simple composable tools, complex behaviors can be created while avoiding nasty null
 * checks, maybe*() or *IfNecessary() helper methods, and other hacks that make it difficult to
 * reason about the code.
