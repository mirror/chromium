      "message": "I strongly prefer not to add an attribute or walk the ancestry.\nI took a peek at the current state of things under the button (webView, rootWebArea). It looks like focus is never set on the webView, so I would be fine if we did something like:\nif (node.parent \u0026\u0026 node.parent.role \u003d\u003d Role.WEB_VIEW \u0026\u0026 !node.parent.state[StateType.FOCUSED])\n  return false;\n\nTypically, webView containers are always focused when interacting with a web page (i.e. rootWebArea). Since the launcher seems to always keep system focus on the text field, we can make the above assumption.",
