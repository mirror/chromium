      "message": "\u003e i.e. it could be called twice by a compromised Renderer\n\nI\u0027m confused, normally a Renderer wouldn\u0027t be calling ui/gl/ methods directly since it\u0027s supposed to delegate drawing to the GPU process. Did you mean there\u0027s a way to get the GPU process to call Initialize() twice on the Renderer\u0027s behalf?\n\nIf not, and the Renderer is calling it directly, I\u0027m not sure what benefit extra sanity checks would bring since a compromised Renderer could potentially execute the same code without sanity checks.",
