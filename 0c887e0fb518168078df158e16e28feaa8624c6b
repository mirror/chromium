      "message": "unfortunately LocalPresentationManager is also used by ReceiverPSDImpl, which is compiled into Android. So on second thought, there\u0027s technically no reason why we can\u0027t have local presentations on Android. So I am moving the local presentation manager files back into the main target (we can figure out if we really want to exclude them from Android later)",
