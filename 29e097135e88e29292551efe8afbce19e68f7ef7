There are utility methods that make all these literally one liners. I believe the desktop implementation uses these two:\nPaymentsProfileComparator::GetStringForMissingContactFields\nPaymentsProfileComparator::IsContactInfoComplete\n\nPlease look at billing_address_selection_(mediator/coordinator).mm and billing_address_selection_(mediator/coordinator)_unittest.mm for inspiration. The implementation for contact info shouldn\u0027t vary by much.",
