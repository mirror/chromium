I believe I saw a discussion elsewhere that the listener shouldn\u0027t return base::Value but something more specific (and I agree), so that\u0027s good.\n\nYes, the method can and should be private. It should also not be called \"On*\", that style is used for observer methods. Maybe \"IntegratePushSuggestions\" or something like that? (\"Integrate\" is used elsewhere in this class, but I\u0027m not sure it refers to the same concept.)",
