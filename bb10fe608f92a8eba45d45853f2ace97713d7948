      "message": "So, that part of the spec is implemented correctly right now (as far as my understanding, might be wrong)\nThe return value of the BeforeUnloadEvent is converted to string here. https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/core/v8/V8AbstractEventListener.cpp?q\u003dv8abstracteventlistener\u0026dr\u003dCSs\u0026l\u003d170\n\nThe non-null checking is done in https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/Document.cpp?sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d3354\n\nThe testcase that previously failed has this scenario: a CustomEvent with type beforeunload is fired, and the onbeforeunload function returns a boolean false. \nIn the spec, it should be going to the \"Otherwise\" section of step 5. See the note explaining why the event will not be canceled.\n\nThe test fails because the CustomEvent is not a BeforeUnloadEvent, so the return value is not converted to string because it doesn\u0027t fulfill the condition of the if clause in this file that I linked, meaning it stays as a boolean false. That means it will fullfill ShouldPreventDefault(return_value) and the event got canceled.\n\nBut it\u0027s also possible that we move all the step 5 check for BeforeUnloadEvent or events with type beforeunload here so it will be less confusing. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s better though.",

Should I put the code for the whole step 5 (so, applying the code for all events) or should it be specifically just for Events with the type beforeunload and BeforeUnloadEvents?\n\nAlso, yeah, I understand the spec the same way as you (the second interpretation you mentioned).\n\nWhat I meant by the \"step 5 check for BeforeUnloadEvent or events with type beforeunload\" that I mentioned in the previous comment was the first case and the last (\"otherwise\") case of the step 5. The first case will take BeforeUnloadEvent that has the type beforeunload, the last case will take events that are of the type beforeunload but isn\u0027t a BeforeUnloadEvent :D.
