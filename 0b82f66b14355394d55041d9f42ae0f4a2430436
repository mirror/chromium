      "message": "I don\u0027t think DCHECK indicates \"logically impossible even if there are unforeseen bugs\". I think it indicates \"hey, I found a bug\". The chances of LOG(ERROR) being noticed are much less than a DCHECK, plus there\u0027s that thing in the style guide indicating we shouldn\u0027t try to handle failing DCHECKs.\n\n(We should never get more than one NotificationClosed for a single shown Notification, or a NotificationClosed with an ID that doesn\u0027t match one we requested.)",
