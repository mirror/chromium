      "message": "I don\u0027t think DCHECK indicates \"logically impossible even if there are unforeseen bugs\". I think it indicates \"hey, I found a bug\". The chances of LOG(ERROR) being noticed are much less than a DCHECK, plus there\u0027s that thing in the style guide indicating we shouldn\u0027t try to handle failing DCHECKs.\n\n(We should never get more than one NotificationClosed for a single shown Notification, or a NotificationClosed with an ID that doesn\u0027t match one we requested.)",

      "message": "Right, it\u0027s the \"logically impossible\" part I am not clear on.\n\nCould multiple clients exist such that, for example, a timer closes a notification when it expires and a click closes a notification by the user, in the same frame such that this gets called twice with the same id? If there is a layer that makes that logically impossible, then DCHECK is correct. If that is an unlikely edge case, we should still handle it, and not DCHECK.\n\nEither way we should document the expectations in the NotificationPlatformBridgeDelegate declaration.",
