When we reject the promise here, this means that we only give partial ownership of the promise to V8: in some cases V8 should fulfill the promise, in other cases it should not. This makes the interface more complicated than necessary. I think the ownership of the promise should be passed to V8, and only V8 should resolve/reject the promise.",
