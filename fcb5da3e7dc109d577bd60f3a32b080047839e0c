We don\u0027t have any idea of the range of possible values either.\n\nSparse histograms have unbounded memory growth, and that makes me nervous if different web pages may end up with different numbers of calls to value setters and thus different conflict counts (which it sounds like are likely to be 0 or be exactly the same number of calls to value setter).\n\nCould you consider using something like UMA_HISTOGRAM_COUNTS_100 or UMA_HISTOGRAM_COUNTS_1000 or something in that vein?  (When do you expect developers to call this function?  In a loop?)",
