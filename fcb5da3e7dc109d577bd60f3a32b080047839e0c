      "message": "Good question.  After looking more closely at the file, it looks like every case statement has a blank line before and after.  So this change is consistent with that.  The cases on lines 615-622 aren\u0027t consistent with that style, but did group related messages together.",

On the other hand, the developer may not even notice that it\u0027s not having an effect.\n\nI guess we just don\u0027t really know.  Would it be better to use some other histogram?  We don\u0027t have any idea of the range of possible values either.",
