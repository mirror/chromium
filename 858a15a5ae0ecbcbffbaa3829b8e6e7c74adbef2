      "message": "I\u0027m wondering, is this something we need to serialize, or could it be handled service-side, as a side effect of DrawRecordOps (and top-level Begin/End)? It seems like we\u0027re always serializing the same thing here, and it\u0027ll always be before the DrawRecordOp (and vice versa for the RestoreOp). In particular adding a canvas on the client side to keep track of things seems redundant, because we could reconstruct those things on the service side (since we have to go through a canvas anyway).",

Was missing context, it sounds like you have further uses for the canvas not apparent in this CL.\n\n\u003e Re: DrawRecordOp.

It doesn\u0027t seem substantially different to me to have a DrawRecordOp + size of internal record than it does to have a SaveOp+RestoreOp in terms of serialization size.\n\nHere\u0027s my thinking process of how I got to this question: we have to worry somewhere on the service side about doing more restore than saves (side question: where do we do that?). Therefore we must be counting these things on the service side, and validating these operations. Since they\u0027re implicit with DrawRecordOp from the pov of the caller, it seems simpler/safer to handle that transformation DrawRecordOp-\u003eSave+ops+Restore(s) on the service side (fewer ops, no need for a canvas to count them on the client side, no need to validate them on the service side. IOW maximizing entropy of cmd buffer \u003d\u003d fewer possibilities for possibly security-sensitive errors).\nIf you need the canvas anyway, then maybe this is the better way to go, if you think so.",
