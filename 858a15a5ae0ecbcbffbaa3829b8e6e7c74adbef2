      "message": "I\u0027m wondering, is this something we need to serialize, or could it be handled service-side, as a side effect of DrawRecordOps (and top-level Begin/End)? It seems like we\u0027re always serializing the same thing here, and it\u0027ll always be before the DrawRecordOp (and vice versa for the RestoreOp). In particular adding a canvas on the client side to keep track of things seems redundant, because we could reconstruct those things on the service side (since we have to go through a canvas anyway).",
