      "message": "dpapad@ pointed me at calamity@ who said we should probably use a large z-index maybe 100 in case another item has a z-index. Also, as long as there\u0027s no weird interaction w/ dialogs it should be good. AFAICT, no matter how big your z-index is, you\u0027ll always be underneath a dialog which should be alright. Someone who needs to have a toast and a dialog at the same time will need to put the toast inside the dialog.\n\nUnless there\u0027s a reason to not want a toast above everything else, we should put it in the cr-toast and z-index: 100; seems reasonable. WDYT?",

      "message": "afaik, each dome node will create a \u0027context\u0027 within which items are ordered. The actual number value only matters in a relative sense.\n\nSetting it to 100 (or any number) is amounts to use a \u0027magic number\u0027 in the code, which is something I try not to do (I still do it on occasion, but only after considering alternatives). E.g. why is 100 better than 1 or 1000 or 99999?\n\nTo really get the toast on-top, I think we\u0027d need to move it near the root of the tree (and into the highest context within the peers at the root). (I\u0027m not suggesting this, illustrating the context thing).\n\nAll that said, I\u0027m open to what you\u0027d like. Thanks for asking for my thoughts. I don\u0027t have a strong opinion on this.",

I\u0027m good keeping it at z-index: 1 here since the z-index makes more sense in the local context (cr-toolbar\u0027s z-index is set with each instance as well).\n\nYou\u0027re right that z-index 100 is arbitrary. Let\u0027s keep it at 1 and adjusting in the future if there\u0027s a conflict. Just FIY: cr-toolbar\u0027s z-index is 2 and we have z-index ranging from -1 to 3 in settings.",
