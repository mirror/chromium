      "message": "dpapad@ pointed me at calamity@ who said we should probably use a large z-index maybe 100 in case another item has a z-index. Also, as long as there\u0027s no weird interaction w/ dialogs it should be good. AFAICT, no matter how big your z-index is, you\u0027ll always be underneath a dialog which should be alright. Someone who needs to have a toast and a dialog at the same time will need to put the toast inside the dialog.\n\nUnless there\u0027s a reason to not want a toast above everything else, we should put it in the cr-toast and z-index: 100; seems reasonable. WDYT?",
