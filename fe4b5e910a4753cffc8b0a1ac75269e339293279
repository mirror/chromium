      "message": "If this function only wants a c_str() then should it not take a const char*, so callers do not have to build a std::string if they don\u0027t have one? If you reeeeeally want a C++ object for some reason, StringPiece would be better, but I don\u0027t see the reason here.\n\ntbh same applies elsewhere in this file, but that\u0027s not this CL of course.",

We get the guid() from it.\n3. We test that it made the guid() by calling this function?\n\nThat doesn\u0027t seem super useful to me. (Also line 119 is checking that mad-\u003eguid() \u003d\u003d mad-\u003eguid().)\n\nI suggest you make this function a private/file-local-static thing.",
