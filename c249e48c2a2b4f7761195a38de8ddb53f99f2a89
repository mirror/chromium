Unfortunately making WebUIImpl implement WebContentsObserver leads to other issues (e.g. when to stop observing, what to do with conflicting method names like WebUIImpl::RenderFrameCreated).",

It seems reasonable to delay the the WebUI script execution until after we send the DidCommit IPC, instead of just before.\n\nTBH, I feel like the SendDidCommitProvisionalLoad in render_frame_impl.cc ought to occur before observers are notified, but that\u0027s just me. Any IPC sent up before the URL commit seems like it would potentially be out-of-order. I wonder if there\u0027s a way to get a list of IPCs that are sent from the observers.",
