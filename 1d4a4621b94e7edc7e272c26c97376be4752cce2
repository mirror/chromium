      "message": "Before we were checking IsSecureContext in the renderer process, whereas now we\u0027re just checking the top-level origin. The main difference is that IsSecureContext walks the entire frame tree and checks that everything in the frame tree is secure.\n\nThis *might* be okay; the only case where it matters is when there is WebVR content inside an http:// iframe inside an https:// frame. In normal Chrome, an http:// iframe inside an https:// page would be blocked by default, and only allowed to run if the user selects to run insecure content from a page action item. I\u0027m not sure if the user can get into this state in WebVR. Is WebVR content allowed in iframes?",
