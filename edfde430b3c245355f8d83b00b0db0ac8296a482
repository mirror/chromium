      "message": "Here we are depending on a symbol that\u0027s only included if NTLM_PORTABLE is defined. This won\u0027t compile on Windows, and we shouldn\u0027t try to fix it by including ntlm_client.h all the time.\n\nBy the power of type aliasing, we can introduce a HttpAuthHandlerNTLM::Buffer type that\u0027s aliased to ntlm::Buffer when NTLM_PORTABLE is defined, and to std::string when not. This way we can have zero-overhead plumbing to either the portable NTLM implementation or the Windows SSPI one.\n\nOh and you\u0027ll also need to modify the SSPI implementation to work with the modified GetNextToken API.",
