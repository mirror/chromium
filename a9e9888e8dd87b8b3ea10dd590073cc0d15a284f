In a constructor, a new object is created in the current realm and the new object is treated as if it\u0027s the receiver object although the constructor itself doesn\u0027t take a receiver object.\n\nIn short, the current realm \u003d\u003d the relevant realm in constructors (unless a constructor internally invokes another constructor in another context).\n\n... considering such an insane case (internally invoke another context\u0027s constructor), the best thing would be to use info.NewTarget()-\u003eCreationContext().
