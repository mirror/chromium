      "message": "This raster invalidation is generated by PaintController. Previously it was shadowed by the \"chunk reordered\" invalidation which was generated when we found that the matched old index differed from the new index. Now we treat only chunks moving behind other chunks as reordered, and this chunk is no longer reordered and we use the raster invalidation generated by PaintController.",
