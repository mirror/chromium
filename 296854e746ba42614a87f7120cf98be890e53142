      "message": "To me, the terminology is a bit confusing. I guess that the renderer itself isn\u0027t near OOM, but rather that it\u0027s consuming a lot of memory -- and one that we suspect the intervention would help with.\n\nSo maybe this could be called OnHighMemoryUsage() to indicate that.",

      "message": "To me, timeout makes it sound like something is not responding. But from the updated comments, it seems like this actually means that the detection window passed without the renderer detecting a high-memory situation. So maybe this can be renamed or reworded to make that clear that this isn\u0027t a timeout. Going along with OnHighMemoryUsage(), maybe OnDetectionWindowElapsedWithoutHighMemoryUsage()... though it\u0027s kind of wordy.\n\n(To be nitpicky, I think this method isn\u0027t strictly necessary: the browser could just post one task for 60 seconds, and if no high memory usage signal has been received, it can just reset the intervention state. I think that might be slightly preferable, but I don\u0027t have a strong opinion.)",
