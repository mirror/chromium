      "message": "Why remove this test? It doesn\u0027t look like you have any other end-to-end tests that show that a request from Blink actually gets back to Blink as a valid response. Ideally, we\u0027d do that in layout tests that we could theoretically share, but failing that, I\u0027d expect to see browser tests showing the integration (the test in `credential_manager_browsertest.cc` that this patch removes, for example. :) ).",
