      "message": "A question: Do I need to care about clearing the stored offset mapping when layout is invalidated?\n\nIt seems that although LayoutNGBlockFlow can be reused in a subsequent layout, NGInlineNodeData can\u0027t be reused because LayoutNGBlockFlow::ResetNGInlineNodeData() is always called before a new layout. So it seems that I don\u0027t need to worry about clearing the stored offset mapping.",
