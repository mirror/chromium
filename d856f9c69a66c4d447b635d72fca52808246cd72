      "message": "I\u0027m not happy about having to make a lot of classes from skia public for this (SkReadBuffer, SkSpecialImage, SkSpecialSurface too). I\u0027m going to try adding an override of SkImageFilter to skia/ext which can include private things and having that class expose public classes that are really needed here. So we can inherit that instead.",
