      "message": "I have a few concerns about this approach:\n- JSON.parse might throw\n- synchronous XHR is deprecated\n- synchronous XHR will slow us down\n- we do double work here (we later will decode sourcemap another time in SourceMapManager)\n\nAs an alternatively, how about one of the following:\n1. disregard sourceMapURL entirely in generating sourceMapId. This will work just fine if there\u0027s a sourceURL specified for the script\n2. modify sourceMapManager.attachSourceMap to return a promise which will resolve with sourceMap, and then compute the sourceMapId from the sourceMap. This is more involved, but seems to be more reliable",
