      "message": "I find the below block of code confusing for a couple of reasons.\n\n1) If every form is either a credit card for or address form, then instead of checking \"if (has_credit_card_form || has_address_form)\" this should probably keep the logic of \"if (!forms.empty())\".\n\n2) What if there are three forms on the page - shipping address, billing address, and payments info.  What does this log?  \"Loaded a credit card form\" + \"Loaded a address form\"?  Does it matter that it logs \"address form loaded\" even though we had two of them?",
