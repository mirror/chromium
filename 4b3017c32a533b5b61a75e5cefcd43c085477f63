      "message": "We might have a legacy IPC vs Mojo IPC ordering issue here. The intent is to wait for the IPC sent via ServiceWorkerHandle::OnVersionStateChanged() to reach the renderer first, so when .ready resolves, registration.active has \u0027activating\u0027 or \u0027activated\u0027 state. But ServiceWorkerMsg_ServiceWorkerStateChanged is still a legacy IPC message.\n\nSee also the comment in ServiceWorkerVersion::SetStatus.\n\nIs there a guaranteed ordering somehow with the associated interface stuff we\u0027ve been doing?",

If this struct just has a `base::OnceCallback\u003c\u003e callback`, do we need bool |called|? After running the callback, I think if (!callback) can be used to detect the callback was called.",
