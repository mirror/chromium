Glancing over the docs, I can\u0027t actually tell if this is defined behavior...if no value for the given key exists, then operator[] is supposed to construct and insert a new value, but what does that mean for primitive types? Will it always be initialized to 0, or is the value undefined? Furthermore, what happens if a node ID is actually 0? This code looks like it\u0027ll replace it.",
