So there should be nothing to do here to match that behaviour for mailbox resources.\n\nHowever https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/resources/resource_provider.cc?rcl\u003d6eb43dc33551cb24c7f94e9c8e42ac45d8169fa7\u0026l\u003d1393 for software resources it reports them if there is a *shared bitmap id*:\n- Even if not mapped into the pixels pointer, it counts it.\n- Non-shared-memory software resources are not counted.\n\nSo I think that\u0027s a bug and we shouldn\u0027t count shared memory resources if they aren\u0027t mapped to |pixels| but I\u0027m not 100%. +ericrk",

      "message": "Hmm... I see what you\u0027re saying. I\u0027m not sure we should worry too much about matching existing  behavior, as it seems like that may have never been correct.\n\nBasically, what I think we want is:\n\n- If a resource is keeping memory alive, it should probably dump it.\n- The guid/shared_memory_guid generated later in the function (https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/resources/resource_provider.cc?rcl\u003d6eb43dc33551cb24c7f94e9c8e42ac45d8169fa7\u0026l\u003d1420) should alias these resources across processes so they won\u0027t be double counted.\n- If one process owns the resource \"more\" than the others (is the creator, expects the resource to be returned to it, etc...), it should have a higher kImportance (https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/resources/resource_provider.cc?rcl\u003d6eb43dc33551cb24c7f94e9c8e42ac45d8169fa7\u0026l\u003d1446) so that the memory will be attributed there. This more or less works with GL textures and GMBs due to a 2-layered aliasing scheme in the texture manager (% a bug that primiano is fixing in memory-infra). I don\u0027t think this ever worked for software resources.\n\nGiven this, I\u0027m not sure whether we do or do not want to count un-mapped bitmaps - if the resource provider is keeping them alive, we probably do want to count them, but at a lower importance? Happy to adjust in a follow-up CL though.\n\nFeel free to ping me to discuss further.",
