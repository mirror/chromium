So there should be nothing to do here to match that behaviour for mailbox resources.\n\nHowever https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/resources/resource_provider.cc?rcl\u003d6eb43dc33551cb24c7f94e9c8e42ac45d8169fa7\u0026l\u003d1393 for software resources it reports them if there is a *shared bitmap id*:\n- Even if not mapped into the pixels pointer, it counts it.\n- Non-shared-memory software resources are not counted.\n\nSo I think that\u0027s a bug and we shouldn\u0027t count shared memory resources if they aren\u0027t mapped to |pixels| but I\u0027m not 100%. +ericrk",
