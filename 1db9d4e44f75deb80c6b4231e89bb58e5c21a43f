      "message": "We could go one step further, and have manager handle all the logic via subscribing a callback or event listener, service just need to pass the data over. It makes more sense to me for manager to decide what to do with the data, since I think the service should really just be a data access layer.\n\nThis would also allow service to not keep any data (i,e. we can remove this.extensions_ from service), and not duplicate the extensionsInfo array both here and in manager. The only other place this.extensions_ is used in this file is to determine whether or not to open options in tab or modal, which we can easily move to manager too.",
