      "message": "Given the confusion over when this is called I would prefer to be super explicit. How about:\nOnSessionRestoreStartedLoadingTabs() is called from session restore\nprior to creating the first tab from session restore. Session restore may\ndo processing before this, and if no tabs are created (there was no previous session, or perhaps the data was corrupt) this is not called.\nOnce all the tabs created by session restore have completed loading (or loading is canceled because of memory pressure) OnSessionRestoreFinishedLoadingTabs() is called. If another session restore is triggered while waiting for a load to complete OnSessionRestoreStartedLoadingTabs() is *not* called.",
