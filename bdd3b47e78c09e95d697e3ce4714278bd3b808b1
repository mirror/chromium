      "message": "Note I\u0027m not 100% sure we can safely rely on the lifetime of |anchor_widget|. If an a11y message comes in at an awkward time, it might be possible for bubble_view-\u003eanchor_widget() to be a deleted object. Also anchor_view (and therefore anchor_widget) is not set for all bubbles (e.g. permissions requests in fullscreen). I think it would be better to use BubbleDialogDelegateView::parent_window() and Widget::GetWidgetForNativeView()",
