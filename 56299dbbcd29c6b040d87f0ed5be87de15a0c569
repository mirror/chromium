      "message": "Yes I guess I have two modes for class comments: one is a short sentence fragment \"Controls the blah blah blah.\"; the other is a paragraph with complete sentences. In complete sentence mode, I prefer to use the class name directly instead of \"This class\" or \"This\".\n\nAt least some classes in base/ repeat the class name (AtomicSequenceNumber, LazyInstance, Optional, Pickle, Location), but as you know there\u0027s no official convention and base/ definitely has inconsistencies. I\u0027m also pretty inconsistent myself but when a class looks especially non-obvious I try to write a proper paragraph.",
