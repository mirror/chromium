      "message": "Why UINT_MAX, and why 2 * kSystemPageSize? That\u0027s a significant divergence from the original. INT_MAX was originally chosen on purpose, as a way to catch what would be integer overflows of (signed, 32-bit) `int`, on the assumption that many erroneous callers were using that type instead of size_t, and we could catch them this way.",

      "message": "Also, just out of curiosity: is it really the `- kSystemPageSize` that is making lots of WebAssembly apps fail?\n\nDo they really need exactly 2 GiB, or are we rounding the size up for simplicity, or some other reason?",
