      "message": "Right. For example, my Linux NVidia driver\u0027s max tex size is 8096.  So RGBA8 with 8096, that\u0027s 8192 * 4 \u003e 4096 * 4 \u003d kMaxBytesPerTexSubImage.\n\nInstead of increasing the max byes, maybe you should consider multiple calls per line for wide textures.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know that it\u0027s really useful to do partial rows. I suggest doing at least 1 row.\n\nEven then actually, I suspect some drivers would behave much slower below a few rows, because of swizzling/tiling. E.g. on Intel, 32 rows would be recommended (that\u0027s the vertical size of a \"Y\" tile). This will likely require some tuning to get right.",
