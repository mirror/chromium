      "message": "This is needed in order to force the scrollbar to be on the detail-view element level, and not the \"entire page\" level.\n\nThe reason why commenting it out doesn\u0027t cause any visible issue, because the overflow by default is \"visible\", and thus the #main container sticks out of the default-view element, and forces the \"entire page\" level to scroll instead. But this might cause issue in the future still, because the #main container is still breaking out of it\u0027s parent unexpectedly.\n\nBy having the overflow:auto here, we\u0027re explicitly saying \"we know for sure detail-view is gonna fill 100% of the height, and everything inside of it will scroll\".\n\nSee screenshot comparison with color blocks: http://imgur.com/a/uL2Vn",
