      "message": "I think you can use !AutocompleteMatch::IsSearchType(type) here.\n\nThe only difference relative to your new function is that EXTENSION_APP and CONTACT_DEPRECTED would be included. But from their comments, it sounds like these have URLs associated with them, so even if they\u0027re not likely to have favicons it probably can\u0027t hurt to include them.\n\nIf these types are problematic, it would probably be better to put those exclusions directly here alongside !IsSearchType or as a new function in AutocompleteMatch (or move IsSearchType to AutocompleteMatchType, that does seem like the more sensible location). Or maybe CONTACT_DEPRECATED should be added to IsSearchType, based on the logic below in TypeToVectorIcon.",
