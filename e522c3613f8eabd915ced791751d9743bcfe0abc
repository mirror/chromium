      "message": "(off topic): This is just a straight forward fixing, while there is a few more alternatives, I think.\n\n1) OnceCallback\u003cvoid\u003cDBusMethodCallbackStatus, base::Optional\u003cstd::string\u003e\u003e.\n  The second arg is nullopt in case call_status \u003d\u003d FAILURE. Or,\n2) OnceCallback\u003cvoid\u003cbase::Optional\u003cstd::string\u003e\u003e. nullopt in case of failure.\n  Because the nullopt can imply fail, we can skip the first status argument,\n  assuming no new status will be added.\n\nWDYT?",
