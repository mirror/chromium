You can then remove the wrapping class as well since it\u0027s not adding any value and classes of statics are frowned upon by the style guide:\n\nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Nonmember,_Static_Member,_and_Global_Functions\n\n\"Rather than creating classes only to group static member functions which do not share static data, use namespaces instead.\"",

All the code / docs I\u0027ve seen have this to under media/mojo/services; which should be fine to access media::internals{}.\n\nWhatever accesses them should be in media/ anyways, so internal {} seems reasonable. Can you link me to the discussion on services/audio?",
