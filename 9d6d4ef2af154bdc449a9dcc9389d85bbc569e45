      "message": "I guess this is where you were saying there can be aliasing between back-to-back sources vs. viz sources.\n\nWould reserving an process id of 0 for any source that isn\u0027t forwarded to another process solve the back-to-back issue?\n\nOtherwise, I think this is approach is good since I don\u0027t think there are plans to create centralized sources from two different processes.",

      "message": "The aliasing of BackToBackBeginFrameSources with viz sources isn\u0027t a problem in practice, since if a renderer is using a BackToBackBeginFrameSources then it doesn\u0027t get BeginFrameArgs from browser/viz.\n\nIt might help conceptually to use 0 for all BFS that are only used in the current process and start at 1 for all others. That would make it more obvious what\u0027s going on.",
