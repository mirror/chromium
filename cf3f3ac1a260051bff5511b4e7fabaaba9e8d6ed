There\u0027s no way that one could post ~VFC before VFC completes.  still, fewer base::Unretaineds are better usually.\n\nare there any other calls besides VFC::VFC that happen on non-media threads?\n\nif not, then just have a function VFC::InitializeSubmitter, bind the weak ptr as |this| for the callback, and have it just call WVFS::Initialize(this).  then you don\u0027t need to expose the weak ptr outside of this class.",

      "message": "a problem with this approach is that it assumes that we must be run on the same thread as |provider|, else the weak deref isn\u0027t allowed.\n\nnothing else assumes that, i think.  it\u0027s assumed elsewhere that we run \"on the right thread\" to call Get/PutCurrentFrame, etc.  @82 assumes that we run \"on the same thread as ~VFC\", which doesn\u0027t necessarily have to be the same thing.\n\ni mention this because we have that open issue about whether the submitter can be on the media thread or not.  un-tangling the threading later might be much harder than keeping it untangled now.\n\nthe original init case for VideoFrameProviderClientImpl had the note \"this only happens on the compositor thread while the main thread is blocked\" as a description of why calling into VFC was safe.  we don\u0027t have that guarantee here, which is i think why this is harder than it was.",
