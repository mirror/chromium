You can\u0027t just renumber these values because then value 3 would have different meaning between different Chrome versions.\n\nAlso, the master copy of this proto is in google3, so the workflow would be to make the change there first and then make this change. Alternatively, you can leave old values in-place in this CL - although it would be good to at least mark them as deprecated.",
