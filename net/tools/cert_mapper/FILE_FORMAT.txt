The certificate transparency database is dumped into a simpler (uncompressed)
format that can be quickly iterated by the mapper code.

The dump is a directory consisting of two files:

  entries.bin
    -> This contains the leaf certificates for paths, and an array of indices
       into extra_certs.bin for the "extra certs" that make up the path.

  extra_certs.bin
    -> Contains a sequence of unique certificate data that appear in
       certificate entries "extra certs". Comparatively this file is tiny as
       the number of unique intermediate certificates is small.


entries.bin sequence of ENTRY 

ENTRY is made up of:
  CERT     --  the leaf certificate
  uint16   --  number of extra certificates that follow
  uint16*  --  the list of IDs for the extra certs (the "id" is its order in extra_certs.bin)

CERT is made up of:
  uint32   --  byte count for following data (big-endian)
  bytes    --  the DER-encoded leaf certificate

extra_certs.bin is made up of:
  CERT*    --  the extra cert
