It seems like forcing the callsites to do the mutability wrapping, rather than these helpers, would work to your advantage for your goals.\n\nI would think Mutable-\u003eImmutable would be a toll-free bridge of conversion, while Immutable assigned to a Mutable would be the same. That is, put differently, I would think that the following patterns would all be fine:\nImmutable cast to Mutable - does not work\nImmutable assigned to Mutable - just works\nMutable assigned to Mutable - just works\n\nMutable cast to Immutable - implicit\nMutable assigned to Immutable - does not work\nImmutable assigned to Immutable - does not work",

I certainly don\u0027t want to be requesting an overly broad amount of work, so if I\u0027m underestimating the impact/scope, feel free to push back (or to push towards solving this to make sure your needs are met)\n\nI would think mutable annotations could be assigned from existing mutable fields or from immutable fields, and that would address your concern about the random constant, right?\n\nI\u0027m mostly applying my (limited) experience with the Core Foundation Mutable/Immutable structs (e.g. CFArray vs CFMutableArray) and how those translations work, which seems like a reasonable enough design. However, that may not be applicable here, so push back or flag it if you\u0027re finding that it\u0027s adding significantly more work or developer ergonomic pain, and we can try to work out solutions :)",
