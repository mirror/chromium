      "message": "when this is hidden, it causes the UI to look slightly different from other device pages: there\u0027s a thin gray line separating the \"Power\" heading from the \"When idle\" setting (usually, there\u0027s just empty space separating the heading and the first setting). screenshots at http://www/~derat/no_crawl/20170919/ .\n\npresumably this is caused by the next settings-box div not having a \"first\" class. is there some way to add this dynamically? would it be possible to use .first-child or .first-of-type or something instead?",
