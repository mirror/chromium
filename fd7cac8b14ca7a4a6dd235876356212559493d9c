It would be good to have spell out what is the MRP supposed to do in relation to OnSinkAvailabilityUpdated / OnSinksReceived in the contracts in media_router.mojom if it isn\u0027t already.",

If an MRP forgets to untrack, it wouldn\u0027t affect correctness but it\u0027d be reporting sinks for queries we\u0027re no longer interested in. I\u0027ll add comments to media_router.mojom as a follow-up.",
