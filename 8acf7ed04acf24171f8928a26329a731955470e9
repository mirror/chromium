      "message": "The reason to use command line initialization in these cases seems to be to enable more than one feature (what used to be required before) and not that it tested a different code path. The other tests where only a single feature was enabled/disabled don\u0027t test that either.\n\nLooking at ScopedFeatureList implementation it confirms that as all these methods end up calling into InitFromCommandLine in the end.",
