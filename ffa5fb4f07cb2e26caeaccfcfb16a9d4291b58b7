      "message": "Is this just for types? Who uses this?\n\nNow that I think about it, it\u0027s pretty confusing that we use SessionManager types in ash, but not SessionManager. What\u0027s the long-term plan for types here? Will ash have its own types (like LoginStatus, yuck), or will SessionManager move into ... ash? chrome?",

      "message": "Yep, this is for exporting SessionState enum, similar to stuff under ash/public.\n\nI agree it is confusing. Eventually we might want to move SessionManager/UserManager into their own mojo services. But for types, it should be safe to use everywhere. Maybe I should move them into a \"public\" directory to be more clear?",
