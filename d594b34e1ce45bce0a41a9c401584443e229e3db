      "message": "1. This code executes in the browser process.(*)\n\n2. Surfaces represent the compositing of a layer tree in another process/module. IIUC, this code should only be executed once on any given copy request since Surfaces cannot be put into layer trees again. Regardless, see #3 for why it would be safe anyway.\n\n3. gfx::ToRoundedInt() handles overflow by its use of base::saturated_cast\u003cint\u003e, to ensure the floatâ†’int conversion doesn\u0027t have a out-of-range problem. See: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/gfx/geometry/safe_integer_conversions.h?rcl\u003df24fdd9f84945a521665220d062544275932e246\u0026l\u003d38\n\n(*) Longer answer to #1: This code is executing in the same process as where the CopyOutputRequests originate. We know this because the entire layer tree (with their copy requests) is being \"compiled\" into a single CompositorFrame plus a list of RenderPasses (with the modified copy requests). It is the latter object graph that is being transferred to the display compositor via mojo structs/APIs.",
