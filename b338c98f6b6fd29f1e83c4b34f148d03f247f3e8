The linked bug looks also not informative enough to me, unfortunately.\n\nJust according to your commit message, at the moment, I do not think Timer is needed,\nbecause you can just extend power.mojom?\n\nAlso, it sounds a bit weird to me that you\u0027re exposing raw syscalls because they are prohibited in container for security purpose? More precise explanation is appreciated.",
