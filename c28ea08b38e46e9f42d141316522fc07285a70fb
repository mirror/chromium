      "message": "It\u0027d be nice to make CanRequestURL return false for the error page URL, and it was what I tried initially to cancel the navigation if a renderer sets \"location\u003d\u0027chrome-error://chromewebdata\u0027\",  but that didn\u0027t work out.\n\nThe reason is that this causes RPHI::FilterURL to rewrite the error URL to \"about:blank\" in a lot of places (DidStart, DidCommit in the redirect chain, DidFinishLoad), and it turned out that some of those places actually care about the error URL being preserved.  For example, Android Webview monitors the URL in WCO::DidFinishLoad and has explicit checks against the error page URL for it [1].\n\nI wanted to do this as it just seems saner to not let renderers directly navigate to chrome-error://, plus not doing this causes the external protocol handler to come up.  For now, I\u0027ve replaced this with a narrowed check here in OnBeginNavigation, which works for PlzNavigate.  If we wanted to support the same without PlzNavigate, we could modify ResourceDispatcherHostImpl::ShouldServiceRequest to drop it, but again I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s worth the trouble at this point.\n\n[1] See https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/android_webview/browser/aw_contents_statics.cc?l\u003d67\u0026rcl\u003deb478a08ad6f0944e1ddf17e25948e6686abb300 and \nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/android_webview/java/src/org/chromium/android_webview/AwWebContentsObserver.java?l\u003d44\u0026rcl\u003deb478a08ad6f0944e1ddf17e25948e6686abb300",
