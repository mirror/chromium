Is there any stretching of rects going on here, or am I misreading this?\n\nMostly I\u0027m just asking for some more comments here about how this value came to be so this test is easier to read for other folks in the future.",

      "message": "So, the device scale actually doesnt make a difference because we are calling Aggregate without that calculation. I changed the SubmitCompositorFrame to not modify the the device scale to reflect this. It is squashing and stretching because the outer surface is bigger/smaller than the child surface. I added some comments explaining this. Please let me know if that makes sense.",
