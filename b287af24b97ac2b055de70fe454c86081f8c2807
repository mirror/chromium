      "message": "Possible additional keyboard shortcuts:\n\n - Esc could deselect text (right now there\u0027s no very simple way to do this without clicking somewhere else on the page).\n - \"/\" could focus the filter text field.\n - I know you considered this before, but I still think j/k could be alternate shortcuts for up/down (currently Tab/Shift+Tab). I think this would be nice because almost all other tools (including Gerrit, Monorail, Code search, Gmail, Calendar, etc.) all have j/k set meaning up/down.",

      "message": "IMO, I feel like Ctrl + clicking one checkbox doesn\u0027t seem like an intuitive action for toggling all flags, because clicking one checkbox feels like it should be related to that one checkbox.\n\nCtrl+f to toggle all seems a little nicer, but Ctrl+f is already taken by the \"find in page\" function.\n\nWhat do you think about F (shift+f) for \"flag all\" and f (without shift) for flag selected? Or, alternately, x/X for flag and Ctrl+x/X for flag all?",
