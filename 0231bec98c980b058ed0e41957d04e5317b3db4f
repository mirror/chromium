      "message": "Tried that but it seems we don\u0027t give it a LayoutObject in that case either? We never get here without a LayoutObject. Even if we did, an iframe will only be promoted to rootScroller if it has an OwnedEmbeddedContentView(), which I think implies it has a ContentFrame.\n\nThat means the guilty iframe starts off with a ContentFrame() and is promoted. Then at some point it loses the ContentFrame and we hit this condition here when we\u0027re removing it as the rootScroller.",
