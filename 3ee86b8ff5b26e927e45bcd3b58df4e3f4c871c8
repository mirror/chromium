      "message": "RequiresDedicatedProcess() will return true for:\n- everything in --site-per-process\n- all isolated origins (making this a superset of the previous check)\n- CWS (I think this shouldn\u0027t matter for CWS subframes - those should never occur on other sites)\n- extensions (excluding hosted apps). \n\nThe extensions case is worth thinking through, as that should still use process-per-site.  Since we check that new_instance_impl does not have a process here, we will later call GetProcess() on new_instance_impl, and the very first thing this will do is check if process-per-site is needed, and if so, overwriting process_reuse_policy_ accordingly.  So whatever we set here shouldn\u0027t matter for that case, and process-per-site should take precedence.\n\nIt\u0027s also possible that we\u0027ve set the process-per-site policy as part of SetSite() and will overwrite it here in the case that the SI has no process.  It should be fine since as I mention above, we\u0027ll overwrite it again as part of GetProcess(), but as a general sanity check, we could also check and set the process reuse policy here only if there isn\u0027t one already set on new_instance_impl.
