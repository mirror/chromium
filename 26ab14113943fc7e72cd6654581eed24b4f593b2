      "message": "This import should go at the top. That said, probably a simpler format would be fine. E.g.:\n\nIDS_FOO1,12345,some/file/path\nIDS_FOO2,12346,some/file/path\n\nCan just use \u0027,\u0027.join() and \u0027\\n\u0027.join()\n\nIf you want to stick with JSON, I think you should use a list of dicts:\n[{ \"name\": \"IDS_FOO1\", \"id\": 13245, \"source\": \"some/file/path\"}, ...]\n\nEither way, I think you should make \"info\" a list of tuples rather than a dict. That way you\u0027re not making assumptions about which field to index on.",
