      "message": "Should there be a \";\" here too?\n\nBut also, more importantly, I am not sure if this is the best way to fix this. Basically we are overriding a mixin that is used internally by paper-input-container at [1], and it actually originates in iron-flex-layout.html at [2]. In theory we should only override mixins that are exposed by paper-input-container itself see [3].\n\nCan you take a look at https://pastebin.com/HWDGL8tU which I played with locally? It seems to produce the same result, without having to override an internal mixin.\n\n[1] https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-input/blob/master/paper-input-container.html#L218\n[2] https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout.html#L85\n[3] https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/paper-input/elements/paper-input-container#styling",
