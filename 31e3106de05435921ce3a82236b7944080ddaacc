I used \"Linux\" because I am only testing on Linux, but it is used in BasicDesktopEnvironment, which I believe is used on Mac and Linux. If I were to follow that naming scheme, I would call this class BasicFileTransferProxyFactory. Since it should work on Mac in theory, I could also call it FileTransferProxyFactoryPosix.\nAny ideas?",
