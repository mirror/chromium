Since multiuple clients could be using the service. So what to show for \"setting\"?\n\nI spoke with rhalavati@ earlier about this and he advised that the following behavior would be appropriate:\n\nIf one client has connected, use a PartialNetworkTraffficAnnotation supplied by them.\nIf more than one client has connected (ever), use a general PartialNetworkTrafficAnnotation. This one wouldn\u0027t have a setting.\nHowever I didn\u0027t actually do it! Will update with this.\n\nI suspect the right impl is for PublicIpAddressGeolocationProvider.CreateGeolocation to take the PartialNetworkTrafficAnnotationTag (and int32) as an argument.\"",
