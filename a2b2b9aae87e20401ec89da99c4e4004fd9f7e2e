      "message": "Persisting what we discussed on IM.\n\nIt would be good to make sure we\u0027re not missing a case here. i.e. either a channel is broken (and we\u0027ll error out accordingly, severing the EDK Channel), or the write will succeed with MX_OK.\n\nOn POSIX a pipe might be full, in which case we defer further writing until it signals writability again. this can actually happen in practice under heavy load, so if there\u0027s a similar condition for magenta channels, missing it could mean we work fine most of the time and then randomly have connections severed at other times.",
