      "message": "Hmm, the only effective difference between this and the 32-bit version is the `- kSystemPageSize`. I\u0027m at a conference and can\u0027t dig into it deeply right now, but do we need that page size allowance for a guard page, or anything else security-relevant? We\u0027d not want to regress that on 64-bit, just for the sake of getting a nice round number. Perhaps we can allow all platforms to direct map a nice round 2 GiB while still maintaining security properties?",
