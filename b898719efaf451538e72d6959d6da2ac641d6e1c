      "message": "The Map functions are for use with normal transforms, Project is for use with inverted transforms. There\u0027s no special case fast path for project with 2dAxisAlignedTransform.\n\nSince this transform is very simple, I can see that maybe Map is okay to use here, but this is where linalg falls off. Could you confirm that this will give the correct results. Maybe you can lean on vollick@ for help if needed?",
