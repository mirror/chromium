      "message": "A service\u0027s level of sandboxing is configured in the service manifest. The chrome_win_util manifest has \"none\" for sandbox, so the code runs without a sandbox as is the case today with this set_disable_sandbox() call.\n\nI have checked that the code in the service gets called and returns correctly, but I have trouble with the pinning part. When I pin my local build on the taskbar (right click, then pin on the chrome icon in the taskbar), it is reported in the C:\\Users\\jcivelli\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Quick Launch\\User Pinned\\TaskBar as C:\\Users\\jcivelli\\AppData\\Local\\Chromium\\Application\\chrome.exe when my local build is at D:\\chromium\\src\\out\\Default. So my local build is never reported as pinned because of the location mismatch.\nDo you know how to pin a local build correctly?",
