      "message": "(semi-random place for this comment): The reason we pass in api_permissions here (and, as a result, to this method as a whole) is because chrome://favicon and chrome://thumbnail are conditionally allowed based on whether the extension has the favicon API permission.  These are used in a pseudo-API call by doing something like fetch(\u0027chrome://favicon/https://www.google.com\u0027). But these URLs were never intended to be *manipulated* by the extension.  I don\u0027t think we should take them into account for DNR, since I don\u0027t think we would want to intercept any calls to them (and they should be properly filtered out by various checks in the webRequest layer).",
