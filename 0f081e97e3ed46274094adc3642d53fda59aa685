      "message": "I wanted to avoid resize events due to scrollbars coming in and out of existence during a single layout - seems like suppressed scrollbars early in layout should avoid causing a resize. That said, this doesn\u0027t fire a resize if the page loads with a scrollbar. IMO, it should, when we navigate to a page we start off with no content. If the content adds a scrollbar due to overflow, we should get a resize event on the visual viewport. I\u0027ve moved this code to trace the viewport size before and after a layout in the FrameView. I\u0027ve also added an explicit test for this case.",
