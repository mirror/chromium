      "message": "I wonder, what non-computed style related classes use CSSProperties? If there are many things that use CSSProperties but not for the computed style stuff, maybe eventually we could move computed style logic into a separate class? e.g.\n\n        CSSProperties\n      /               \\ \nshorthand writer    ComputedStyle\n                      /          \\\n         computed style writer   style builder writer\n\nBut a lot of things need to be fixed before this can happen e.g. handling of names, flipping around the inheritance of ComputedStyle/StyleBuilder.",
