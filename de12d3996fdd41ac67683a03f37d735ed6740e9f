      "message": "I wonder, what non-computed style related classes use CSSProperties? If there are many things that use CSSProperties but not for the computed style stuff, maybe eventually we could move computed style logic into a separate class? e.g.\n\n        CSSProperties\n      /               \\ \nshorthand writer    ComputedStyle\n                      /          \\\n         computed style writer   style builder writer\n\nBut a lot of things need to be fixed before this can happen e.g. handling of names, flipping around the inheritance of ComputedStyle/StyleBuilder.",

      "message": "CSSProperties is now used in (was inherited by)\n\nmake_style_builder, \nmake_css_property_api_base, \nmake_style_shorthands, \nmake_cssom_types, \nmake_css_property_names\n\nStyleBuilderWriter is inherited by\n\nmake_css_value_id_mappings\nmake_computed_style_base\n\n\nI found that after the refactors I have in flight right now, make_computed_style_base doesn\u0027t actually use any of the StyleBuilderWriter methods, and have made it just a json5_generator.Writer instead. I haven\u0027t looked closely, but I think make_css_value_id_mappings will be the same.\n\nSo yeah, I think the ComputedStyle based inheritance that you\u0027ve got above looks like a good idea, especially given that flipping the inheritance of StyleBuilder/ComputedStyle is easy :)",
