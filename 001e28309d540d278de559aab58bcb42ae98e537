How is a new caller supposed to ensure that their usage of the factory is sequenced w.r.t some other random part of the code base?\n\nI think we usually get away with calls-must-be-sequenced requirements for object instances that are expected to have a single owner (or a small tightly controlled group of users that have some shared guarantees about sequencing).",
