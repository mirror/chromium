      "message": "Sorry for blocking you. I feel slightly uncomfortable with the fact that this overrides this method and defines its own renderer_interface_.\n\nThinking about this a bit further... what do you think about something like below?\n\n- Add OverrideRendererInterfaceForTesting() method to MockRenderProcessHost\n- This could take std::unique_ptr\u003cmojo::AssociatedInterfacePtr\u003cmojom::Renderer\u003e\u003e and can internally just override its renderer_interface_\n- The callsite (i.e. EmbeddedWorkerTestHelper) can use that to install its own Renderer",

      "message": "Yes, I also think it\u0027s a bit strange to have own |renderer_interface_|, and also I felt it\u0027s odd to have mojom::Renderer related thing in content/public.\nHowever, as we talked offline, I agree that making a new mock class only for overriding mojom::Renderer is not straightforward and we can add OverrideRendererInterfaceForTesting() because we already have the member of std::unique_ptr\u003cmojo::AssociatedInterfacePtr\u003cmojom::Renderer\u003e\u003e and it\u0027s testing class.\n\nUpdated like that.",
