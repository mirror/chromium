The PrefService that I get from Profile::GetPrefService() runs on the UI thread (in the sense that this is where its Getters and Setters should be called in a synchronous fashion) but the CL description says \"Move the pref service from the IO thread to a task scheduler sequence.\"\nCould you explain this to me please? Thanks.",
