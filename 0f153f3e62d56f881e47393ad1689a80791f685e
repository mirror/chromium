      "message": "Hmm, this looks too redundant. I do expect in case of single item position change indices are updated automatically, regardless of D\u0026D operation. Technically I can do the same effect by just calling the same function. I think item position needs to be updated on changing position in hierarchy.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "There are multiple cases for item views reorder:\n1. Drag one item to another position in root grid\n2. Drag one item outside folder to root grid\n3. Drag one item outside folder and folder is destructed as there\u0027s only one item left.\n4. Drag item into folder.\n5. Drag and cancel dragging.\n\nWe need to keep track of index of dragged view, folder item view and newly created item view. Also there are other views that are children of AppsGridView such as |suggestions_container_view_|. Moreover, there is a dynamically created TopIconAnimationView added as a child view. These add difficulty to correctly track the index where we should reorder to.\n\nI think this function only is triggered only after a dragging ends, which will not cause too much burden.",
