      "message": "If you track this through, this delegate method is already called in |tabSwitcherDismissWithModel:animated:| at line 837.  Calling it twice seems like a mistake.\n\nWhen the experiment is enabled, this call here triggers BVC presentation, and then the first line of |tabSwitcherDismissWithModel:animated:| tries to dismiss any modals, which ends up immediately dismissing the incoming BVC.  This breaks the transition, because the BVC never shows up after you tap on a tab in the switcher.",
