In those cases, shouldn\u0027t they use kDefaultPlaceholderTextColor (with 0x83 alpha if IsSecondaryUiMaterial?). So, it seems like the desired change is:\n(1) Init placeholder_text_color_ to kDefaultPlaceholderTextColor in the ctor.\n(2) Change the alpha to 0x83 in the ctor if IsSecondaryUiMaterial.\n(3) Continue allowing callers to override placeholder_text_color_.\n(4) Use |placeholder_text_color_| as-is here, without alpha changes.\n\nThat seems like it should allow CrOS UI elements to override the color without being affected by alpha changes, and continue to use the intended default color elsewhere.",
