      "message": "My main rationale for doing it this way, was to keep the references to find() and find_first_of() confined in the function itself, to keep the mystery level relatively low.\n\nI considering adding some kind of searcher functor that replaces |find_this| in the argument list, but it would need to hold both match_length and find_fn back here, which makes it awkward, and I think it\u0027s not any more scrutable than this.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve done in the latest patch set, is to just have the find_fn passed as a parameter, in an attempt to make the call sites more readable. Let me know what you think.",
