      "message": "can we clarify what the objective of this file is for my own understanding?  I think it might help clarify the name.\n\nObjective of this script from my perspective (please correct me I am coming a little late to this party): \n\n1) path to this script is passed by chromium_test recipe module to the swarming recipe module.\n2) swarming recipe module invokes this script instead of swarming.py trigger\n3) this script then invokes swarming.py trigger n times, where n is the number perf devices for the current unique configuration\n\nIs this script supposed to do anything else besides that?  (full disclosure I haven\u0027t looked at the code in this script yet)\n\nI think the name you have lines up well with that.  I guess I just didn\u0027t get that from the comments at the top of the file.\n\ncan you maybe expand and/or clarify the comments section?",
