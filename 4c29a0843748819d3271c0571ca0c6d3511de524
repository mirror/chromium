      "message": "Would we make sense to define some wrapper callback template that wraps a real callback and implements WorkerThread::Observer, therefore it can delete the callback internally if it gets notified?  Would it result in too much templating?  This request_id thing makes me feel a bit sad (while it\u0027s not your fault at all, to be clear... sorry for the rant)",
