The first number encodes the OS version, which will vary among client machines I assume? Or maybe it refers to the latest OS version the driver targets.\n\nhttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005654/graphics-drivers.html\n\nAnyway, if you\u0027ve tested this locally it\u0027s just something we should consider for the future.",
