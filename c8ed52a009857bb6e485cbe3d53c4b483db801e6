      "message": "One problem with this approach in general is that it couples the the lifetime of this coordinator to the disabler. If this coordinator were changed to be long-lived, then fullscreen would just stop working and wouldn\u0027t be at all obvious why.\n\nAt the very least I think the disabler should be set to nil in -disconnect (or -stop). \n\nLonger-term I think I\u0027d prefer a mechanism where the content view controller disables fullscreen when anything is presented from it, but I suspect that\u0027s difficult right now.",
