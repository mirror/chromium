      "message": "Having this here looks right to me because it means LocalSurfaceId survives cross-process navigations by the child. It appears that the new OOPIF in the new process will get the old LocalSurfaceId when it gets its initial resize, and so the LocalSurfaceId will just get reused. I\u0027m just noting this because it is something to watch out for, that code elsewhere doesn\u0027t assume that a LocalSurfaceId will only ever be associated with a single RenderWidget(Host).",

      "message": "The LocalSurfaceId must be allocated in the parent. I fixed this concern by resetting the frame rect and LocalSurfaceId until the parent allocates a new LocalSurfaceId. This will cause the child to defer commits until the parent resends frame rects. This works fine both today and with --enable-surface-synchronization.",
