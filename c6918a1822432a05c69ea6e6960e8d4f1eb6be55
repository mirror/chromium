I\u0027d prefer to be importing some python script.\n\nI found two I could use; one is depot_tool\u0027s download_from_google_storage, and one is //build/android/pylib/utils. Is there a preference for either? Should I bother using them?",

Perhaps we should consider moving/renaming google_storage_helper somewhere?",
