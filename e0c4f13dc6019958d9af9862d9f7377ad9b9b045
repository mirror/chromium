      "message": "Should we keep the bound_pixel_unpack_buffer.get() check? Otherwise if it\u0027s 0, we would be resetting GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH to the client state value, which we\u0027re not supposed to (since we handle them client-side in that case). See e.g. GLES2DecoderImpl::HandlePixelStorei\n\nNoting that non-0 bound_pixel_unpack_buffer.get() implies ES3, I think we don\u0027t need the feature_info_-\u003eIsWebGL2OrES3Context() check, so the previous code was complete I think.",
