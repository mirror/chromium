      "message": "If the new_rect is Contains() one of the highlighted_rects we don\u0027t need to push it at all. If it\u0027s overlapping, we only need to push the non-overlapping part?\n\nSo, could we change the above for() to have something like:\n\nfor(...) {\n  if (highlighted_rects[i]-\u003eContains(new_rect))\n    new_rect \u003d pp::Rect();\n  if (highlighted_rects[i]-\u003eIntersect(new_rect))\n    new_rect -\u003d highlighted_rects[i];  (Not sure if this does what I want, make new_rect\n                                        not contain the part covered by highlghted_rects)\n  if (new_rect.IsEmpty())\n    break;\n}\n\nif (!new_rect.IsEmpty())\n  highlighted_rects-\u003epush_back(new_rect)\n\n\nThat way, we only get non-overlapping rectangles in the array and we don\u0027t end up drawing the same pixels multiple times.",

      "message": "I\u0027m worried this is harder to actually do than expected. For one, if the top-right corner of a rect intersects the bottom-left corner of a rect already in |highlighted_rects|, then the non-overlapping part to add is actually 2 rects, since a rect can\u0027t represent a rectangle with its corner missing. There\u0027s no existing pp::Rect method to do that, BTW.\n\nA more complicated case would be when a large character appears in the middle of a paragraph of smaller characters. Now the new rect for that large character has to be shaved down into multiple smaller rects.",
