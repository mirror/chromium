      "message": "It\u0027s entirely possible I have this wrong. My understanding is that DidPresent/DidDiscard come in async so that it\u0027s possible to generate multiple CFs before we know if the present succeeded. Some logging I added on a device indicates multiple frames may in fact be requested before the ack (DidPresent/DidScard) is called. Because there is no ordering guarantee and I only care about success (DidPresent) I keep requesting times until a present and all the callbacks have been run.\n\nSo, this branch means we\u0027ve requested a time and either the frame(s) are still in flight, or the frame was discarded. In which case the request is made again in hopes of it being presented.",

      "message": "This lock shouldn\u0027t be necessary, sorry the code isn\u0027t super clear about that. When FinishCommitOnImplThread is called, the main thread is blocked (see the end ProxyMain::BeginMainFrame, we wait on a WaitableEvent while commit happens). That\u0027s why the rest of the commit doesn\u0027t use locks.\n\nThat should simplify a bit of the logic in DidPresentCompositorFrame too (no need to collect the callbacks to run outside the lock).",
