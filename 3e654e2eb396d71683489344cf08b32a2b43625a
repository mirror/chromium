      "message": "Could we make mojo/public/interfaces/bindings:bindings a component instead? That should also address this issue, right?\n\nI understand the current overridden_deps support is insufficient. But I hope we could limit the usage of overridden_deps to blink stuff and remove them eventually by splitting up the huge targets (such as blink platform) properly. Making it more powerful and using it in more places IMO is not the right direction.\n\nWDYT? Thanks!",

This stuff\u0027s still new to me so if I\u0027ve misunderstood what you meant let me know! I\u0027m happy to change the bindings target if that\u0027s the right thing to do :)",
