(Thanks for the code, btw).\n\n\u003e I think clang-cl.exe does still need -mssse3 right, even though cl.exe doesn\u0027t need (or have) any equivalent flag?\n\nYes, clang-cl.exe needs it.  cl.exe maybe doesn\u0027t need it, the bots will tell us I think, like do the win bots compile the adler_simd.c or some such. \n\n(normally robert.bradford@ would tell me, he is a master of these things, but is unavailable at this time).",

(Or might even be, the exact same speed as long as all 128 bits are in one 512-bit cache line?  Not sure.)  If the argument is not aligned, _mm_loadu_si128() will work and _mm_load_si128() will trap.\n\nNow, what I\u0027ve anecdotally found is beyond that, that we rarely notice a real-world difference between loading unaligned data with _mm_loadu_si128() directly and ramping into loading aligned data with either instruction.  Maybe it\u0027s prefetching helping us, or being compute limited anyway, or being big enough that we\u0027re waiting on memory... who knows.\n\nNo matter what you do here I\u0027m sure you\u0027re going to be speeding decoding up for machines with SSSE3.

The body cost equals the loop control cost.\n\n(Noted that clang adds some code straight after for the |len| is exactly divisible by 4 case.  That seems silly, the while (len \u003e\u003d4) { } loop before it already handled that!).\n\nFor the \"while (len \u003e\u003d 4) { .. }\" code we get:\n\n.LBB0_16:                               # \u003d\u003eThis Inner Loop Header: Depth\u003d1\n        movzbl  (%r10), %ecx\n        addl    %eax, %ecx\n        addl    %ecx, %edi\n        movzbl  1(%r10), %eax\n        addl    %ecx, %eax\n        addl    %eax, %edi\n        movzbl  2(%r10), %ecx\n        addl    %eax, %ecx\n        addl    %ecx, %edi\n        movzbl  3(%r10), %eax\n        addl    %ecx, %eax\n        addl    %eax, %edi\n        addq    $-4, %rdx\n        addq    $4, %r10\n        cmpq    $3, %rdx\n        ja      .LBB0_16\n\nAgain 4 inst. for the loop control, and 12 inst. to do \"s2 +\u003d (s1 +\u003d *buf++) 4 times, so loop overhead now 25%, much better.\n\nFor the \"while (len \u003e\u003d 16) { .. }\" code we get:\n  ...\n\n4 inst. for the loop control, and 3 x 16 inst. to do \"s2 +\u003d (s1 +\u003d *buf++) 16 times, loop overhead is smaller again, 8%.\n\nSeems to me that irrespective of compiler, alder32.c is using DO16 to amortize the significant cost of the loop overhead compared to the loop body.

The lengths we deal with are 0 ...31.\n\n\u003e I guess what I\u0027m wondering is, is Clang right to unroll 4x or are we right to unroll it 16x?\n\nTLDR: the later.\n\nIn the code we are looking at, the 16x unroll stuff, Clang is not exactly great. Clang adds the 4x unroll code you noted to it, but that code is never used.\n\nConsider in https://godbolt.org/g/HYhQGr \n\n    while (len \u003e\u003d 4) {\n        s2 +\u003d (s1 +\u003d *buf++);\n        s2 +\u003d (s1 +\u003d *buf++);\n        s2 +\u003d (s1 +\u003d *buf++);\n        s2 +\u003d (s1 +\u003d *buf++);\n        len -\u003d 4;\n    }\n\ntherefore, len \u003c\u003d 3 after this loop.  Clang needs to decide if it wants to do the next C code loop ...\n\n    while (len--) {\n        s2 +\u003d (s1 +\u003d *buf++);\n    }\n\nFor that they use:\n\n.LBB0_9:\n        leaq    -1(%rdx), %r8\n        movq    %rdx, %rcx\n        andq    $3, %rcx .      // and the len with 3\n        je      .LBB0_12        // if 0 results, go to \"fancy unroll pre-amble\"\n        negq    %rcx\n\nBut len \u003c\u003d 3 always here, right?  So the go to \"fancy unroll pre-amble\" is never taken for len\u003d1,2,3.  It can be taken for len \u003d 0 mind.\n\nThus, for len\u003d1,2,3, the while (len--) {} is done, and len \u003d -1 when complete. The code then enters the \"fancy unroll pre-amble\", with len \u003d -1 || 0 only.\n\n.LBB0_12:                   // \"fancy unroll preamble\"\n        cmpq    $3, %r8     // compare to len to 3\n        jb      .LBB0_14    // if below, go to the exit .LBB0_14\n                            // but len is either -1 or 0 here\n                            // below 3 is therefore always true\n                            // thus .LBB0_14 is always taken\n.LBB0_13: \n        \"fancy unroll\"\n        ...\n        ...\n.LBB0_14: \"clean-up\"\n        retq\n\nClang has added unrolled code at LBB0_13 that cannot be entered / used.  Not wrong, but not needed either, seems like a Clang bug.",
