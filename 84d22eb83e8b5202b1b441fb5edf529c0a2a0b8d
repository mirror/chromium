A layer can have opaque contents but also be drawn with some non-1 opacity.",

      "message": "I think WebLayer::SetOpaque is it.  It\u0027s an abstract function, so WebLayerImpl implements it too.  I think either means about the same thing.\n\nI was linking that to show you the only place that \"contents opaque is fixed\" is used, which is why I thought this comment should be \"SetOpaque\" and not \"SetOpacity\".",
