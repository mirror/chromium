A layer can have opaque contents but also be drawn with some non-1 opacity.",

I think either means about the same thing.\n\nI was linking that to show you the only place that \"contents opaque is fixed\" is used, which is why I thought this comment should be \"SetOpaque\" and not \"SetOpacity\".",
