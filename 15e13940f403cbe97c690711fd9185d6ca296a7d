      "message": "sorry to be confusing, in this case you can construct it like std::string(foo) instead of static cast. Specifically: \"Do not use cast formats like int y \u003d (int)x or int y \u003d int(x) (but the latter is okay when invoking a constructor of a class type).\"\n\nfwiw string\u0027s operator+ creates/destroys a bunch of temporary strings, so I think it\u0027s usually something to avoid, and you could use append instead. this isn\u0027t exactly perf critical code, but something to think about anyway.",

      "message": "you can remove the DebugRect() part with emplace_back. Think of emplace as the constructor, it takes the constructor arguments and forwards them along. If you build a DebugRect, then you call the copy/move constructor, which is the same as what push_back did. Instead you can call the constructing(?) constructor, by just passing the arguments it would receive.",
