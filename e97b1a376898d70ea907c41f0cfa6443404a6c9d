      "message": "Here is a thought. Could we set the cs we want on the target_pixmap? I think if you always remove the cs on the info we give to PaintImage::Decode and pass the cs in target_pixmap in that method, it should all work. If the target_cs matches the image, it will become a no-op during the decode step. That\u0027s what sw does, if I\u0027m reading it right: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/tiles/software_image_decode_cache_utils.cc?sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d74",
