      "message": "Here is a thought. Could we set the cs we want on the target_pixmap? I think if you always remove the cs on the info we give to PaintImage::Decode and pass the cs in target_pixmap in that method, it should all work. If the target_cs matches the image, it will become a no-op during the decode step.
