      "message": "The UMA_STATUS_AREA_* metrics naming seems to be used only for the system tray (quick settings). I think UMA_TRAY_* would be a more appropriate naming here. (Admittedly though any naming we choose isn\u0027t going to be perfect, since terminology isn\u0027t 100% consistent throughout Ash UI code and documentation.)\n\nI think it would be a bit more clear what the metrics actually meaure if we used the words \"successful\" and \"unsuccessful\". So here is what I would propose for naming:\n\nUMA_TRAY_SWIPE_TO_OPEN_SUCCESSFUL\nUMA_TRAY_SWIPE_TO_OPEN_UNSUCCESSFUL\nUMA_TRAY_SWIPE_TO_CLOSE_SUCCESSFUL\nUMA_TRAY_SWIPE_TO_CLOSE_UNSUCCESSFUL\n\nPlease be sure to re-name the \"StatusArea_*\" strings accordingly.",
