      "message": "nit: exo doesn\u0027t really have any existing use of weak ptrs because we typically have observer classes for most objects. I prefer if we do the same in this case for two reasons:\n\n1. it\u0027s consistent with rest of exo\n2. observer interfaces are a bit more explicit and less confusing when using multiple threads\n\nLet\u0027s add a data_buffer_observer.h file with a DataOfferObserver class and move DataOfferDelegate::OnDataOfferDestroying to that interface. Wdyt?",
