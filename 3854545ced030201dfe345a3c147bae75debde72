The cargo-culting was to ensure that layout tests cover similar behavior to what //chrome layer does.  And after this CL, this will still hold true (//chrome layer creates new WebContents with effectively a nullptr site instance, unless an opener is present [and unless tab_util::GetSiteInstanceForNewTab does something special for WebUI and/or extensions])",
