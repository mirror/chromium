      "message": "This is because we now start coverage before we load the script, so we end up with precise block-level coverage. The used size for this file was already 354 for similar scenario in other tests, and the difference, I think, is in the whitespace within the outer function. I somehow did not manage to get \"best effort\" coverage that we previously were showing in this test -- I can get function-level, but it\u0027s not the same. I think this one is good enough and actually less dependent on races against JS GC than the one we were previously showing.",
