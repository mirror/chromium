      "message": "So high level what was going on is ReleaseCallback was a typedef to specify the arguments. But it\u0027s always called only once, so we wrapped it in SingleReleaseCallback to make 2 types.\n\nI think ReleaseCallback should be a OnceCallback now. And if that worked, we can probably remove the type and only use SingleReleaseCallback.\n\nDo you wanna make ReleaseCallback a OnceCallback first and then see where that takes us?",
