      "message": "So, on seeing this, I looked a bit more at the implementation here, how it uses threading, and how we could get into this scenario. I think this is very badly broken w/ multiple devices, as all device executors share a single test instance and thus a single deobfuscator. I\u0027m wondering about ways to either have dedicated threads \u0026 processes per call to TransformLines, pools of each used for TransformLines, or separate deobfuscators for each device.",
