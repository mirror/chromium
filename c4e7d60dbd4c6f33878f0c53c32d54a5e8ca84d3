      "message": "hm, why does this need to be scaled by DSF? GetHitTestMask and state_.input_region should always be in DP but I guess the |scale_| APi we added for Arc changes that. Are you sure it\u0027s not |scale_| that we need to take into account here?",

      "message": "I tried to place a portrait ARC window at the top right of screen on caroline (device_scale_factor\u003d2, scale_\u003d1). The window bounds look like:\n\nExoShellSurface (0, 0, 309, 549)\n+ ExoShellSurfaceHost\n + ExoSurface (0, 0, 2400, 1600)\n\nThe size of ExoShellSurface looks like the window size in DP.\nThe size of ExoSurface looks like the screen size in physical pixel.\n\nAlso state_.input_region of ExoSurface looks to use coordinate of physical pixel, not DP. So I thought we need to change the coordinate system when passing a mask from ExoSurface -\u003e ExoShellSurface.\n\nFor scale_ we probably need to take scale_ into account as well as DSF. But even if scale_ is 1, it looks there is some mismatch between ExoShellSurface and ExoSurface coordinate systems.",
