      "message": "This is fine for 63. I worry, though, that it\u0027s going to hide failures in subresources/widgets from developers. Like, say Disqus was using these kinds of certs; it would be unfortunate if developers only found out there was a problem when they visited `disqus.com`, which I imagine no one does. :)\n\nThat\u0027s an argument for a more robust implementation as part of the security panel or something (as I can imagine that this isn\u0027t the last time we\u0027ll be warning about this kind of thing), but it\u0027s not a reason to skip this short-term solution.",
