      "message": "This code is tricky. Is there some way to unify these codepaths at the cost of branches? For example, always use the width\u003d\u003d3 path and then have special logic to skip some of the steps in there?\n\nMostly looking to de-dupe this logic into a single function.",

      "message": "So we could go back to the patch set 6 version but make the new function anonymous. That I think minimizes code and gets everything in one function with the ability to isolate each case in a block per case.\n\nThe other way to minimize code is to have a big table of parameters indexed by width and (length % 12) and use just one function, but that kind of hides the behavior in a big table of numbers and does a lot of extra computation on the simple cases. Note it\u0027s mod 12 because that the smallest common multiple of 2, 4, and 6.\n\nOr we can hide it from GraphicContext and stick it into it\u0027s own file.\n\nOr we can bunch the cases into \"drop one pixel from start gap\" and \"drop one pixel from start and end gaps\" etc which re-uses a bit of code and may make it more readable because the magic numbers will become explicit functions of the width. I\u0027ll see what that one looks like.",
