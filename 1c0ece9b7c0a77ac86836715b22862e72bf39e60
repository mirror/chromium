      "message": "Should this come first? The comment suggests it includes things like the file manager and the ChromeOS settings-in-a-window Window (which shouldn\u0027t show a title still?).\n\nAlso it\u0027s not obvious why we can\u0027t just fall through -- shouldn\u0027t hosted app browser windows still support FEATURE_TITLEBAR? (seems it\u0027s just !tabbed)  Are we setting is_trusted_source for hosted/bookmark apps? (that seems wrong).",

I think this is as opposed to popup windows?\n\nTrusted windows get restored, and get packaged app style headers when they\u0027re not apps. I really don\u0027t understand what things are and aren\u0027t trusted sources beyond popups \u003d no, apps/devtools \u003d yes.",
