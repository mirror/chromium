      "message": "Hmmm... I mainly wanted to reduce the start size (just figured 16MB was also too high for the max size). Do you think I should just leave it as-is? Do you happen to know which GL commands may fail? I saw the TexImage2D usage, but it looked like a small transfer buffer just resulted in TexSubImage2D fallback.",
