That would enable you to remove a couple layers of indirection and avoid the new member in the browser process.",

I think something still has to live in the browser process (either the policy or this service) for the consumers to register listeners on directly (I guess consumers could technically listen to all sources for the one notification but that doesn\u0027t seem right).",
