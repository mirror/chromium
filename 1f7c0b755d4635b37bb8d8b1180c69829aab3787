The issue we were concerned about was that maybe the call to Show/Hide (which will lead to calling SetVisibilityForChildViews on current_frame_host() for the node associated with the speculative frame) might make the frame tree of a nested OOPIF incorrectly hidden.\n\nHowever, I just noticed that |frame_connector_| for the view of the speculative frame is nullptr until we call CommitPending(). That being said, there should not be a risk of propagating the visibility down the frame tree through the speculative frame.\n\nI also added some comments that RenderFrameHostImpl::SetVisibitilityForChildViews should not be called on a speculative or pending frame.",
