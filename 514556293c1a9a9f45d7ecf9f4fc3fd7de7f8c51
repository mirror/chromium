      "message": "Hmm, I thought we used it for chrome:// schemes at least. There\u0027s an explicit SchemeIsHTTPOrHTTPS method in GURL which suggests that GURL itself should not care, at least for parsing a URL? I can understand that we may not be able to use it at a higher level, but it would be nice not to replicate the parsing code. That said, this is definitely an improvement and seems fine.",
