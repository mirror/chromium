      "message": "Hmm, I thought we used it for chrome:// schemes at least. There\u0027s an explicit SchemeIsHTTPOrHTTPS method in GURL which suggests that GURL itself should not care, at least for parsing a URL? I can understand that we may not be able to use it at a higher level, but it would be nice not to replicate the parsing code. That said, this is definitely an improvement and seems fine.",

While I\u0027d like to use GURL, I\u0027m hesitant to patch it to support our use case.
