      "message": "Oops, sorry I should have noticed this earlier than I commented about use of raw_headers.\n\nThe original test is checking that entries in the Access-Control-Request-Headers header in a preflight are lower cased. So, here you need to extract the header and split the value at comma characters and verify that one of them is \"x-test\" (lower cased). You don\u0027t need raw_headers from the beginning as the value you need to check is in the value part, not the key.",
