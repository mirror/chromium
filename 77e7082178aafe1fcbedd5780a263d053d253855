Maybe we could call this something else that better describes the third possibility?\n\n(Also, a minor terminology nit: I would traditionally think of this as more of something named \u0027enum Type\u0027 rather than \u0027enum Id\u0027: to me, they indicate slightly different things. But I guess it might be annoying to change that, and maybe that\u0027s how the rest of cast / media router code treats this)",
