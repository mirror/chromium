      "message": "I\u0027m still confused why you need to remove the fullscreen restriction given that this old call should go to RenderViewHostImpl::RenderWidgetGotFocus -\u003e WebContentsView(Aura|Mac)::GotFocus() -\u003e WebContentsImpl::NotifyWebContentsFocused() and fire OnWebContentsFocused for the non-fullscreen case.  Or is the issue that this does not work with Android because WebContentsViewAndroid::GotFocus didn\u0027t do anything, but then why not just fix that function?\n\nMy concern is that on non-Android platforms, we might now end up firing OnWebContentsFocused twice: once through owner_delegate_-\u003eRenderWidgetGotFocus() and once through delegate_-\u003eRenderWidgetGotFocus() below.  Am I misunderstanding how this works?  It seems if we remove the fullscreen restriction in WebContentsImpl::RenderWidgetGotFocus, we should also remove owner_delegate_-\u003eRenderWidgetGotFocus(), which is now doing the same thing as below IIUC.",
