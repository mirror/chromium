      "message": "This method is to get the total number of decoded video bytes from media pipeline. It seems that it has nothing to do with seeking. There is a logic in RendererController to avoid using any result obtained before seeking in the content bitrate estimation if seeking happens during the estimation. But I don\u0027t feel properly to add such comment here. WDYT?",

      "message": "Even better than a boolean, let\u0027s record the media bitrate and the estimated capacity in the UMAs. This would be very useful data.\n\nHmm...What we\u0027d really like is a 2-dimensional histogram, but I don\u0027t think we can do that with the UMA infrastructure. Meaning, the buckets would be in 2D space: One dimension would be the media bitrate, the other dimension would be the estimated capacity.\n\nMaybe the UMA buckets could just record the fractional difference: required bitrate divided by estimated capacity? But, then we lose some critical information...\n\nI\u0027m not sure what to do here...This needs some thought and investigation.",
