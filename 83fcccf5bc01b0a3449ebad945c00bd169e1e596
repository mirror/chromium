      "message": "This language may specify more strictly than what implementations do. For ContextGL I guess I would say this can\u0027t be called if BindToCurrentThread() did not succeed first, and is not null if the ContextProvider was created for GL use?\n\nI find a lot of \"just in case\" nullchecks of this method in blink and remove them, and would try not to encourage more. The way this reads you need to check if GLES2 is supported or not, but you should know already when you created it?",
