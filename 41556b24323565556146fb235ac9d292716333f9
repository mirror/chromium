Do you constantly switch between system and shelf?\n\nWouldn\u0027t it be better to use all views as one big alt tab cycler ring?",

And it\u0027s true that if using reverse tabbing multiple times, the focus will eventually go back to the system tray.\n\nI think in order to have a cycler ring, all views should be a subclass of AccessiblePaneView?\n But the lock screen related views (|WebUILoginView| and |LockContentsView|) are not. In addition, this code needs to work with Web-UI login screen (|WebUILoginView| is notified by calling |NotifyFocusOut| in line 139), it cannot form a cycler ring.\n\nBy the way, the comments in line 138 will be changed because this code should not assume the observers are login/lock screen.",
