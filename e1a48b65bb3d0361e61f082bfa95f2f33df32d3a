      "message": "The description of this histogram says, \"Time spent in Clear Browsing Data dialog. From opening the dialog until data is cleared. This does not record users who exit the dialog without clearing.\", but it looks like this time is recorded when the clearing is kicked off (rather than when the data is cleared). Consider changing where the time is recorded or change the description (so they match, either way).\n\nIts also odd that this has a \"History.\" prefix and being recorded from settings. Please make a note that this is also called for clearing in settings in the histogram description; or change the histogram name; or make a separate histogram for settings (i.e. have the labels/descriptions line up).",
