      "message": "I\u0027m concerned about whether this is theoretically correct (though I imagine it\u0027s fine in practice).\n\nI thought the \"sources\" list was supposed to reflect all the input files for which changes could cause differing output on a rebuild.  Let\u0027s say one of these scripts is involved in a build step.  Shouldn\u0027t it then be in the sources list, since a change to the script ought to necessitate a rebuild?\n\nOr are \"sources\" supposed to be source code files only, and not other auxiliary files?  In which case maybe this should be a whitelist of extensions instead of a blacklist?",
