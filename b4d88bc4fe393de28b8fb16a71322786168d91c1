      "message": "This seems problematic to me.  content:content_implementation has a comment that it\u0027s \"Applied by targets internal to content\", but this is adding it to content/test:test_support, which is used all over the place, so I\u0027m concerned this gives tests outside of content ability to use content-internal APIs.  It also seems like it causes link problems - see the current compile failures on win_chromium_compile_dbg_ng, for example.\n\nA strawman idea is to add a GetContentClientForTesting() which isn\u0027t guarded by CONTENT_IMPLEMENTATION, but that feels like it\u0027s overkill for what you\u0027re trying to do here, so I\u0027d also try to avoid that.  The GetContentClient() call site feels a bit random from outside content anyhow.\n\nWould it work to add a SetBrowserStartupIsCompleteForTesting() somewhere in content/, which you call from CreateThreads, and content::SetBrowserStartupIsCompleteForTesting() then internally calls GetContentClient()-\u003eSetBrowserStartupIsCompleteForTesting()?",
