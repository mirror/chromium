      "message": "I like the idea of sending the current connection type upon registration but I think we need to adjust it in a couple ways:\n1. I think it needs to be sent via a different signal than OnNetworkChanged() as this could incorrectly trigger observers to think the network has actually changed.  This sending of the signal back is also racing observers registering which could lead to various problems.  Perhaps adding a OnInitialNetworkType signal could solve this.\n2. We\u0027ll still need NetworkConnectionTracker::GetConnectionType() to block until the OnInitialNetworkType() signal is received.\n\nCould we make the current network type a return value of some operation, either RequestNotifications() or GetNetworkChangeManager()?  This would eliminate the need for the OnInitialNetworkType() signal.",
