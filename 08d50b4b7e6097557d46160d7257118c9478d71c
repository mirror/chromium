If GetConnectionType() wins the race it gets an incorrect connection status.\n\n\u003e  \n\u003e \u003e 2.

Making it an async interface would fix this issue, but would require modifications to users of the interface.  Looks like there are 28 references to NCN::GetConnectionType (ignoring test and net/ references).",
