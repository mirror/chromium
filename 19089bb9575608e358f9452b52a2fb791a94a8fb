      "message": "Hmm, I am a little wary of defining a different interface which looks just like the existing Geolocation interface. Perhaps we could instead expect clients to acquire the IP-based Geolocation interface from a different provider (i.e. not GeolocationService).\n\n  interface PublicIpGeolocationProvider {\n    GetGeolocation(Geolocation\u0026 request);\n  };\n\nThat way we can still hide PublicIpGeolocationProvider behind its own special manifest capability (encouraging more careful review), but general-purpose client code doesn\u0027t need to change based on what type of Geolocation impl is on the other end. WDYT?",
