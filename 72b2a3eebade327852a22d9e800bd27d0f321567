      "message": "It looks like this app can only handle a single in-flight request at a time.  Is that an intentional limitation?  If so, we should document that in the header somewhere.\n\nRight now it looks like weird things will happen if the app somehow triggers more than one request at a time.  Should there be DCHECKs to try and catch that?",
