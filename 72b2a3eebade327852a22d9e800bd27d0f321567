      "message": "Ack. \n\nTo also explain a little more of my thought process I was hoping to make the least intrusive change as I could while also putting my changes in the appropriate context. For example AppStartupParameters is specifically for parameters received from outside apps at startup so I figured that I would need to put any flags and extra parameters there. This function seemed to be about evaluating launch parameters when deciding to open a tab, which is why I thought this logic might make sense to live here. However the problem I ran into is that UserActivityHandler and URLOpener always attempt to open a new tab when we handle startup information so I thought it might be beneficial to introduce a new tab opener function that lets us know if we should stay on the tab based on startup information.",

I can also add a similar check to ReceiveResponseFromIOSPaymentInstrument such that if the delegate is null we cancel the request to receive the response. On your point about raw pointers that\u0027s a good point. If the user closes the tab that will cancel the current PaymentRequest which owns the PaymentInstrument delegate used here meaning this pointer would have garbage value. I don\u0027t know if owning the delegate instead would make more sense, but perhaps my suggestion from earlier could work? Making sure the delegate is non-null before making the call to ReceieveResponseFromIOSPaymentInstrument. In fact we could make this check in main_controller.mm when we call shouldStayOnTab and if the delegate is null we can return NO. What do you think?",
