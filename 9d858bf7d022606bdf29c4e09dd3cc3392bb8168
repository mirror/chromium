      "message": "InstallableCallback is referenced in both task_queue.h and installable_manager.h (prior to this CL, it lived in installable_manager.h along with everything else).  I put it in installable_data.h so that it would be available to both task_queue.h and installable_manager.h, which both include installable_data.h.\n\nI looks like it would everything would still function if I removed it from task_queue.h and duplicated it in each of task_queue.h and installable_manager.h, but I thought it better to have it defined in only one place. This type of using directive is new to me though, so I don\u0027t know what the conventional usage is.",
