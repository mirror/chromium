      "message": "Oh yeah... I looked for that opportunity, but somehow I missed it. \n\nThanks !\n\nRe: alphabeticizing in terms of the destination letters: I thought about that, too, when making a cl for crbug.com/793628 . I didn\u0027t do that because I was scanning the Unicode code chart for source characters that look like ASCII Latin. Now that I\u0027m done with that (I hope), it may be time to do that. \n\nArgh, I grouped 4-5 destination letters in the current order when making test domains and unit test entries. If I change the order here, I\u0027d better change the order in unit test as well. That I can do.  Then, I realized that the source code order makes it easy to separate Latin from non-Latin.  Well, it\u0027s not a big deal, but I\u0027ll just leave it alone....",
