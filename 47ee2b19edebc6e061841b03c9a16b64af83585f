      "message": "The reason the callback is on the heap is because we release() it when we issue the JNI call and re-retain it when we get our response. I am unsure of how to do that if we\u0027re passing the callback around by value, since our ownership model breaks down a bit while we\u0027re on the Java side.\n\nWe could probably have some sort of proxy object own the callback, but it too would have some weird lifetime management.",
