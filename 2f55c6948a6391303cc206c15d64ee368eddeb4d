      "message": "I assume this bug is happening in the cache hit case? If so, how should this new logic behave when a non-UACSS image is requested and reused by a UACSS stylesheet (or vice versa)? That Resource will now be flagged as UACSS in all cases, even after the last UACSS usage is unregistered.",

      "message": "This is related to resource leak detection. Since the UA stylesheets are kept around permanently in the renderer process any images used by those stylesheets will result in an incorrectly identified \"leak\" since they stay around after user navigation.\n\nThe UA stylesheets always hold onto an ImageResource and are not deleted so it is probably of no use to track UA CSS usage.",
