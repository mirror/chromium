      "message": "Some code bases use the terms loosely, it\u0027s true. But mock does have a specific definition. A mock object allows well-defined expectations about what calls will or won\u0027t be made. For example, in my test, I had Times(1) which would fail if the hint was sent more than once but the fake wouldn\u0027t notice or care. It\u0027s not especially important here, but it can be.\n\nhttps://big.corp.google.com/~jmcmaster/testing/2013/08/episode-296-know-your-test-doubles.html has a nice explainer.",
