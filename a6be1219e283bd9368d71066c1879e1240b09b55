      "message": "\u003e nit: add a comment; can other platforms do something smarter here?\n\nComment Done.\n\nI think other platforms _can_ do something smarter, but it involves `FaceCache` not just caching hb_face_t, but the full hb_font_t. But this is actually what WebKit/Source/platform/fonts/shaping/HarfBuzzFace.cpp does already\n\nThat\u0027s this thing: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/platform/fonts/shaping/HarfBuzzFontCache.h?q\u003dHbFontCacheEntry\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d119\n\n(but it has a TODO to cache the size-independent hb_*face*_t (not hb_font_t) arrrgghhh. It\u0027s a mess. I think that TODO is actually not TODOable any more, since it would inflict Blink on Mac with this same performance regression we got in UI).\n\nAnyway.... Really we need to delete harfbuzz_font_skia.cc completely and move HarfBuzzFontCache.h and HarfBuzzFace.cpp out of third_party/WebKit and into somewhere that can be shared. I\u0027m thinking src/text (:o). Since I\u0027m pretty sure blink doesn\u0027t want to depend on src/ui.\n\nAlso that means settling on a common font description, adapting gfx::Font to use it, pulling in the FontCache (which has a text run cache too! woohoo). It\u0027s Epic. But it needs to be done -- we can\u0027t have two different harfbuzz \"glue\" frameworks since they are drifting apart: the one in blink is getting updated, but this one in ui/gfx is rotting and the Unicode standard is not stationary.",

HarfBuzzFontCache.h has only existed since July (r484122). A-ha!

      "message": "\u003e Is this needed for views tests? Maybe comment as to why\n\nHmm. views_unittests does it. It was added for views_unittests in r482704 \"ensures ui::InitializeContextFactoryForTests() initializes HostFrameSinkManager. This uses Mojo so it requires that test targets initialize mojo::edk\"\n\nHostFrameSinkManager looks as though it\u0027s needed to interact with the compositor.\n\nviews::ViewsTestBase will call ui::InitializeContextFactoryForTests() when its views::ScopedViewsTestHelper initializes a views::PlatformTestHelper, so I think we do want this to be consistent and so we can test drawing performance.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what to comment though. HostFrameSinkManager wants this call to Init() now, but there could be lots of things wanting it in future.\n\nThe current perf test does pass without this line. So, I\u0027m happy to remove it, but I feel like it would be an obscure thing to discover/troubleshoot when someone adds a test that happens to tickle enough of the compositor. wdyt?",
