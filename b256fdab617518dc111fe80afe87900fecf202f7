      "message": "Renaming to something more obviously not-for-general-use SGTM. That said, the aim is to create the minimum dependencies to get GN\u0027s implicit \"all\" target to work, so \"gn_all\" isn\u0027t the dumbest name in the world. Perhaps something like \"gn_all_helper\" or \"all_helper\" or \"all_dependencies\" or \"gn_dependencies\", though?\n\nAlso, note that \"gn_all\" gets a mention in various BUILD.gn and README comments under //ios, though it seems those comments are on group(\"all\") targets - I\u0027m not actually sure what the GN semantics are for \"all\" when a BUILD.gn already has an explicit \"all\" target. Should we update the comments? I couldn\u0027t find a JSON for those bots - the chromium.mac.json seems to be just Mac desktop?\n\nWe also have an explicit \"gn_all\" target in //v8, which the root BUILD.gn depends on; it in turn depends on d8, fuzzers, parser shell, and test \u0026 tools gn_all targets.",
