      "message": "This is definitely a little awkward to have this function implemented here.  You\u0027re already storing the font name and size on the PaintTypeface.  Can you make this a different function, like CreateSkTypefaceFromNSFont or something, and then not have CreateSkTypeface have different parameters based on #ifdefs or have multiple implementations.  Just a single #ifdef in the CreateSkTypeface function itself?",
