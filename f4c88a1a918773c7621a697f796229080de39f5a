      "message": "I don\u0027t think any of these belong here. The only one used outside of page_info_bubble_view.cc is the VIEW_ID_PAGE_INFO_LINK_SITE_SETTINGS, used to get the button for testing. I suggest adding a GetSiteSettings[Link|Button|View]() to the PageInfoBubbleViewTestApi or adding a similar *ForTesting() method on the class itself to obviate that need. Alternately, if the values will be more widely needed, I suggest declaring an enum class in PageInfoBubbleView, since these are unlikely to clash with uses of other browser-wide view ids. Let\u0027s favor better encapsulation in this case.",
