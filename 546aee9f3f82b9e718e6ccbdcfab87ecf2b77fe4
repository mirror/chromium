      "message": "Frankly, I\u0027m not too happy with this. It\u0027s 8 lines to call a method that returns a bool. The need for CaptureNext\u003c\u003e specialization really hurts the readability of the call itself. I tried a \"using\" declaration in the next file, which helps a little but is still very verbose.\n\nDo you think this is better, or do you think I should stick with the version in patchset 1 that only works for non-ref types?  Any other ideas?",
