      "message": "(optional): WDYT to rebase this on top of https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/785434?\n\nThen;\n- Arg counting is no longer needed. Mojo does not allow method overloading, so once the CL is\nlanded, what we need to see is if there is Init() or not.\n- It also means, we can remove one CallInstanceInit at L173, now.\n\nI\u0027m also ok to move forward with this now, and clean up later.",

Overall I prefer your approach in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/785750, so you can think of this as temporary scaffolding to allow us to land stuff whenever.",
