      "message": "How long does this test take to run?\n\nI\u0027m concerned that it\u0027s a stress test, running in a functional suite. Though it is still important to do.\n\nWhat is the failure case of this test? If it\u0027s choking on something due to performance, I imagine it could fail in a few ways, or even pass when it *should* fail?\n\nI\u0027d also be concerned if the EarlGrey actions don\u0027t perfectly correlate to user actions (i.e. maybe EG does better than user actions, masking the problem, or vice versa and we get test failures that don\u0027t map to a product problem).",

      "message": "I\u0027m concerned that this test won\u0027t be very effective for this reason. Let\u0027s say there is a regression in the table code or data source that causes the scrolling to be slow enough to start timing out (and appear flaky). The kneejerk reaction will be to increase the timeout because \"scrolling is slow\" and the actual regression never gets fixed.\n\nHow can we make this better?",
