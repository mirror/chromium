It\u0027s awkward that we can\u0027t really mention them directly here, but it\u0027s covered by the CrossOriginXHR.ContentScript browser_test.  (Also http/tests/xmlhttprequest/origin-whitelisting-*.html, but those tests will require some more test plumbing to fix and are disabled in --site-per-process for now.)",
