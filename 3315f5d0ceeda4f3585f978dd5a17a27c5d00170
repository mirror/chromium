I\u0027m OK having you as an owner. I don\u0027t see sammc making any commits to this code, but given I\u0027m ok making you an owner if you want to make him an owner that is your decision.",

No harm in applying those rules everywhere IMHO.\n\nsammc@ has done a bunch of work on Web Share and has reviewed almost all the rest. Less so on the views side but I\u0027m happy to have him as an owner there.",
