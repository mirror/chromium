It looks scary but IMHO it\u0027s a bit more reliable as it\u0027s based all on plumbing commands and does not require git to generate and reapply any diff.\n\n1. Generate the commit message:\ngit log --format\u003d%B --reverse $TRACKING_BRANCH..$CUR_BRANCH \u003e tmp_file_for_commit_message\n\n2. Get the tree-ish for the current commit:\nCUR_TREE :\u003d git log --pretty\u003dformat:\u0027%T\u0027 -n1 $CUR_BRANCH\n\n3. Create the one commit:\nNEW_COMMIT_SHA1 :\u003d git commit-tree $CUR_TREE -p $tracking_branch -F tmp_file_for_commit_message\n\nthis will return the SHA1 of the new commit object, which has the same tree of the old one, but is reparented directly to origin/master (or whatever tracking branch).\n\n4. At this point, update the branch:\n\ngit update-ref refs/heads/$CUR_BRANCH $NEW_COMMIT_SHA1\nNote: if you used --symbolic-full-name  above this $CUR_BRANCH_NAME will already have the \"refs/heads/\" prefix\n\n5. Sanity check that git rev-list --count $TRACKING_BRANCH..$CUR_BRANCH \u003d\u003d 1\n\n\nOn top of this, you could probably do this in a separate temporary branch and rename it at the end, so that if something goes wrong, you won\u0027t live the user with a screwed up branch.",
