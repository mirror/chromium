I am a little ambivalent about that in general (since I am prone to mistakes doing this sort of thing), but seems to have a high upside when working with enums.xml.\n\nOh, huh, on that note CHECK_EOF_RESULT_KEY_SHA256_MISMATCH seems to be missing there and is unused in the code. Not sure what\u0027s the proper thing to do here, since I don\u0027t know what implications of reducing _MAX are. \n\nAnyway, whatever happens with that can be a separate CL.",
