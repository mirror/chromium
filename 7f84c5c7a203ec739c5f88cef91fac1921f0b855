      "message": "I would not have expected TLS 1.3 variants to kick in in these tests. They\u0027re still running at max version TLS 1.2, no?\n\nRather the issue is that https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/23264 caused a regression. It lost the max_version check in minting the session ID. We need to fix that and get a roll in first. When we turn off TLS 1.3 via field trials, it needs to actually get turned off.",
