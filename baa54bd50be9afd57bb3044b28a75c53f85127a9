      "message": "I\u0027m not sure this is right. All the class intializers DCHECK(parentWindow) - a BaseBubbleController should be allowed to assume it always has a non-nil parent window.\n\nIs something is calling [BaseBubbleController setParentWindow:nil] at some point? I think that\u0027s the \"bad actor\" that needs its behaviour modified.\n\nWe should also add a test, e.g. to ensure nothing regresses with --secondary-ui-md. If the failure happens (without the fix) using ui::test::ScopedFakeNSWindowFullscreen then it should work find in a browser test.\n\n(also this will probably need a merge, and lots will complain if you try to merge regression fixes without tests!)",
