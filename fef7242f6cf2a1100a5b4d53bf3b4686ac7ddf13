Now that we\u0027re not using 9-patches, we should clean up TimedItem/DateDividedAdapter to remove the un-used methods and logic.\n\nThis CL where I added list item shadows and width constrained styling is a good reference for this that can be dropped or need to be modified in this visual refresh: https://codereview.chromium.org/2654193002",

      "message": "This method and the one below were used to resize items that use list_item_*.9.png as backgrounds. They work in conjunction with a MarginResizer, which adjusts layout when the width changes. \n\nThese need to be updated now that the list items are no longer using 9-patches as backgrounds. To test out that the items are displayed correctly in narrow and wide views, you just need a device with a width \u003c 600dp (all phones in portrait mode) and a device with a width \u003e 600dp (all tablets and many phones in landscape).",
