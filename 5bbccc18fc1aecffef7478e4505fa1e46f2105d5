L291 depends on properties, obtained from L281, which is created by AddService at L274. So, anyway it looks to need call AddEntry twice.\n\nPlease let me know, if we should fix fake side, instead.",

      "message": "Ah, I didn\u0027t notice the profile lookup in SetServiceProperties).\n\nIt sounds like ProfileClient::AddEntry should *probably* also set kProfileProperty in |properties|, but it is possible that will break something else. An alternative would be to add a test interface method \u0027AddServiceToProfile\u0027.\n\nIf fixing that is straightforward and works, great. If not, just clarify the comment a bit, thanks!",

      "message": "Thank you for explanation!\n\nI\u0027ve re-read the code, and found that FakeShillProfileClient::AddService() may be the one we need?\nHowever, it prohibits to add one service to multiple profiles:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chromeos/dbus/fake_shill_profile_client.cc?sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d211\n\nAnd then I\u0027m slightly confused, so I need more your advice.\n\nQuestion: what is the expected relationship between shill profile and service, in real implementation?\nCan a service have relationship to multiple profiles at once?\n- If so, should we make some change for FakeShillProfileClient::AddService and its deferred methods?\n- If not, what\u0027s the goal of RemoveConfiguration, which removes the specified service from \"all\" profiles, but conceptually it should be tied to at most one profile?\n\nNote that, technically we can workaround by the combination of AddEntry and AddService, but I think it\u0027s better if we can make \"fake\" situation closer to the real one.",
