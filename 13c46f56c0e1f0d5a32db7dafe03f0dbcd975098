      "message": "While preparing passwords is asynchronous, querying the stored passwords seems not. Not sure for what else we need the asynchronous processing? Could we just replace PreparePasswordsForExport with PreparePasswordsForExportInternal (and remove |abort_|)?\n\nI realise that the design doc might be confusing in this. It works with the assumption that the stored passwords need to be retrieved, but we are using the cached value which is already displayed. So there is no source of asynchronous processing or waiting other than writing.\n\nThis would be different if we planned to support exporting during the loading of the settings page, but I don\u0027t think we should do that.",

Or is the PasswordManagerExporter reused between two occasions of pressing the Export button? In that case we could explain it in comments here, but at the same time I would be worried about how the exporter updates the list of saved passwords between the two export actions.\n\n(My concern is the same with the next test as well.)",
