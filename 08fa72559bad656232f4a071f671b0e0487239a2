It\u0027s unclear how I can use an error level of console messages for deprecation. One solution would be to check if we already registered the count but these methods are \"only for tests\". Is there a solution I missed?",

      "message": "Well I\u0027m pretty sure the devtools team won\u0027t want you using an \u0027Error\u0027 level for this anyway - they have a real problem with developers complaining about error-spam (see the new features for filtering/grouping of messages), and so I believe errors are really supposed to be reserved for things that HAVE broken.  We can ask someone in devtools though if you feel strongly it should be an error.  Also I believe kJSMessageSource is supposed to be reserved for things that are generated directly by JavaScript, which this isn\u0027t.  Off the top of my head I don\u0027t see anything better than kDeperecationMessageSource, kOtherMessageSource or maybe kRecommendationMessageSource.\n\nSo I think a custom \u0027deprecation\u0027 warning is as good as anything else (just using your own string to avoid words like \"deprecated\").  Here\u0027s a key question: when we ship ReportingAPI and we\u0027ve got some analytics providers generating reports showing developers what breaking changes they may be hitting - do you want this message to be included?  If so, you\u0027ll get that for free by calling this a \"deprecation\" (or \"intervention - but that is even less applicable).  In a way I think you can think of it as something we shipped via a blog and then deprecated and removed before it ever made it into an official Chrome build.\n\nBut I\u0027m also fine with you outputting a custom warning from kOtherMessageSource yourself.  To avoid triggering more than once per document you could just stash a bit somewhere associated with the Document (or FrameHost) to track that the message has been generated already.  Or just following the pattern in Deprecation.cpp (accessing UseCounter::HasRecordedMeasurement) seems fine to me - I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a very strong reason to say that that is for testing only (obviously Deprecation.cpp uses it outside testing).",

      "message": "(FWIW, the \"only for tests\" are the `IsCounted` methods... not sure why they are for tests while `HasMeasurement` isn\u0027t... thanks for the pointer!)\n\nThanks for the thorough reply. I hear the argument about not using errors. I will follow the advice even if I\u0027m worried it will make this less effective.\n\nRegarding using the Deprecation code, there is still the issue of it being prefixed with \"Deprecation\" (I guess coming from the type?). I\u0027m afraid it will lead to confusions as a deprecation means \"things will work but will break\" while here the message is \"things are not working even though you might think it does\".\n\nI\u0027ve also switched to kOtherMessageSource. I will update the CL description accordingly.",
