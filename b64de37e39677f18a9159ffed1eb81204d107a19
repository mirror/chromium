I guess it will be something like:\n\n  src/tools/perf/run_benchmark run ......\n\nI understand I need the recorded webpages (leak_detection_000.wprgo) but I assume these will be downloaded on-the-fly when I start the test?\n\nI\u0027m asking because I\u0027m interested in running variants of this test to test if other web pages leak (I have some suspects).",
