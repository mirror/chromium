      "message": "The reason we\u0027re switching to proto for the D-Bus call is because it\u0027s a major hassle adding/modifying parameters as it crosses the Chrome OS/Chrome boundary. This is not the case for this method - it\u0027s all Chrome. If we switched this function to take a proto, then the caller would have to serialize the proto and the interface would be less readable.",

      "message": "Generally speaking, D-Bus client classes should contain minimal code which is needed to pass arguments to the service process crossing the process boundary for better test coverage, and this also applies to proto packing code.\nhttps://chromium.git.corp.google.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/dbus_in_chrome.md#Keep-your-class-minimal\n\nThe only user of JoinAdDomain() and AuthenticateUser() is chromeos/login/auth/authpolicy_login_helper.cc, and I think moving proto packing code to there wouldn\u0027t affect the readability.",
