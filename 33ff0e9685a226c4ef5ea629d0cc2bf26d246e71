      "message": "So far, there is the case multiple buffer format is used with the same internal format, but there isn\u0027t an opposite case.\ne.g.\n    case gfx::BufferFormat::RGBA_4444:\n    case gfx::BufferFormat::RGBA_F16:\n      return internalformat \u003d\u003d GL_RGBA;\n\nDo you want to remain it for future generalization? In my opinion, as buffer format is quite 1:1 to fourcc format, which implies one internal format under the mesa.\n\nIn the case in the future that Mac and ChromeOS needs to point out different internal format, I think we can use #ifdef.",
