      "message": "nit: in most places in this file, we just use the presence of offscreen_target_frame_buffer_ to determine if we\u0027re offscreen. Could we do that in ::Destroy() too (just grab the state before we reset it)?\n\nAlternatively, we can change code everywhere to use this new data member, but I would prefer not having 2 ways of checking offscreen state.",
