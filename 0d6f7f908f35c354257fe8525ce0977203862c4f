Would it make sense to DCHECK that all entries have been set and and no entries have been set twice (overwriting the old value)?\n\u003e \n\nAdded DCHECK to ensure that an explicit value was assigned to each property.\n\n\u003e Would it make sense to have different bool_sets_ for different categories of constraints?\n\nNo, it would not. The reason is that different categories would depend on the part of the algorithm (setup, apply constraint sets, select based on ideal). It is simpler to store all boolsets in the same array, and have some mappings where they clearly help simplify code.\nIn particular the apply constraint sets part benefits directly from having them all in the same array.",
