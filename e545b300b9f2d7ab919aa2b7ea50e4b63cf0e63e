Or is this too different from how the rest of Chrome currently works?\n\n(This might also obviate the need for |position| as well, since the array of items would implicitly have position associated with it)",

      "message": "This struct is like this so that we can do minimum update (via mojo calls) when an item is moved or re-parented. This is inline with how it currently works when the model data is changed from sync.\n\n* Move an item from position x to position y.\n    If we use an array for the list, then we need to re-send the array. But\n    with the |position| field, we can just send the changed item and let\n    the UI code to sort by the ordinal to get the re-ordered list.\n\n* Reparent (move item from one folder to another).\n    If we use array, then we need to send the array of both the old parent\n    and new parent. With the |folder id|, we can just send the changed item,\n    and UI code would figure out where to put the item.",
