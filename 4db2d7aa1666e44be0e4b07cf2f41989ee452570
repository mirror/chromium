      "message": "The reason behind having such checks is ServerWindow::SetProperty. What it does is simply changing the actual show state according to possible ui::mojom::ShowState enums. \n\nSo, if a window is maximized and then set to fullscreen, and a user presses F11 to exit the fullscreen mode, aura actually calls DesktopWindowTreeHostMus::SetFullscreen(false), which is correct. But on the ws side, a corresponding ws::ServerWindow receives maximized property (if it has been maximized and then fullscreen, the property is set to maximized after the fullscreen state, by the way). https://github.com/Igalia/chromium/commit/84c815efea42ee5e19e448fc307433bf53ffd753#diff-d6be100e16026a0c866a3e3965dde101\n\nThus, what PlatformDisplayDefault gets is the properties of ServerWindows, and based on that knowledge it changes the PlatformWindow\u0027s (X11WindowOzone or WaylandWindow) states.\nYou can see it from here.\n\nThat\u0027s the reason behind such a design.",
