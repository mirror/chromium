      "message": "I slightly prefer this, because it makes it more obvious (to me) when we\u0027re asserting that something did *not* run (as we do on line 626 of this patch set).  I understand that a strict mock will fail if it receives an unexpected call, but I think that\u0027s much more subtle and not as readable in a test (and also a bit more fragile, since I think it\u0027s more likely someone would change the mock without seeing the consequences).  Additionally, we\u0027ll need a subclass anyway for CallingNotifyWhenNotPausedAndDestroyingTheContext (where we set a specific callback to be run).\n\nWDYT?  If you feel strongly, I can update to use a mock.\n\n(Note: this would also be made more complicated now that we use a unique_ptr for the callback, since the helper will be destroyed by this point.)",
