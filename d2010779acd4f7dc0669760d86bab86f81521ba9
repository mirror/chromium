      "message": "so looks like this was in before, but I don\u0027t think you should be using the the vulkan.h we have checked into third_party/vulkan. That is there purely so our code can build when vulkan is not enabled in skia (since a few public APIs use some vulkan types in them). We have no intention of keeping that that header up to date outside of making sure the few things in the public API are there.\n\nThe right approach is for chromium to have their own header they are using, whether it is from the SDK,manually curated, whatever.",
