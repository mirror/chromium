      "message": "So, I understand why we\u0027d want to bypass the CompositorLock, but the ResizeLock does more, in particular throttle input events so that we don\u0027t try to resize things (read: renderers) faster than we can process. See DelegatedFrameHostClientAura::DelegatedFrameHostCreateResizeLock where  host-\u003edispatcher()-\u003eHoldPointerMoves() is the part that does that. You\u0027d want to keep that, but I suppose not take the CompositorLock? We\u0027d still want something to call DelegatedFrameHostClientAura::CompositorResizeLockEnded if we timed out (this is currently done via the CompositorLock timeout).",

      "message": "Ahh, good point. In aura-mus, we already deal with this by holding pointer moves until a DidReceiveCompositorFrameAck comes back from the compositor. Basically, with surface sync, we don\u0027t send back an ack until the frame activates. A frame will activate when its dependencies are resolved or it hits a deadline, so the behavior is the same as here. I\u0027ll see what I can do to refactor this code a bit to do that. Please hold off until then.",
