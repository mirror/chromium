      "message": "The comment here is now wrong (since this doesn\u0027t return a browser).  The name of the function also feels confusing since it doesn\u0027t return a browser via an outparam either, but inside |params|.\n\nDid we really need to get rid of the return value?  It seems to have bought more code duplication (in addition to my confusion here) than it saved.",

      "message": "I too would normally return it, but |params-\u003ebrowser| just gets set in the (only/sole) caller, so it seemed like a wasted step. Also note that on line 137 we clobber another field. I thought we should go one way (const NavigateParms\u0026 or, even better, individual parameters) or the other and it seems like we prefer a non-const in/out params. (It also felt weird returning the browser and passing the tab index.) I\u0027m happy to go the other way if it looks better to you.",
