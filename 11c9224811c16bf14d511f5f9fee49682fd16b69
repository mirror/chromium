      "message": "The comment here is now wrong (since this doesn\u0027t return a browser).  The name of the function also feels confusing since it doesn\u0027t return a browser via an outparam either, but inside |params|.\n\nDid we really need to get rid of the return value?  It seems to have bought more code duplication (in addition to my confusion here) than it saved.",

I think that would basically be equivalent to replacing this range-based loop with an iterator one that uses begin/end_last_active()?",
