      "message": "You should look at search_box_model.h which contains these four fields. on_icon and on_tooltip are no longer used and can be deleted. The off_* versions should have a different comment (since it mentions hotword).\n\nAlso I\u0027m not sure this is even used any more. From what I can tell in Code Search, the only call to create a SpeechButtonProperty is in the code you deleted above. So it\u0027s possible that speech_button_prop is now always null, so this entire code block (\"if (speech_button_prop)\" above) is dead code. Please consider whether this is true and possibly delete all this code, and the SpeechButtonProperty class in search_box_model.h.",
