      "message": "This is here because web_state_impl.h participates in almost every circular dependency. F.e. web controller and web_state_impl depend on each other. Same goes for navigation_manager, interstitial and a few other classes. I think these circular dependencies are indication of design flaws inside ios/web where classes depend on WebStateImpl instead of depending on delegates, but that\u0027s a bigger problem which can be solved when we start writing real unit tests for ios/web.",
