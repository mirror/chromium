      "message": "This makes a round trip to the X server.  This is bad because\n1. We\u0027re getting state out-of-sync.  For example, the user can press alt+e and let go of alt.  Once this code runs, alt will not be held, but it was at the time of the event.\n2. This is a blocking call on the UI thread.  We have a lot of these to X11 already, but lets try not to add any more.\n\nSince the menu is being opened in response to a key event, the event should come with a modmap.  In the XKeyEvent, you can check if Mod1Mask is set.",
