      "message": "This test is actually checking mock data, you have two options:\n- improve InspectorTest.addScriptUISourceCode method and make it possible to add worklet uiSourceCode,\n- introduce separate test, you can use http/tests/inspector/resource-tree/resource-tree-non-unique-url.html as example:\n   a) create a page with worklet and add it to the resources folder (non-local urls are not supported by test runner).\n   b) use function like waitForUISourceCodeAdded from navigator-view.html and wait until worklet script arrived,\n   c) use InspectorTest.dumpResourcesTree() to dump navigator view.\n\nI prefer second option, since first one looks a little over complicated.",
