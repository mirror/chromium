      "message": "It sounded like on the spec the designers were proposing omitting the input_in_progress() check so this could be used to clear the permanent text as well.  WDYT of that?  I think it would sort of make sense to show this any time the box has focus.  Imagine tapping after the text and then wanting to delete everything.  You need to either hold down backspace or select all and then delete.",
