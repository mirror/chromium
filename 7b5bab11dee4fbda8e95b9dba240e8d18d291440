The more FakeAutocompleteProviderClient implements (fakely) the API of AutocompleteProviderClient, the more likely it will be to be useful in future tests.",

      "message": "Fake... already had this very method, so it was trivial to nuke it and the whole class.\n\nI moved some short-cuts stuff down, but hesitated to remove the \u0027pool\u0027 stuff. Reading the class description, it sounds like an intentional addition and, while the test worked for me without it (on one platform), I didn\u0027t want to introduce any flakiness (to the others). I believe you recently looked into some of these class types; if you feel strongly one way, let me know.",

Regardless, I\u0027d rather not keep it on just a fear that it may be required as opposed to knowing for sure. Can you try removing it, run git cl try and we\u0027ll see if any of the bots fail?",
