      "message": "the TestingObserver is intended to be private to page_load_metrics tests. I don\u0027t want to leak it to non page load metrics code. Can we instead write this test in the page load metrics codebase, since we are really asserting a certain property of page load metrics code (that a given tab is treated as having started in the foreground)?\n\nBTW we tend to assert things in page_load_metrics_browsertest.cc by histogram. So rather than adding this boolean param you could assert that a histogram that is only expected to be logged in the foreground is actually logged.",
