      "message": "This was not needed before. I think it might because the mojo interface was in content/common. After the move, when running Chrome, it ended with the following error: \"Check failed: false. The Service Manager prevented service \"content_renderer\" from binding interface \"media::mojom::VideoCaptureHost\" in target service \"content_browser\". You probably need to update one or more service manifests to ensure that \"content_browser\" exposes \"media::mojom::VideoCaptureHost\" through a capability and that \"content_renderer\" requires that capability from the \"content_browser\" service.\" So I modified the manifest files as guided. Please let me know if I misunderstand anything.",
