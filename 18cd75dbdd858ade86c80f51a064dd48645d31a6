Maybe we can say this in a more straightforward way...\n\n\u0027It sets the |zero_idle_timer_delay_| to true and calls MaybeTriggerTimeoutTimer(), which may call the idle callback if there are no inflight events.  If there are, the callback will be called next time when the set of inflight events become empty in EndEvent().\u0027\n\n(Disclaimer: I\u0027m not the best English reviewer)",
