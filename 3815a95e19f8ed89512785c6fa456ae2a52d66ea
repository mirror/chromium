      "message": "I don\u0027t think these should be free-standing functions in base namespace (e.g. base:Sort() shouldn\u0027t be something specific to internals of statistics recorder). Instead, you can make them static functions inside StatisticsRecorder class.\n\nAlso, I\u0027m wondering given that these aren\u0027t really used outside of the .cc and unit tests, whether we can limit how they are exposed?\n\nFor example, GetHistograms() seems to be used only by tests outside the class. So maybe we can just make GetSortedHistogramsForTesting()?\n\nAnd for the other two functions, maybe we can just add conditions to the functions that care about these in their iteration?",
