      "message": "Currently there is no common test targets as Android and iOS were pretty separate. \n\nThe one for Android is instrumentation_test_apk(\"cronet_test_instrumentation_apk\") and one for iOS is test(\"cronet_test\") with dependencies on Cronet.framework. Those probably should stay separate as they test public API and have very platform-specific packaging nuances.\n\nFor cronet_unittests we also have two separate targets (android:cronet_unittests and cronet_unittests_ios), but those statically link their dependencies, and probably could/should be merged.\n\nFor fuchsia we could add one under ../fuchsia or top level cronet.",
