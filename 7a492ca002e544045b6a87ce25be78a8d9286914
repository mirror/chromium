      "message": "As far as I understand, this part of the CL is now independent of the second part, which adds the new constructor, is that right? In that case, I suggest to split this into two CLs. \n\nThis simplification looks good to me now, even though I find it surprising that we have two parser modes here: One kCSSFontFaceRuleMode going into the MutableStylePropertySet construction, and one as a member of context. I am curious, which one is used?",
