      "message": "Interesting..so perhaps there is some kind of rounding happening with non-integer scale factors here which I assume means that GetLocalBounds().width() returns something larger than what the width was previously set to? Could you file a bug for someone to investigate that? Apparently oshima@ knows something about scale factors and views folks would I guess be interested.\n\nI am guessing we\u0027re applying the scale factor at some point and then we\u0027re reading back the value and it\u0027s getting rounded/clipped to something larger than what it originally was. But I don\u0027t know the code well enough.",
