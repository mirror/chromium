      "message": "I am sorry if this TODO mislead you. There has been a lot of refactor going on in these classes with the ongoing mojo project and most of the stuff will be outdated soon(hopefully). This TODO was referring to VideoCaptureDevice::Client::Buffer::data()[0] which no longer exists. Additionally, we no longer consider I420 as the only supported format. \n\nI would go with chfremer@s suggestion and only deleting this TODO.\n\n[0] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/bcd0585fc2b25d2f87d15982e7aeae4b8364888a/media/capture/video/video_capture_device.h",
