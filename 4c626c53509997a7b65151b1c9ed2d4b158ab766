This TODO was referring to VideoCaptureDevice::Client::Buffer::data()[0] which no longer exists. Additionally, we no longer consider I420 as the only supported format. \n\nThat\u0027s alright. May be I should have had a discussion before attempting this change.\nAnyway, I have updated this CL to delete the TODO. \nAlso, I have added a minor refactor of removing InitializeI420PlanePointers(), if that\u0027s okay with you?.\n\n\u003e I would go with chfremer@s suggestion and only deleting this TODO.\n\u003e \n\u003e [0] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/bcd0585fc2b25d2f87d15982e7aeae4b8364888a/media/capture/video/video_capture_device.h",
