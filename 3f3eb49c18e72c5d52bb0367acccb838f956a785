      "message": "Why does the ordering here matter and how does the change of delegate affect the ink drop? It seems like the InkDrop will change to ACTION_TRIGGERED either way here: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ash/shelf/shelf_view.cc?l\u003d1741\nI don\u0027t quite understand how this fix helps anything, but it probably won\u0027t work for mash, where the callback is run in a separate process for ash (and thus not guaranteed to run before the LaunchApp call below). It may even be a flaky fix on regular ToT Classic Ash ChromeOS, since afaik, it\u0027s still an async mojo callback even when running Ash in the Chrome process.",
