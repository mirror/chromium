      "message": "Were you planning to leave them grouped like this, or re-sort them?\n\nIn one sense, I\u0027m tempted to say that if we don\u0027t sort all of the dependencies by name, then switching from deps_os to the main block isn\u0027t actually much of an improvement.\n\nOn the other hand, I can see an argument for sorting by \"condition\" and then name, where the unconditional deps show up first, and I think that\u0027s closer to what you\u0027ve done here.\n\nThough, I still think I prefer sorting by name.",

In particular, in the cases where we have similar deps that vary by platform that would allow us to have the entries for \u0027src/third_party/some_lib_mac\u0027 and \u0027src/third_party/some_lib_android\u0027 right next to each other in the list.",
