      "message": "For both DoRecvFrom() and DoSendTo() you have a 1-at-a-time piping; you don\u0027t provide the next buffer to the underlying socket until the previous one has been returned.  For DoSendTo() that makes sense to me; that will mean that OS calls can\u0027t be overlapped, but presumably there won\u0027t be a major latency hit because of not pipelining across the OS boundary.  But I at least wanted to raise the issue as to whether the lack of pipelining on the RecvFrom() side might hurt, specifically as to whether it might result in some packets being dropped.  It\u0027s probably absolutely fine (if I understand the interface, it\u0027s what SetReceiveBufferSize() is *for*) but I wanted to at least raise the possibility of just doing a set of RecvFrom calls on the underlying socket to allow it to toss buffers back at you as the packets come in.  Up to you.",
