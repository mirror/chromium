      "message": "it\u0027s not just that - the old method did not really work, except for CreateWindowInDefaultContainer.\n\nE.g. for CreateWindowInAlwaysOnTopContainer, aura::client::kAlwaysOnTopKey property was set on the window *after* ParentWindowWithContext was called, so the window would get parented to default container - ParentWindowWithContext uses container solely to get the appropriate root window to use, and makes the decision about the target container based only the window properties - which would at the time be missing kAlwaysOnTopKey.\n\n(i.e. container_id was pretty much ignored - we\u0027d have the same result doing\naura::client::ParentWindowWithContext(window, root_window, gfx::Rect(....)));",
