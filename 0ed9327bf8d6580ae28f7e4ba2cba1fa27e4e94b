The first sentence says that we have a \u0027detailed StopTrigger\u0027, but we map that to UNKNOWN_STOP_TRIGGER which sounds like we are losing information.  (I may be reading this wrong, though).\n\n\nIt sounds like you are saying that if we see LOCAL_PLAYBACK as the RemotingStopReason here it means that we have already transitioned to mirroring and there should have been a previous call to this method with the actual reason, is that right?",
