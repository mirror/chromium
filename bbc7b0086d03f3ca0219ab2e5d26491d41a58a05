      "message": "Prior to the change in crbug.com/738627, we used Profile#getLastUsedProfile() and passed a Profile object from Java to this C++ class. #getLastUsedProfile() was returning the regular profile even when the incognito profile was in use.\n\nI did a quick test to confirm that this is still an issue on Android (it is). It appears that desktop (Linux) always opens history in a regular tab (even if chrome://history is entered in the URL bar on an incognito tab), so there\u0027s no need to copy the logic there. I\u0027m not sure if this will affect iOS or not.",
