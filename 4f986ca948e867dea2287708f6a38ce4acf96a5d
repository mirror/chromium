I still have a task to update save_card_bubble_views.cc to make it harmony compliant, but the non-Harmony version still seems like a win because the Views flow actually has more functionality in the dialog as of M62.",

The credit card bubbles are more complex, and there are web-modals with textfields which we haven\u0027t tried to launch outside of WebPayments.",
