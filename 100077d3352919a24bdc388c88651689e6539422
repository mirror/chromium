      "message": "This is a raw pointer, who owns it? Comment on its lifecycle.\nHow does this pointer get cleared if the tree changes and the\nAXNode goes away?\n\nI think I was imagining that we wouldn\u0027t even need an object for\nevery node. One object for the tree would suffice. To access the\nname, call GetName(id). Or we could have an object like this but\nit could store a pointer to the AXTree and the node id instead of a\npointer to the AXNode instead, that might make the lifecycle easier.",
