We\u0027d have to rename every file in the following (not exhaustive) set of directories: c/b/webshare, c/b/ui/views/webshare,\nWebKit/public/platform/modules/webshare,\nandroid/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/webshare/.\n\nIt\u0027s not appropriate for Gio to do this now, just on this one file or directory. I could make a CL that does them all in one go but it is a very low priority because it\u0027s a lot of churn for almost no value.",
