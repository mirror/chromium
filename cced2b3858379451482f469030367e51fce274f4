Likewise most user-agent bits can actually be set on the WebMouseEvent (and we can actually clone that field on the DOM event, although for the default mouse event it isn\u0027t right now)",

      "message": "IIUC, the new class will be used only as an internal class, so we don\u0027t need IDL for it.\n\nIf it was not that case, we do need to introduce IDL for this new subclass. However, the new class will have only two extra fields (|event_data_| and |menu_source_type_|) and few related functions. We are not exposing them to IDL currently, so from the binding side, it will be identical to MouseEvent mostly. From this perspective, having a new subclass won\u0027t buy us that much IMO. On the other hand, if IDL was necessary, will the new class introduce a spec change in https://w3c.github.io/ later? How does that process?",
