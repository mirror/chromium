      "message": "I still really don\u0027t understand why we need this intermediate class, especially when the net result is that we\u0027re only intercepting a single message? Seems unnecessary -- and more maintenance burden when FrameHost changes -- to stub out the entire FrameHost interface rather than simply adding a test interface to control DCPL handling behavior on RFHI.\n\nIn the simplest case where you just want to observe the messages, you could add a RFHI::SetDidCommitProvisionalLoadCallbackForTesting interface. To support the case where you want to defer (which doesn\u0027t appear to be supported yet by this CL), you could e.g. have the callback return a bool (defer or not) and the RFHI::DCPL implementation could itself maintain a queue of deferred events.\n\nI haven\u0027t understood what you mean by \"mocking the binder\" or what that would have to do with this suggestion?",
