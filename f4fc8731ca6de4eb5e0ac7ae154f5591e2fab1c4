      "message": "In PS1, the CQ dry-run failed. Turns out there were tests I hadn\u0027t run on my desktop that showed I made an incorrect assumption. So, I fixed the math here (and in gl_renderer.cc) to make them green.\n\nMore detail: I had assumed that CopyOutputRequest::area was relative to the upper-left corner of the Render Pass\u0027s output_rect. However, it is not; they are in the same coordinate system. Thus, for example, if output_rect is \"-100,-100 200x200\" and the CopyOutputRequest::area is set to \"0,0 100x100,\" the correct interpretation is \"copy the lower-right quadrant of the Render Pass\u0027s output,\" and NOT \"copy the upper-right quadrant.\"",
