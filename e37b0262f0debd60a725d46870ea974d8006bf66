      "message": "sort-of nit: I\u0027m concerned that this sort might not produce optimal results. Consider:\n\nOriginal image: 2x400\ntarget size: 1x50\navailable sizes: 1x200, 1x100\n\nBecause the widths are the same in both available sizes, neither will return true from the following function and they will be considered equal. In this case they may not be re-arranged in the sort (seems like order is arbitrary at that point).\n\nBelow, we will check 1x200 first, it will fulfill the requirements, and we will scale from that. Unfortunately, the optimal size to scale from was 1x100.\n\nMaybe we want to do a comparison based on \"area1 \u003c area2\" - this should work out as the cases with different source rects will be thrown out below?",

      "message": "Hmm that makes sense. I think that\u0027s a pretty rare case and if in the loop below one of them can be locked it\u0027s probably still better than decoding the original. The actual source we use to downscale doesn\u0027t really matter, but this might be a good follow up for improvement.\n\nOne thing we might do, since we know these are all mips is to compare only the largest dimension.",
