      "message": "Why does being a multi texture mask change the draw transform here? Is it wrong in both cases?\n\nAdditionally, the draw transform includes the scale of the layer itself.  This definitely needs a test where the PictureLayerImpl::MaximumContentsScale differs between the mask and the layer it\u0027s masking.",
