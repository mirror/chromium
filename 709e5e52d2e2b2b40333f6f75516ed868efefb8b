      "message": "In Linux Environment, remember the PowerSaveBlocker can only run in the \"windowed\" unittest(with -xvfb), it crashs in some place of the DBUS in the \"console\" unittest. So in the service_unittest of wake lock, we add a static bool \"is_in_unittest_\" in WakeLockProvider and also a \"wake_lock_for_testing.cc\".\n\nNow it is the same. If we go with the TestServiceManagerContext, we have to set \"is_in_unittest_ \u003d true\" in current unittest. We also need to move the \"is_in_unittest_\" from WakeLockProvider into wake_lock/public/cpp/ to make it avaiable for the outer unittest.\n\nIt is not complex. I just feel that using SetFakeWakeLock() is much lightweight, unittests don\u0027t need to really Create the ServiceManagerContext and launch the DeviceService either.",
