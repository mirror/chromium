So if we want to do this, we can probably make a Shutdown() method instead that does this.\n\nAnyway, if you do want to experiment with this, I think we should split that into a different change than the one that\u0027s removing the DeletePersistentLocation() logic.",

      "message": "This isn\u0027t a final collect though. This is on background - on Android.\n\nI don\u0027t agree of changing logic such that we don\u0027t record histograms in this case, but still close a log. I don\u0027t think that behavior makes sense.\n\nAlso, I believe Android metrics reporting is reliant on this because they tag logs with CCT status - because switching activities between Chrome and another app with a ChromeCustomTab will close the log. So all metrics in that log are associated with the correct status.\n\nThis would break this.",
