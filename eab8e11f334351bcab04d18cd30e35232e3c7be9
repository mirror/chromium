      "message": "Ah I responded to David\u0027s comment as well. Basically I was only returning START_STICKY because it was the default response, but changed it to START_NOT_STICKY. Seems like if the passing of information to native gets interrupted/Chrome crashes, everything gets paused anyways so it doesn\u0027t matter what the notification interaction is. (And hopefully with the future refactors Chrome will crash less...)",
