      "message": "This common code is trying to use RasterInterface, but I guess that is client-specific. It now causes a GN loop error:\n\nThe target:\n  //components/viz/common:common\nis including a file from the target:\n  //gpu/command_buffer/client:raster_interface\n\nIt\u0027s usually best to depend directly on the destination target.\nIn some cases, the destination target is considered a subcomponent\nof an intermediate target. In this case, the intermediate target\nshould depend publicly on the destination to forward the ability\nto include headers.\n\nDependency chain (there may also be others):\n  //components/viz/common:common --\u003e\n  //gpu/command_buffer/client:raster --\u003e\n  //gpu:raster --\u003e\n  //gpu/command_buffer/client:raster_sources --[private]--\u003e\n  //gpu/command_buffer/client:raster_interface\n\nBut in general viz deps on gpu, not vice versa, so should I move this to viz client/ or should I make gpu stop deping on viz common or both?\n\n+enne",
