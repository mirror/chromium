      "message": "This version \u003e\u003d 26 check is a temportary workaround for the fact that unique_name_helper_unittest simulates legacy encoding by stamping an artificially low version(24) onto the encoding produced by the latest versions of WritePageState/WriteFrameState. This simulation fails if the latest versions of WritePageState/WriteFrameState alter the serialization format, since we\u0027re telling ReadFrameState to read format v24 from a v26 object. This possibility was foreseen and discussed when unique_name_helper_unittest was reviewed, but no consensus was reached on the best way to deal with it.",
