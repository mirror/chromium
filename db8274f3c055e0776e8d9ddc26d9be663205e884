      "message": "Hrm. Where does this get called? It seems unfortunate that we\u0027d ever potentially handle a response without having header information.\n\n---\n\nSkimming through a little bit, I\u0027m not sure that changing `content::ResourceThrottle::WillProcessResponse()`\u0027s signature is reasonable for this patch (though I\u0027m also surprised that they\u0027ve gotten away without passing in data to the handler?). Still, I\u0027d prefer that we not make this a pointer-based API. Instead, how about just constructing an empty `ResourceResponseHead` here and passing it in as a `const ResourceResponseHead\u0026`?",
