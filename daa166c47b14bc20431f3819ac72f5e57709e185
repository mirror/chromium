Because of the way templates and intermediate targets work, I think it\u0027s unlikely that we\u0027ll get to a point where gn_all \u003d\u003d all; you\u0027d have to list too many random things that we don\u0027t actually care about.\n\n(which is what I realized when I stopped trying to make this work).\n\nI think it\u0027s actually safe to delete \"All\" at this point, as well.",

      "message": "Ok, so the current state-of-play seems to be:\n\n1. (we think) \u0027All\u0027 is no longer required. (Though I notice that we mention \"All\" at least in the gn_isolate_map.pyl)\n2. gn_all is a practical approximation of \"all\"; think of it as \"all the stuff we care about building\". It could go away once we have \"all\" working on all platforms.\n3. In principle \"all\" should build cleanly, on all platforms, at least for the default config. In practice it doesn\u0027t on some platforms, yet.\n\n\"all\" does get used on some bots, so is it reasonable to aim for #3, still, do you think?",

      "message": "We actually expect \"all\" to work on every platform and should have builders explicitly testing that, though we don\u0027t actually do official builds of \"all\" because we don\u0027t want to make *everything* build with LTO/LTCG/PGO/etc.\n\nWe make an exception for platforms that are still being brought up, of course :).\n\nFor the reasons I gave above, I don\u0027t actually expect \"gn_all\" to ever go away as a target, but once \"all\" does work, I expect it to stay working and for a platform to use that rather than \"gn_all\" in builder configs.\n\nAnd, because of that, I don\u0027t actually think of gn_all\" as a practical approximation of \"all\", but that\u0027s probably because I\u0027m an overly hypercritical build guy :).",
