Because of the way templates and intermediate targets work, I think it\u0027s unlikely that we\u0027ll get to a point where gn_all \u003d\u003d all; you\u0027d have to list too many random things that we don\u0027t actually care about.\n\n(which is what I realized when I stopped trying to make this work).\n\nI think it\u0027s actually safe to delete \"All\" at this point, as well.",
