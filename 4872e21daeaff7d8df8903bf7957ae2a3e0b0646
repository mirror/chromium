      "message": "The new code does not take into account transform when determining fragment clips. Transform\nis instead applied as a post-fragmentation-paint effect. I adjusted this \n\nFirefox\u0027s also applies transform afterward, and the spec seems to agree:\nhttps://drafts.csswg.org/css-break-3/#transforms\n\nHowever, Chrome also clips the transform at the edge of the fragmentation area. This is\ndue to a too-small area for the CempositingRecorder for the opacity effect. This should\nbe fixed automatically by SPv2.",
