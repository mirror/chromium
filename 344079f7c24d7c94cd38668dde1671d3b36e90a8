      "message": "I find these tests a little strange. We know that the canceled raf functions will never be called so it doesn\u0027t matter what they do. I\u0027m a little concerned about their validity given the only time you may have seen a raf request is the very first frame but none of the tests verify that we do see a single raf as the raf requests continue to loop.",
