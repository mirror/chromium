I\u0027m glad we\u0027re landing\nthis first, but we should acknowledge that it\u0027s worth coming back to.)\"\n\nCamille, what\u0027s your opinion on the observers?  And I think the race we were discussing was the one you were trying to fix with the IDs (though my memory is a bit rusty).  Probably worth leaving a TODO for it with a bit of an explanation, so we don\u0027t forget.",
