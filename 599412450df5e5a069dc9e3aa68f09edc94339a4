      "message": "The only edge case I worry about is if |webViewLoadingStateDidChange| happens before |webView:didCommitNavigation|. Then _loadStatus will be changed to PAGE_LOADED first and later may fail the DCHECK(_loadStatus \u003d\u003d REQUESTED) in |webPageChangedWithContext:|.\n\nCan you try loading about:blank with this change and see if it triggers the DCHECK? If not, it\u0027s probably OK for now. For regular page loads, _webView.isLoading should be true until after |webView:didFinishNavigation| is called.\n\nI feel this is another case where we\u0027re conflating loading and navigation though. It would be nice if we can tease them apart at some point.",
