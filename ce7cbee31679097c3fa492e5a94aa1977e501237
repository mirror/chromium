The goal of the comment would be to explain to readers why this is being placed in read-only memory.\n\nMaybe something like:\n\n// The function pointer for CERT_CacheOCSPResponseFromSideChannel is saved to read-only\n// memory after dynamically loading it. This is done as a security mitigation to prevent\n// the function pointer from being tampered with.\n// See crbug.com/771365 for details on this code pattern.\n\nI don\u0027t think this comment needs to mention that CFI is also disabled when making the indirect function call later, but I will leave the exact wording up to you :)",
