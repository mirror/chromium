      "message": "This should document why we\u0027d take both an anchor view and an anchor point: basically, that we expect only one to be non-null.\n\nThat said, I don\u0027t feel good about how LocationBarView exposes both GetInfoBarAnchorPoint() and GetSecurityBubbleAnchorView() today, and we anchor to one on Mac and the other on non-Mac.  I think ideally this class would expose only one of those (probably the latter), and it would be implemented on Mac and non-Mac, and we\u0027d call it everywhere and just pass that.\n\nWhat blocks doing things that way?",
