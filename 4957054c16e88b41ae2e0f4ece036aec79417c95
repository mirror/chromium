      "message": "“Relocatable” is somewhat imperfect terminology in that it’s ELF shorthand for what most people less intimately familiar with ELF would probably understand as “object file.” Certainly, ET_DYN files are relocatable in a related but different sense. Best to say “relocatable object file” to avoid ambiguity, or settle on using the constants ET_REL and ET_CORE which at least put things into context.",

      "message": "But you’ll still leave cur_base at whatever it was from a previous iteration of the loop, and you’ll wind up setting r.base.\n\nPerhaps it’s best to move the declaration and 0-initialization of cur_base just inside the loop. In that case, ET_EXEC can be handled in default: with the comment augmented to state that it’s where you expect to deal with ET_EXEC and that 0 is correct because they’re not relocatable.",
