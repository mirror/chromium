Because in this scenario there are no frame or\n    renderer boundaries crossed, we don\u0027t have to worry about one\n    (potentially compromised) renderer being responsible for enforcing the\n    CSP of another (victim) renderer.

For the moment, we only know its origin.\nIf we knew it, we could check CSP on it for instance.\n\nBut there is an issue with it:\nLet A and B be two window.\n1) A triggers a form submission, it targets B (with url x)\n2) A checks form-action CSP for the initial load.\n3) A closes itself.\n4) The browser makes B navigating, it must check A\u0027s CSP (and no more B\u0027s CSP), but there is no more A.\n\n#2  ----\nMaybe we could freeze A\u0027s CSP in an object when the navigation is initiated and uses it for each redirects.
