      "message": "Is this gauranteed to be safe? It seems like a lot of assumption to make at this level, especially in a key event handler. \n\nAlso, I\u0027ve been out of Views for a while and I\u0027m fuzzy about the difference between the logic abopve and tray_bubble_view_-\u003eparent()-\u003eContains()?\n\nEither way, I think this would be more clear and safer as something like:\nparent \u003d tray_bubble_view_-\u003eGetParent();\nif (parent \u0026\u0026 parent-\u003eContains(target))\n\nWith |parent| being a Window or a View depending on which is more correct. sky@ will know the answer and may have a better solution.",
