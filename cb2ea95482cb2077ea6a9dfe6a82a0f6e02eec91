Most of the time a user is looking for an obscure page from their history by typing in the title, tail suggest will trigger.  If it triggers and happens to score higher than the page from the user\u0027s history, then we\u0027ll filter all non-tail suggestions.  This will kill the page from the user\u0027s history.\n\nI would suggest a stricter test, say, if tail suggest isn\u0027t \"enough\" of the dropdown, delete all tail suggest.  Never delete other types of suggestions.  Tail suggest, almost by definition, is guaranteed to be worse quality than any ordinary suggestions that match the input.  Thus, regardless of tail suggestion scores, it shouldn\u0027t cause the removal of ordinary suggestions.",

If one fails, revise the input (e.g., delete a relevant score, remove a suggestion, whatever) then goto 2.\n\nIndeed, that code is SearchProvider is designed exactly to enforce what we think is sensible, protecting against inappropriate or otherwise bad server scores.  It seems to me that this is exactly the same type of situation here.\n\nThis should get rid of my worries about duplicates.\n\nTo rephrase, my suggestion here would conceptually be something like:\n1. at beginning of SortAndCull, make a copy of |matches_|, call it |orig_matches|\n.2 where this code is, instead say:\nif (dropdown has tail suggest and dropdown has something that is not tail suggest and not search-what-you-typed) { revise orig_matches to remove all tail suggest; set matches_ \u003d orig_matches; goto beginning of SortAndCull }\n\n(Obviously this is not a code structure; the idea should be obvious.
