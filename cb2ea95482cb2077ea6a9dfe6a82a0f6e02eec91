Most of the time a user is looking for an obscure page from their history by typing in the title, tail suggest will trigger.  If it triggers and happens to score higher than the page from the user\u0027s history, then we\u0027ll filter all non-tail suggestions.

Never delete other types of suggestions.  Tail suggest, almost by definition, is guaranteed to be worse quality than any ordinary suggestions that match the input.
