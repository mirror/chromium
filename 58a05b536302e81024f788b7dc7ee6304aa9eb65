      "message": "This puts a dependency on extensions from chrome/common, which is usually something we want to avoid (since extensions aren\u0027t always compiled everywhere chrome/common is).  I wonder if it would make sense to store theme_color on WebApplicationInfo and AppThemeColorInfo as an optional, rather than having a separate invalid theme color value?  What\u0027s more, from the comments above content::Manifest::theme_color [1], it sounds like the color could potentially be any int32 value, potentially including -1.  Using an optional would solve that, too.\n\n[1] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/d3a1af75d3e64c5cf6e1cf54a8ff1aadb9b9359b/content/public/common/manifest.h#144",
