      "message": "Originally, I was planning on plumbing this directly through the parent frame. However, there is a potential race condition there: if we pass it directly to the parent, it is possible that the parent will have navigated somewhere else before we report the timing information. This would leak information about an iframe load on a previous Document. To fix this, I moved this plumbing to FrameOwner: we report the timing information through *this* frame\u0027s RenderFrameProxy. That way, if the parent Document navigates, the RenderFrameProxy will be destroyed, and the resource timing will be ignored.",
