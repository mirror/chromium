      "message": "yea I don\u0027t think this is right - I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any guarantee that it will be inserted back into the hierarchy under the mouse cursor, so it\u0027s just as likely to end up with a grey hover when it shouldn\u0027t have one.\n\nBut! I think there\u0027s an assumption this method is making which we have now changed. This was probably written when a removal would only ever happen when details.child \u003d\u003d this. But now other child views can be removed. So I think we just need to change `\u0026\u0026 !IsHotTracked()` -\u003e `\u0026\u0026 details.child \u003d\u003d this`",
