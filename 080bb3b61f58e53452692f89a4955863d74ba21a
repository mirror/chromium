      "message": "My main suggestion would to focus on the purpose and why, rather than the specifics.\n\nMaybe something like:\n\nCalled when the size of the view changes. Implementations of\nEmbeddedContentView should call LayoutEmbeddedContent::UpdateGeomtry\nand update any internal bookkeeping (such as triggering relayout if\nneeded).\n\n(Sorry I didn\u0027t have a very good understanding of this before, so your comment helped me understand. Btw, another common way to do this is to put the call to the LayoutEmbeddedContent::UpdateGeometry in the base class method implementation, and require\nsubclasses to delegate to it. That\u0027s what Frame::Detach() does.)",
