      "message": "I\u0027m assuming here that the flake is that the pending tree is the sync tree, which doesn\u0027t exist and so it crashes?\n\nIf the \"if (TestEnded())\" call is moved up to the top, would that fix the problem? Or alternatively if the sync tree doesn\u0027t exist, we should assert the test is ended and then early out?\n\nMy (very minor) concern is that this change makes it look like the test might want to look at something that\u0027s not the sync tree, when really that\u0027s not the case.",

      "message": "How about this? We can\u0027t quite do either, the test wants to run through WillPrepareTilesOnThread() with a source frame number !\u003d 0 at least once before calling EndTest().\n\nIf we fall back to the active tree we can do that gracefully (and is what the test was doing before my CommitToActiveTree() rework). Or we can just bail out if we\u0027ve no sync tree, and we will still end gracefully on a subsequent call. Open to other thoughts.",
