      "message": "- About the svg file, we had to create a custom version of the icon to make sure it\u0027s sharp and matches the pixel grid at 16x16 and 32x32. It\u0027s not identical to the 48x48 vpn_key icon from go/icons. If it is not a strict rule to use 48x48, i think we can stick with this one :)\n- About the naming, yes we should be consistent with go/icons but we also should be consistent with the context - that is, where this icon is used in password manager it doesn\u0027t have any relation to vpn services. So we opened up a bug here(https://b.corp.google.com/issues/64551090) and requested to change icon name to just \"key\" instead of vpn key. And i am updating the name here to \u0027key.icon\u0027.",
