      "message": "So ScaleToEnclosingRect would break this layout test (external/wpt/css/css-transforms-2/transform3d-perspective-008.html). This test is ref-test and I assume rebaseline it could be hard since this is an external one. In this test, we scale 100*100 rect by 1.414 and enclosing would get a 142*142, leaving an edge on the side of the div.

I would rather use the same visible layer rect for all cases.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what the answer is in terms of the ref test (maybe we skip it? or something else?) but anything that involves layers that don\u0027t align to pixels exactly in a ref test is often going to be messy.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know that I\u0027m the right person to ask about this test.  Do you know who owns these?\n\nPersonally, I think it\u0027d be better to have both paths be consistent than to add rounding in one path.  I also don\u0027t think this literal edge case is spec\u0027d, so it\u0027s weird to have a ref test for it.  Maybe somebody who owns this test feels more strongly though.  Can you figure out who to ask?",
