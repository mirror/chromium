      "message": "This reads a bit worrying: accessing Dispatcher and calling methods on it. We assume this is OK since it only accesses dispatcher delegate. Maybe if we had AddWorkerData passed in the delegate (similar to |source_map|) and access it here to construct the binding system (by making CreateBindingsSystem static and letting it take the deleage param), it would be clearly documenting the subtlety. WDYT?",
