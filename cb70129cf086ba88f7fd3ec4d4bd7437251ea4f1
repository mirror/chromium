      "message": "The problem is when the shadow is in surface, the shadow_underlay_ window is added as a child window of host_window(),\nand the host_window() is used for creating the frame sink, and we submit composited frame to it. So the shdow_underlay_ will cover the all exo surfaces. To avoid this problem, we have to always add the shadow_underlay_ as a child window of the views::Widget, and put it below the host_window(). In future, we can remove it, and let code in android to create an extra underlay layer below all other layers.",
