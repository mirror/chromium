      "message": "FYI: this is a weird corner case, where the delegate actually decided to create a WebContents inside of ShouldCreateWebContents.\n\nHowever, AFAIK that behavior only happens from DriveWebContentsManager::ShouldCreateWebContents and for BackgroundContents (which is an app permission), so I think neither of those are spam/popunder risks. So I think we can probably leave it untouched.",
