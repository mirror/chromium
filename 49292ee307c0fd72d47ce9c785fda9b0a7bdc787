      "message": "On the native side we have 3 options: default, plan-b and unified-plan. The idea being that most clients would not be affected one way or the other and would leave it as the default. Clients which would be affected and cannot use Unified Plan yet would explicitly choose Plan B. Clients which have updated and wish to use Unified Plan can explicitly choose that too.\n\nI think the main difference is that we can switch the default for everyone sooner without having to wait for every client to update to Unified Plan. What do you think about exposing those same semantics here?",

      "message": "After thinking about it for a while, I think this is a good idea.\nThat allows the default behavior to be set in one place (WebRTC implementation).\nNote: I think we should adopt the principle that this parameter ONLY affects one thing: The format of the first CreateOffer if no previous SetRemoteDescription(remote offer) has been done. If the first SDP to be set has Unified Plan, the PC needs to go into UP mode no matter what, and if the first SDP has Plan B, it needs to go into Plan B mode.\nBut we should take that discussion to the transition plan document.",
