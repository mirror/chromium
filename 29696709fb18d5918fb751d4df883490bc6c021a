      "message": "Well, it might look a bit hacky because it is. :-)\n\nThe problem I had is that the decoded size is a member in the super class, but is modified in several subclasses. For CSSStyleSheetResource, this used to be in one place, but now - with the text decoding logic moved \u0027up\u0027 - it ends up being in two. So I changed it that either place that updates a member that changes the decoded size would do so by computing the size different and adding it.\n\nIt would probably be easier \u0026 cleaner if I just made DecodedSize() a virtual method, and then each subclass would have their own instance, taking into account its own members. I didn\u0027t initially do that because I wanted to keep the existing logic as much as possible. I\u0027ll try if it looks nicer...",
