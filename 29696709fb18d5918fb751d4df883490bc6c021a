      "message": "Well, it might look a bit hacky because it is. :-)\n\nThe problem I had is that the decoded size is a member in the super class, but is modified in several subclasses. For CSSStyleSheetResource, this used to be in one place, but now - with the text decoding logic moved \u0027up\u0027 - it ends up being in two. So I changed it that either place that updates a member that changes the decoded size would do so by computing the size different and adding it.\n\nIt would probably be easier \u0026 cleaner if I just made DecodedSize() a virtual method, and then each subclass would have their own instance, taking into account its own members. I didn\u0027t initially do that because I wanted to keep the existing logic as much as possible. I\u0027ll try if it looks nicer...",

      "message": "Updating DecodedSize() by deltas looks prone to error (e.g. https://crbug.com/570043).\n\n(Anyway, DecodedSize() is implemented in the current way just because it is used for MemoryCache size management (we need to update MemoryCache\u0027s current size when DecodedSize() is changed), which is now has much lower impact. So probably it\u0027s clearer to decouple decoded size from MemoryCache and make DecodedSize() virtual as suggested, and potentially even simplify it to bool HasDecodedData(). But this might require modest work and I expect this shouldn\u0027t block this CL)",
