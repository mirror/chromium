Reverting changes to this line achieves that, and solves ProxyConfigServiceLinuxTest.KDEFileChanged failures on my machine.\n\nNote: ProxyConfigServiceLinuxTest.KDEFileChanged has failed on other patches https://test-results.appspot.com/dashboards/flakiness_dashboard.html#testType\u003dnet_unittests%20(with%20patch)\u0026tests\u003dProxyConfigServiceLinuxTest.KDEFileChanged , so it probably has a race that is highlighted by your change (task latency is longer if the thread on top of the idle stack is detached).",
