Do you know where exactly the invalidation is coming from in the html/body negotiation logic? Can we add a similar invalidation in SVG-specific codepaths?",

This hack seems to be added for other reasons that no longer apply, but it became a piece of hard-to-remove legacy...\n\nI\u0027d prefer to avoid adding similar invalidation for SVGs. Background style are subject to adjustment when copied from the root element. It could be subtle. Also code duplication is bad in general.\n\nI forgot where the html hack was, but IMO we should remove that instead, if LayoutView learns how to invalidate itself...
