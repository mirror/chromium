      "message": "The link in your comment above points to comment #239 that talks about how |browser| should be constant, and that check has been added. \n\nI assume you are referring to the case when |window_id| might be set to kCurrentWindowId. I first understood your comment at line 179 \"window_id may be set to kCurrentWindowId, but that could still be acceptable, and |browser| may be changed below. A slight modification to this ...\" to refer to one change, but re-reading it now, I notice the two changes. \n\nDoes my new change correctly address the kCurrentWindowId case that you indicated?",
