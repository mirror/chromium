      "message": "One thing to consider here would be to use a factory method for creating a default/empty PhotoState like this. Factory methods for creating a PhotoState with defaults for all or most fields could be shared across several usage sites, e.g. [1][2][3]. Besides eliminating duplication this would have the advantage of reducing the risk of ending up with uninitialized fields in some usage sites whenever a new field is added to the struct.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/image_capture/image_capture_impl.cc?q\u003dmojom::PhotoState::New\u0026l\u003d28\u0026dr\u003dC\n[2] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/media/capture/video/mac/video_capture_device_mac.mm?q\u003dmojom::PhotoState::New\u0026l\u003d395\u0026dr\u003dC\n[3] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/media/capture/video/win/video_capture_device_mf_win.cc?q\u003dmojom::PhotoState::New\u0026l\u003d777\u0026dr\u003dC",
