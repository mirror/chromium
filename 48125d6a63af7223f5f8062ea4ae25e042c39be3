      "message": "Oops, I had meant to add a comment here saying that maybe this value should even be passed into CreateAudioDevice() from AudioDestination since it could be kFIFOSize - kRenderQuantumFrames. I took 8192 pretty arbitrarily since it\u0027s less than that value (right now) and \u003e\u003d the largest platform-specific audio buffer size. Otherwise I can just add a comment for now, WDYT?",
