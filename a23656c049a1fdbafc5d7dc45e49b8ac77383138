      "message": "The goal is to replace current sequences of operator + for string concatenation. Having each of those places need to supply a second argument of an empty string seems undesirable.\n\nThis patch started off as a function that takes many arguments (see patch 2) and in that case the two versions could not be unified.\n\nIf we do want to keep the initializer-list-only approach, it might be interesting to consider a default separator argument of an empty string piece. It would make the call sites larger which is not so great (I would expect thousands) but maybe not horrible. I am not concerned about performance at this level.\n\nIf we do keep them separate, I personally prefer StrCat since it matches a C concept. I called it this before I knew of the Abseil one.",

(i.e., StrCat just calls JoinString with \"\").\n\nWould that suffer a performance penalty due to processing the empty delimiter, versus this separate implementation?\n\nTo be clear, I think having StrCat that does not take a delimiter is great, especially since most call sites seem to pass \"\". It could just be an overload of JoinString though, instead of a separate method in a separate file with a separate implementation that is really just a special case. (An overload, rather than a default argument, would avoid bloating all the call sites.)",
