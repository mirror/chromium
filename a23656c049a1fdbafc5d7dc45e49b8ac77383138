      "message": "The goal is to replace current sequences of operator + for string concatenation. Having each of those places need to supply a second argument of an empty string seems undesirable.\n\nThis patch started off as a function that takes many arguments (see patch 2) and in that case the two versions could not be unified.\n\nIf we do want to keep the initializer-list-only approach, it might be interesting to consider a default separator argument of an empty string piece. It would make the call sites larger which is not so great (I would expect thousands) but maybe not horrible. I am not concerned about performance at this level.\n\nIf we do keep them separate, I personally prefer StrCat since it matches a C concept. I called it this before I knew of the Abseil one.",

The fact that StrCat happens to work with containers just like JoinStrings() is a detail of the current implementation.\n\nI\u0027m a bit confused by this. StrCat is exactly the same as JoinString with a default argument of \"\". Maybe you mean that the point is StrCat is typically called with a fixed-size initializer list while JoinString is typically called with a vector. I don\u0027t see that as a big differentiator, since both can be used either way.\n\nI\u0027d be happier to have JoinString moved into strcat.h, rather than its own file, since conceptually I think these functions are nearly identical. In terms of sharing implementation, it would be easier if they were in the same file, since you\u0027d want to share JoinStringT, not the public JoinString method.",
