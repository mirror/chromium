It\u0027s all platform-agnostic.\n\nThis CL doesn\u0027t add anything that would end up in a release; it\u0027s not complete enough to be useful for anything but waterfall tests.  We\u0027re working on open-sourcing more code, so Chromium could eventually support most of the Cast-related use cases Chrome supports now, but we don\u0027t yet have a timeline for when that might happen.",
