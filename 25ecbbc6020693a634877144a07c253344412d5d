      "message": "Sorry about the noise on this part, but I did some more research and I\u0027m pretty sure this is in violation of the styleguide :/ The Google Styleguide only allows static PODs (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Static_and_Global_Variables), and I didn\u0027t find anything in the Chromium style guide that makes an exception to this.\n\nThis means you have two options here:\n1) Turn this into a POD by using a C-style uint8_t[] array or a C++11 std::array\u003cuint8_t\u003e as return type.\n   + Maximally efficient, does not need dynamic initialization.\n   - A bit cumbersome to initialize and inconvenient to use, as there is no operator\u003d\u003d between an array and an vector.\n2) Return to the version of Patchset #1, i.e. use a non-static vector.\n   + Easier to initialize, more convenient to use.\n   - Not maximally efficient. However, given that this is a unit test, it should not matter too much.\n\nThe same applies below and to the GetTest* methods defined above.",
