      "message": "While rebasing, I removed the SetNumSlowPaths that was added to DisplayItemList since it can grab it from the PaintOpBuffer directly. This led me back here where I could remove the counting on the blink display items. I noticed this here which is returning 0 with a bug pointer. However PaintOpBuffer is doing something else in ClipPathOp::CountSlowPaths. So I copied this comment over there with a TODO to resolve that.. but if you have any thoughts that\u0027d be welcome.\n\nClipPathOp is doing this:\n\n  return antialias \u0026\u0026 !path.isConvex() ? 1 : 0;",

Regardless, the workaround is arbitrary and could be easily defeated by other veto paths - so I\u0027m all for removing the exception and doing the right thing in ClipPathOp.  LGTM",
