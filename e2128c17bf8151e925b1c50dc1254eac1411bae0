      "message": "Actually, I\u0027ve been told by tansell@ that the \u0027right\u0027 way to do this is to run it on the linux bot permanently, and deprecate the closure bot altogether.\n\nThe bots use gn analyze to figure out which targets need to build when a bot updates so this shouldn\u0027t be very expensive anymore. Further, this GN setup runs the closure compiler once per js_binary() target, rather than the n^2 setup we have currently with gyp.",

      "message": "My understanding from past conversations with @dbeam is that we don\u0027t want every developer who builds Chrome to have to setup and depend on Java. Only Android builds currently depend on Java. Are you sure that the larger chromium community will be OK with this?\n\nMy suggestion is to make small incremental steps, by switching our existing bot to use GN, without affecting Chromium builds otherwise. Once we feel confident about the performance we can re-consider, but I don\u0027t think this can be turned on without having a discussion about Java dependency for Win,Mac,Linux both on chromium-dev and chrome-eng-review.",
