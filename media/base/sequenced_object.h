// A SequencedObject is an object that lives entirely on one sequence.  The
// main idea is that a SequencedObject:
//
//  - is created, used, and destroyed from a single sequence ("impl sequence").
//  - is not easily passed to other sequences.
//  - supports "sequence hopping" callbacks easily.
//
// It cannot (accidentally) be passed between threads via callback, since
// raw / unique / weak pointers may not be included in the signature of any
// bound methods.  This restricts access to the object to its impl sequence,
// at least in many common cases.
//
// For example, the following will all fail to compile:
//
//   struct Foo : SequencedObject<Foo> {
//     void AnyMethod(int) { ... }
//   };
//   WeakPointer<Foo> wp;
//   base::BindOnce(&Foo:AnyMethod, &foo)  // Will not compile.
//   base::BindOnce(&Foo:AnyMethod, wp)  // Will not compile.
//
// What one may do, however, is use a SequencedWeakPtr for callbacks.  This
// will guarantee that the callback is run on the impl sequence, no matter
// where its Run() method is called from:
//
//   SequencedWeakPtr<Foo> swp(foo);
//   swp.BindOnce(&Foo::AnyMethod, 123);  // Will work fine.
//   // May post elsewhere and run, will post back to foo's impl sequence.
//
// Calling Run() on this callback will post to the thread on which |foo| lives.
//
// TODO(liberato): "and reply".
//
// If you want to send |foo| to another thread, it is also legal to bind a
// SequencedWeakPtr as a function / method argument:
//
//   void AnyFunction(SequencedWeakPtr<Foo> swp) { ... }
//   base::BindOnce(&AnyFunction, swp);  // Will work fine.
//
// SequencedWeakPtrs may be copied / moved by the receiver if desired.  The
// receiver may use them to generate new callbacks for |foo|, which will still
// post to the appropriate thread.
//
// In other words, the remote thread never gets the opportunity to post |foo| to
// the wrong thread, call methods directly on |foo| from the wrong thread, etc.
//
// If you'd like to create a SequencedObject that lives on a different sequence
// from yours, please see SequencedScopedRefPtr .
//
// Side note about swp.Bind methods:
//
// It's possible to make base::Bind(&Foo:method, swp, ...) automatically create
// a thread-hopping callback.  It's not terribly difficult to do, as long as one
// binds the method and the swp at the same time (e.g., Bind(&Foo::method).Run(
// swp, ...) is hard to fix.  maybe we need to override Run instead.).
//
// Do we want to do that, or is it too subtle?  Since one cannot easily create
// a non-thread-hopping callback via base::Bind (i.e. sending in a raw ptr or
// otherwise won't compile; they're already sending in a SWP), it seems like
// it's not too unexpected.  The only weird thing is that Run() becomes async,
// when normally Bind(...).Run() is not.
