      "message": "Adding exceptions here worries me, because it seems like this should be a simple question, or at least one that\u0027s answered elsewhere, so we could call a shared function. Listing exceptions here makes it likely we miss one.\n\nFor example, what is window.location.href in an interstitial? Except, apparently window.location.href *is* still the NTP (\"chrome-search://local-ntp/local-ntp.html\") after a navigation from the NTP to an interstitial. And it even keeps the security context of the previous page; for example, window.localStorage returns storage from the previous page\u0027s origin.\n\nSo I guess interstitials get a lot of permissions already that they maybe shouldn\u0027t, and that\u0027s considered OK and we trust themâ€¦?",
