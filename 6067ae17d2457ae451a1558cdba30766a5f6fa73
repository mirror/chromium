It seems desirable to leave this check as-is, since otherwise this would be a bug that would lead to crashes (see https://crbug.com/751916 or https://crbug.com/751920).  Since we should never add processes with empty site URLs into the site-process trackers, the rest of the logic should ensure that we don\u0027t place an empty site URL into a process with a different StoragePartition.",
