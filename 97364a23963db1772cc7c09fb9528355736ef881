      "message": "It looks like this would still use ANIMATION when the prop change for the last time during an animation? If that\u0027s the case, then wouldn\u0027t it be more useful to have a separate value for that? For example, SET, ANIMATION_IN_PROGRESS, ANIMATION_COMPLETE. Or, maybe just STILL_ANIMATING, NOT_ANIMATING?",

      "message": "Yes, I initially thought about that, but it involved more refactoring since the code that changes a property (e.g. https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/compositor/layer_animation_element.cc?l\u003d177\u0026rcl\u003d3f6c980434d478741a819d0cc1372ae0b1f66d59) doesn\u0027t necessarily know if the animation is ending (t\u003d1 doesn\u0027t mean that the animation is ending if is_cycling is true). Since my goal is to land WindowOcclusionTracker as soon as possible, I would like to stick with the solution that we agreed on at https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome-tmt/nTBgFpPlEGQ\n\nIf you want, I could add a TODO.",
