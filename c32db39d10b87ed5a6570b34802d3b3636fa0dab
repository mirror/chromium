AutofillClient receives two notifications: about mouse click and focus change. They are triggered by different sets of cases. Not sure whether we can merge them into one.\n\nI\u0027ll add autofill folk. \n\nRoger: is it possible to replace WebAutofillClient::DidCompleteFocusChangeInFrame and WebAutofillClient::DidReceiveLeftMouseDownOrGestureTapInNode with one method? Seems either methods are about focus changes.",

For example, don\u0027t trigger on mousedown and not on focus change, since you can tab into the window to give it focus without generating mousedown.",
