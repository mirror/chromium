      "message": "Why not use a covariant override of GetRenderWidgetHost() here (as happens with GetRenderViewHost()).\n\nThis works great in these test classes, with one exception: either TestRVH gets to know that TestRFH is an RFHImpl, or TestRFH gets to know that TestRVH is a RVHImpl, but you can\u0027t have both classes doing mutual covariant overrides using the derived type of the other -- one of TestRFH, TestRVH (and now TestRWH) has to be declared first, and you can\u0027t forward-declare the inheritance relationship.\n\nSo what we did, was to put the TestRFH at the bottom of these dependencies, so that it can use TestRVH and TestRWH for covariant overrides.",
