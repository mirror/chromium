I guess I should be doing something like:\n\n  if (is_mac \u0026\u0026 use_fuzzing_engine) {\n    configs -\u003d [ \"//build/config/gcc:symbol_visibility_hidden\" ]\n    configs +\u003d [ \"//build/config/gcc:symbol_visibility_default\" ]\n  }\n\n\nBut I cannot find a proper place for adding that. That needs to be applied to all executable targets or source sets. It might doable via src/build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn, but that file doesn\u0027t import anything, and we cannot check whether use_fuzzing_engine is true or not.",

      "message": "Right, this would be better to do with adding/removing configs. The right place to put it would be in build/config/BUILD.gn under executable_config, but the symbol visibility configs live as part of the default_compiler_configs, so I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be able to -\u003d it. I\u0027d maybe ask brettw@ or dpranke@ what they think.",
