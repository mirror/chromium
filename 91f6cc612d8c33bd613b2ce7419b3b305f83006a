      "message": "I briefly considered implementing |Set| through |SetPath|. A sample implementation could look like this:\n\n\n  Value* Value::Set(StringPiece path, std::unique_ptr\u003cValue\u003e in_value) {\n    return SetPath(SplitStringPiece(path, \".\"), std::move(*in_value));\n  }\n\nHowever, since DictStorage currently still contains unique_ptrs, SetPath necessarily would need to call make_unique before inserting the value in the Storage. We can\u0027t make use of the fact that Set already has access to a unique_ptr and thus always need to do an extra memory allocation. Given the widespread usage of Set I decided this is not acceptable, even if delegating to SetPath would be much cleaner.",
