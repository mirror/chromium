This would cause the actual Service instance (and therefore anything it owns) to be destroyed, which might be sufficient to simulate a network service crash.\n\nAny interfaces implemented by the Service without ultimately being *owned* by the Service may however remain functional. e.g. anything using a StrongBinding on the Network Service side, we\u0027d have no way of tearing down.\n\nThis may or may not really be an issue, so it might be worth trying?",
