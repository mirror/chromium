      "message": "nit: after seeing how confused we were by this, it might be worth expanding on the comment, maybe something along the lines of:\n\n\"This method is used to handle assert failures when asserts are enabled by //build/android/bytecode:java_bytecode_rewriter. For non-official builds, this is always enabled and assert failures will result in an assertion error being thrown.\n\nFor official builds, this is only enabled when report_java_assert \u003d true. Assert failures will result in an error report being uploaded to the crash servers only if the callback is set (so that this can be a no-op for WebView in Monochrome). This also means that asserts hit before the callback is set will be no-op\u0027s as well.\"",
