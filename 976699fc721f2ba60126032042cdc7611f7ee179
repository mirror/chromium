      "message": "Probably reasonable to move these, if that\u0027s what //base OWNERS prefer.  //base/test has test utilities for lots of other subdirectories of //base, so I think we\u0027d just assumed this was the right place for these files when they were added.\n\nI\u0027ll go ahead and land this CL as-is for now, but will keep in mind that it might be nice to move these files out eventually.  Thanks!",
