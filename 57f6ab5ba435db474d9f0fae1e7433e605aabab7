      "message": "A question for bokan@: is the LayoutPoint-to-FloatPoint conversion okay here?  I think LayoutPoint was introduced to avoid float\u0027s loss of precision at a high page offset (e.g. infinite scroll).  May be we don\u0027t care about fractions here?\n\nThis general applies to all/most other FloatPoint() uses below.",
