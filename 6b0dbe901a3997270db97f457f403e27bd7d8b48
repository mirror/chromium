      "message": "FWIW, I think we could potentially remove the need for both host and URL constants. As follows (example):\n\n 1) Delete kChromeUIAboutHost, keep kChromeUIAboutURL.\n 2) Replace all usages of kChromeUIAboutHost (https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q\u003dkChromeUIAboutHost\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026type\u003dcs), by using GURL EqualsIgnoringRef(), see https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/url/gurl.h?gsn\u003durl\u0026l\u003d410.\n\nOverall, maintaining constants of both the full URL (scheme+host) and the host seems redundant, when GURL already provides ways to extract both scheme and host separately.",
