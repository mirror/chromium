      "message": "If you want shutdown to proceed even if there\u0027s a pending file dialog then you need CONTINUE_ON_SHUTDOWN (I know the nomenclature is confusing, it comes from the old SequencedWorkerPool and will be reworked after we get rid of some shutdown issues that make us even require 3 states).\n\nCONTINUE_ON_SHUTDOWN is the loosest shutdown mode in that it skips tasks on shutdown but also doesn\u0027t block shutdown if the task is in progress (SKIP_ON_SHUTDOWN blocks shutdown if the task is in progress). CONTINUE_ON_SHUTDOWN comes with a caveat that you must not use any global/static/non-Leaky Singletons state as your task may still be running after main() unwinds and those things have been uninitialized.",
