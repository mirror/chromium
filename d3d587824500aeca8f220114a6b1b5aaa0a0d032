      "message": "It took me a few seconds to verify that top/bottom zone rects are correct. It would have been easier to see if you had this at the top of the function:\n\ngfx::Rect top_rect(0, 0, size.width(), kFadeoutZoneHeight);\ngfx::Rect bottom_rect(0, size.height() - kFadeoutZoneHeight, size.width(), kFadeoutZoneHeight);\n\nand then you could also use those rects when creating the gradients instead of duplicating \"height - kFadeoutZoneHeight\" logic. Your call. Changes look good otherwise.",
