      "message": "high-level question: what do we use the bluetooth address for? right now, i think (but could be wrong) that it\u0027s used for notification IDs and for doing a substring match against ui::TouchscreenDevice\u0027s path.\n\nif that\u0027s correct, would it be simpler to always just use the full, raw device path for notification IDs, and only extract/reverse the bluetooth address in IsStylusDevice()? that seems like it could make the code simpler -- we could have an e.g. ExtractBluetoothAddressFromBatteryPath() function that only gets called by IsStylusDevice().",
