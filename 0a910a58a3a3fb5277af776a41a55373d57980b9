      "message": "I did some refactoring: BulletedView in extension_install_dialog_view and the literal in sad_tab_view are both factored out (kind of) now, but the table_view \"grouping indicator\" is some whole other thing that can span multiple rows, so I left it as-is. I favored drawing the circle directly as an SkPath over using a views::Label since my impression is that text rendering is quite expensive compared to raw canvas ops.",
