      "message": "In the case of synchronous NotifyFinished(), this (and probably other callers of SetResource(FooResource::Fetch(...))) causes slight behavior change: GetResource() was null previously, and it\u0027s non-null now.\n\nPreviously, the call order was:\n1. ScriptResource::Fetch() -\u003e ResourceFetcher::RequestResource()\n2. Inside SetResource():\n2a. Set ResourceOwner::resource_\n2b. AddClient() -\u003e possibly synchronous NotifyFinished()\n3. Just after SetResource() call.\n\nAnd, if NotifyFinished() calls ClearResource() (this is the case here, see WorkletScriptLoader::NotifyFinished() below), ResourceOwner::GetResource() returns null in Step 3.\n\nAfter this CL, the call order would be:\n\n1. Inside ScriptResource::Fetch():\n1a. ResourceFetcher::RequestResource()\n1b. AddClient() -\u003e possibly synchronous NotifyFinished()\n2. Inside SetResource(), set ResourceOwner::resource_\n3. Just after SetResource() call.\n\nClearResource() in NotifyFinished() is done in Step 1b BEFORE SetResource() (to non-null) in Step 2, and thus ResourceOwner::GetResource() returns non-null in Step 3.\n\nCandidate fixes would be (I don\u0027t have a good idea for now though):\n- Fix ResourceClient-side code to handle the new call order correctly (but I feel this can complicates the logic further),\n- Make AddClient() always async, or\n- Keep the old call order ... but how? the code like below would keep the old call order, but AddClient() calls would be de-centralized (ResourceFetcher::RequestResource() and ResourceOwner have separate AddClient() call sites).\nResourceOwner::FetchAndSetResource(params, fetcher, client) {\n  resource_ \u003d FooResource::Fetch(params, fetcher, nullptr);\n  client-\u003eAddClient(resource_, fetcher-\u003eGetTaskRunner());\n}",

The Resource is anyway kept alive until notification, via ResourceLoader, or Persistent in the task created in AddClient().\n- Replace GetResource() with the resource pointer supplied in NotifyFinished()-family.\n- Store the resource pointer only when RemoveClient() is needed.\nThis further hides Resource pointers around Fetch() (probably this is good, because loader code can have more exclusive control on Resources before notifying clients), but not sure whether relying further on the Resource pointer supplied by NotifyFinished() is a good idea or not.",
