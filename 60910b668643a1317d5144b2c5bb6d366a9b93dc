      "message": "I tried this for the test_support target in [1], but got a compile error as the linker was told to create a static library without input sources. The logs have been pruned since, unfortunately.\n\nFor the message_center_unittests target it means we\u0027d continue to create an executable that doesn\u0027t do anything for Mac and iOS `all` builds. That seems less desirable than having a conditional in targets that may have to depend on them.\n\nI can remove the conditional in this file, of course. Would you be OK with adding an \"assert(enable_message_center)\" to the top of them, to avoid accidental dependencies?\n\n[1] https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/559391/1/ui/message_center/BUILD.gn",

      "message": "imho empty message_center_unittests targets are kind of nice, because then you can add them to testing/buildbot/*.json files independently of toggling the feature.\n\nI\u0027m not sure I understand where in this file you want to put the assert. Like so:\n\ntest(\"m_c_unitt\") {\n  if (enable_message_center) {\n    assert(enable_message_center)  # trivially true\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nor like so\n\ntest(\"m_c_unitt\") {\n  # defeats purpose of unconditionally defining target since people\n  # depending on it now still need to check for enable_message_center\n  assert(enable_message_center)\n  if (enable_message_center) {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\n?",
