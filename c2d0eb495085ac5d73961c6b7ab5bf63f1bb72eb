      "message": "If we write this enum (and the one following) to disk, we will be forced to hold their values constant forever. If we choose to do that, we should add big scary warnings to the enums. Otherwise, we should do an intentional conversion between the enum we use internally and how we represent it serialized (be it an integer, a string or something else).",
