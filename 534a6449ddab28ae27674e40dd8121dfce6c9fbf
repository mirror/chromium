      "message": "You could use libprotobuf-mutator (kind of like is done here https://github.com/google/libprotobuf-mutator/blob/master/examples/xml/xml.proto#L91) to define the input you want mutated as containing \"data\", \"property_id\", and \"parser_mode\" instead of using bytes from data or hashes to do this, but it\u0027s up to you. I\u0027d be more than happy to help if you\u0027d like to do that.\nThere\u0027s a guide on libprotobuf-mutator here (https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/testing/libfuzzer/libprotobuf-mutator.md) if you\u0027re interested.",

      "message": "I\u0027d like to know what Marty thinks about this, but I think it would be better to dedicate the 0th element of data to deciding the mode (eg parser_mode \u003d data[0] % blink::CSSParserMode::kNumCSSParserModes) rather than looping through each mode.\nThis code does what I have in mind: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/testing/libfuzzer/fuzzers/string_tokenizer_fuzzer.cc?l\u003d27",
