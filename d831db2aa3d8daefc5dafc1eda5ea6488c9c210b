      "message": "Our npot texture check is probably failing on desktop GL. we should fix that. the important part is that it works on Chrome OS devices where we use this. I think it\u0027s best to keep the DCHECK for now and file a bug about fixing detection of npot texture on desktop.",

      "message": "this is expected. --use-gpu-in-tests will produce different results compared to sw mesa for some tests. the only thing we care about when using that switch is that GLRendererPixelTest.DISABLED_TrilinearFiltering passes (or the result is something that reflect working mipmaps). We should try to uprev sw mesa to a more recent version where GenerateMipmap works but I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s a huge effort.",
