      "message": "FYI, http://bit.ly/snav2 (currently under review) takes another approach to fix this bug:\n\nIt always considers iframes (and scrollable areas) as focusables (without checking their content). By doing so we can avoid the \"dig into a new container\"-step that the current implementation does. Plus, snav2 does not need the extra stack or skip list that this CL introduces...\n\nIf/when we do snav2, we will need to change the expectation here, but that\u0027s fine... (Currently snav2 is blocked on crbug.com/585413).",
