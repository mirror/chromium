      "message": "Let\u0027s leave it in. At this layer the only thing I\u0027m worried about is whether the various lookup functions pull in the right maps in the right order, and that the maps don\u0027t contradict each other. To that end it\u0027s good to have sanity tests around even if they look redundant :-). As far as the //net change is concerned, this test is sufficient.\n\nHowever, the real tests for this particular issue would be to verify that extension:// URL requests for .json files reliably receive the correct content type.",
