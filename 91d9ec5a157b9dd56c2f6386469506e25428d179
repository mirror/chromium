      "message": "Hmm, that\u0027s actually kind of bothersome. This component is going to depend on //device/geolocation and on the Device Service for the core of its functionality, is that correct? If so, I think we want to just not have it be built on iOS until we bring up that functionality on iOS. Otherwise it will probably just break on iOS when you start building out its functionality.",
