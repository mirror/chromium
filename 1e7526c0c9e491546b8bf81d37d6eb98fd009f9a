But that\u0027s going to be a larger CL, so I wanted to at least decouple the infrastructure parts. The point of this CL is to see if an architecture where we have a KeyedService in //components that is dependent on UserEventService makes sense. But I also didn\u0027t want to land a completely empty component, so I added a prototype of the local consent recording, which is the secondary goal.\n\nFor that reason, I\u0027d like to keep it. And it\u0027s going to be used in the next CL.\n\nBut I do understand the principle of not landing unused code, so if you insist, I can remove it too.",
