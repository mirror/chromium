      "message": "Overall this change looks good. It\u0027s pretty much just a code move plus cleanup.\n\nThis (and similar code throughout this patch) only checks the first fragment. Can you refresh my memory about the final design for this? Will all fragments share the same properties here, or can they be different? Is the plan to iterate over all fragments here?",

      "message": "Fragments will in general have different property tree nodes, and also local border box\nproperties, content properties, etc.\n\nExample: consider a two-column layout with a child that has a transform, and is fragmented\ninto two pieces. We\u0027ll allocate two transform nodes, one for each fragment. Any fragmented\nchildren of the transform that have a a transform will also parent to their containing\nfragment.\n\nFragments will also end up with their own paint offset I think, but that hasn\u0027t been\nimplemented either yet.\n\nRegarding \"FirstFragment\" usage: each of these is in general wrong, I\u0027ll need to fix them\nin future patches.",
