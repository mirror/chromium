# depot_tools for Chromium development

depot_tools provides a set of cross-platform tools for managing the
Chromium software development cycle.

This directory pulls together wrappers around, and (for some platforms)
pre-built binaries of, various necessary tools.

The intent is to try to make things "just work" for individuals
participating in Chromium development, while also supporting uprades
of these tool and wrappers without any action on the developers's parts.

Trying to make things drop-dead-simple for the developers causes the
process of making changes to *these* tools and wrappers themselves to
be a little more complicated.  This is a good tradeoff, but it means
you need to follow directions.  In particular, DO NOT EDIT FILES IN
THE PUBLICLY-VISIBLE DIRECTORIES IN-PLACE.

Directory Layout
================

  linux/
  mac/
  win/

    These are the publicly-visible "bootstrap" directories that we
    expect people who already have Subversion installed to sync directly
    to get started.  These are just thin wrappers that call into the
    utilities in the release/ directory, after possibly updating
    their contents from the publicly-visible URL.
 
    DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THESE DIRECTORIES DIRECTLY.  Make changes to
    the underlying files underneath the src/ directory and follow the
    procedures to update these directories and check in the results.

  release/

    This contains the publicly-visible directories that get updated
    by the wrappers, to keep the toolchain up-to-date without any
    explicit action on the developer's part.

    DO NOT EDIT THINGS IN THIS DIRECTORY DIRECTLY.  Make changes to
    the underlying files underneath the src/ directory and follow the
    procedures to update this directory and check in the results.

  bin/

    Utility scripts for working on these depot_tools:  managing our
    process of building the publicly-visible directories from
    the underlying src/, and making the contents visible by checking
    in the updates.

  doc/

    Various design documents describing what's going on here.

  src/

    THIS IS THE DIRECTORY IN WHICH YOU SHOULD MAKE CHANGES.
