Should |capture_time| be incremented for each loop, like you did for the other platform glue?",

      "message": "nit: As I\u0027ve been cleaning up time code elsewhere in the code base (recent fixits), I\u0027ve been adding a comment and DCHECK() when we assume a platform timestamp is from the same clock as TimeTicks\u0027, mostly for documentative purposes. Example: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/ozone/platform/drm/gpu/drm_device.cc?rcl\u003d9cd680e72a411c5a565098251d42863c43aef17f\u0026l\u003d100\n\nIMHO, this is not an issue in Win/Mac code since base::TimeTicks provides a QPC/MachAbsoluteTime converter for that; and using those methods makes the code self-documented.",

      "message": "Thinking a bit about this: What happens if you use base::TimeTicks instead of the int64_t here? I could be misunderstanding something, but since these are direct read/writes on shared memory, it should \"just work\" right? This would save you from having to convert in AudioInputSyncWriter.\n\nGranted, I can see a concern about whether base::TimeTicks\u0027 internal representation is changed to something other than POD in the future (e.g., a pointer to some other struct), which could break this code. Either way, I\u0027ll need to consider this serialization use case in my fixit crbug (getting rid of To/FromInternalValue()).",
