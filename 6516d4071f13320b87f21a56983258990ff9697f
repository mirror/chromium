      "message": "Fullscreen means that the buffer covers the screen fully.\nWhy would you remove the check that the size is the same as the render pass output_rect? \n\nThe SingleOnTop strategy should pick the video quad when it\u0027s not covering the fullscreen.\nWe can then remove the background if it\u0027s all solid color with another strategy as I suggested in the other CL.",

      "message": "In this case, the buffer covers the screen fully. the removal part is the unnecessary restriction of scaling.\n\nThe below remained condition guarantees the buffer covers the screen fully.\ngfx::ToRoundedSize(candidate.display_rect.size()) !\u003d render_pass-\u003eoutput_rect.size())\n\nThe below removed condition checks if scaling is needed.\nrender_pass-\u003eoutput_rect.size() !\u003d candidate.resource_size_in_pixels\n\nAtomic commit can support scaling by hardware. After this CL, 720p video or 4k video can be overlayed in 1080p screen.",

      "message": "Sorry, I confused this CL with crrev.com/c/685748\nI think we should continue down that path.\nThe OverlayStrategyFullscreen is used mainly for android apps, when we have a fullscreen app that matches exactly the screen size. In that way we can use the android app buffer for scanout directly.\n\nWe use this strategy on old boards withot drm atomic.\nI\u0027m afraid we\u0027d break those with this change.",
