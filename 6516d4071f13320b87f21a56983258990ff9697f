      "message": "Fullscreen means that the buffer covers the screen fully.\nWhy would you remove the check that the size is the same as the render pass output_rect? \n\nThe SingleOnTop strategy should pick the video quad when it\u0027s not covering the fullscreen.\nWe can then remove the background if it\u0027s all solid color with another strategy as I suggested in the other CL.",

      "message": "In this case, the buffer covers the screen fully. the removal part is the unnecessary restriction of scaling.\n\nThe below remained condition guarantees the buffer covers the screen fully.\ngfx::ToRoundedSize(candidate.display_rect.size()) !\u003d render_pass-\u003eoutput_rect.size())\n\nThe below removed condition checks if scaling is needed.\nrender_pass-\u003eoutput_rect.size() !\u003d candidate.resource_size_in_pixels\n\nAtomic commit can support scaling by hardware. After this CL, 720p video or 4k video can be overlayed in 1080p screen.",
