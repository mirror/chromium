I\u0027ve been discussing this with haraken@ because for LayoutTests we have code to automatically only activate bindings used for tests when tests are running but have no similar mechanism for browser_tests.\n\nThis logic mimics the behavior of the old bindings which included test functions with the regular interface.",
