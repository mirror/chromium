      "message": "Makes sense but please make it clear in the comment that these are only for tracing. Also add a TODO in PlatformPrivateFootprint. We are close to a state where we don\u0027t need all this split between RawOSMemDump and PlatformPrivateFootprint, and PlatformPrivateFootprint should just be merged into RawOSMemDump.\n\n\nAlso maybe we should discuss with @erikchen if still makes sense showing these columns in tracing with the consistent memory metrics or not. I guess these reflect more what activity manager reports?",
