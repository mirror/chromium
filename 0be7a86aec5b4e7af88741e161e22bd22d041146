We\u0027re verifying that they\u0027re not stripped off by the applyConstraints/getConstraints cycle, even though they can\u0027t be satisfied or make no sense. It\u0027s testing the conversion machinery in Blink, not the application machinery in content.\n\nNote: I was a bit surprised to have to move aspectRatio and frameRate into this section; I expected frameRate to work with applyConstraints.",
