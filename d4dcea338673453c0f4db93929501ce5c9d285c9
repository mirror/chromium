      "message": "I figured that since you pass real url here anyways, there is no point in hiding it from the embedder. In my case, I\u0027d like to trigger site isolation for a particular group of URLs, say \"http://localhost:8000/inspector/extensions/resources/*.html\".\n\nOnly after that I discovered that SiteInstanceImpl::RequiresDedicatedProcess() passes site_ url there anyways, so it does not help me. Is this as designed? Do you have a recommendation for me provided the use case?",

      "message": "What happens if require_dedicated_process_pattern_ is non-empty and we are on Android?\n\nBecause then we will potentially hit a case where DoesSiteRequireDedicatedProcess() returns true -- creating an OOPIF -- but AreCrossProcessFramesPossible() returns false. This is likely to cause CHECK failures in renderer processes, as well as correctness issues (e.g. because RenderFrameHostManager::OnDidAddContentSecurityPolicies is gated on AreCrossProcessFramesPossible())",
