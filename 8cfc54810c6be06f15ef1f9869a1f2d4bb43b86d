However, checking the selection at the beginning of a command doesn\u0027t seems so...\n\nIf we reach here with an invalid EndingVisibleSelection(), it means someone has constructed an invalid InsertTextCommand, which should be fixed.\n\nCould you add a note above L150 that:\n\n// TODO(editing-dev): We shouldn\u0027t construct an InsertTextCommand with none or invalid selection.\n\nThanks!",
