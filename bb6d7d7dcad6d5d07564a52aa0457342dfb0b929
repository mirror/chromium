Since this is only used in tests I figured it is fine to not depend on Undo Manager here and introduce another set of UndoOperation sub classes. What do you think?",

If it\u0027s taking a full second to delete passwords we should try to improve how fast we add/remove them.\n\nAlternatively, we can be optimistic and remove the password from the list and show the toast. We\u0027ll need to make sure we handle these events in the right order. I\u0027m not familiar w/ the password manager code, so not how how hard/easy it is to do that. This will let the UI feel fast even if the actual deletion of the password is taking a second.\n\nAdding the callback is also an option, to make sure nothing went wrong if we\u0027re being optimistic. What kind of errors are we likely to find when deleting a password? Am I over thinking this?",
