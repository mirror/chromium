      "message": "As stated in the comments this is pretty much a poor mans Undo Manager that only really works when deleting passwords and exceptions are not mixed. Since this is only used in tests I figured it is fine to not depend on Undo Manager here and introduce another set of UndoOperation sub classes. What do you think?",

This seems a bit confusing to me, but I couldn\u0027t find a better way for now. Would it make sense to add callbacks to removeSavedPassword in order to address this issue?",
