This flag being set to true indicates that an animation is in progress.\n\nsuspended_animation_: Is true if the page is currently hidden, in which case we do not want to animation loops to run.\n\nSo we want to receive the begin frame signal (which triggers an animation frame) only when both of these conditions are met: 1) an animation frame is requested (implicitly by the promise returned by commit) and 2) animations are not suspended.",
