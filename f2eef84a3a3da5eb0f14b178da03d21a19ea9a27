As we add more flags and some patterns start to emerge, that could be a moment to introduce concepts like this. If we do so now, it\u0027ll likely influence the future additions, which might not be optimal.\n\nIn order to resolve this, I suggest starting a discussion on chromium-dev. If the community is broadly in favor of this, I\u0027d also be fine. Otherwise, maybe we could keep things granular for now and reevaluate this later.",
