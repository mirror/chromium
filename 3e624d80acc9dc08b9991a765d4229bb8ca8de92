      "message": "I\u0027m not sure about the keyframe requirement. The webm spec only says that clusters *should* start with a key frame. It may occur that the next cluster doesn\u0027t start with a key frame, but causes the estimated duration of the previous cluster\u0027s tale to increase. In this case, if that next cluster were removed and then later re-added to abut the the same estimated tale, you might fail this check.",

      "message": "From offline chat, for posterity included here: the case being solved by this method is specific to [Can]AppendBuffersToEnd, as called by [Can]AppendRangeToEnd. In the normal continuous-by-dts case, a nonkeyframe would already be continuous (as determined by frameprocessor continuity), so wouldn\u0027t be somehow made to reside in a separate range that begins with a nonkeyframe. All ranges (and new coded frame groups following discontinuity) begin with keyframe. Any intervening explicit remove impacting an in-progress GOP will cause dropping of nonkeyframes until next keyframe in SBS::Append, too. Hence, scoping to just keyframe here focuses on the edge case being solved.",
