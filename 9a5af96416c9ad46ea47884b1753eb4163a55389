      "message": "Oh, this is interesting. I don\u0027t have a good sense of how this combines with enable_native_notifications but I do know that I had lots of problems on Win7 when I tried to include this lib (without the enable_native_notifications qualification). Support for this lib is only in more recent versions of Windows and I suspect some of the mysterious problems on the win7_chromium_rel_ng bot is because of this. Good news is that my previous CL probably allows you to leave this dependency out altogether. \n\nCan you tell me the linker error (or others) you get when you remove runtimeobject.lib from this list?",
