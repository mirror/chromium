      "message": "This is definitely better phrasing.\n\nBut regarding \"within 24 hours\": In practice, we have a very high percentage of commits that are upstreamed very quickly -- for example https://crrev.com/c/535085 was upstreamed in ~20 minutes -- and some number of commits that require manual intervention and would be stuck until somebody manually closes the PR.\n\nDoes \"within 24 hours\" still seem like a good thing to put here?",
