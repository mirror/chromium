      "message": "Of the options I tried, this seems the most reasonable. I tried adding plumbing to invalidate the bitmap and set the toolbar as \u0027ready for capture\u0027, but I would still need to remove the check for Android O since this happens on other platforms. I can add a todo to remove this down the line; this is one of many issues that I believe can be fixed by doing an in-memory reparent of the tab rather than relying on the intent system. This is easier to merge though. Thoughts?",

      "message": "I think this seems fine, but can you describe why the current system doesn\u0027t work?\n\nAre we not getting new draw calls?  Is the invalidate check not working?  Are we invalidating but saying the toolbar can\u0027t be recaptured?  It would be good to know what about the current system is broken and document that in the CL comment.",
