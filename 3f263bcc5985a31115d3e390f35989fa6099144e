      "message": "Of the options I tried, this seems the most reasonable. I tried adding plumbing to invalidate the bitmap and set the toolbar as \u0027ready for capture\u0027, but I would still need to remove the check for Android O since this happens on other platforms. I can add a todo to remove this down the line; this is one of many issues that I believe can be fixed by doing an in-memory reparent of the tab rather than relying on the intent system. This is easier to merge though. Thoughts?",
