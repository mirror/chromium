      "message": "the need for this to be a WebContentsObserver just to get destroy seems sad to me.\n\nI feel that WebContentsUserData should have a destroy method in java that you\u0027d get notified of there (similar to the destructor in C++).  Having to do this referencing seems rather unfortunate IMO.\n\nAnd if we do need the observer, I feel it should live on the same side as the user data.\n\nThat being said, this does exactly fall into the case I was worried about.  We have the niceties of the user data on the java side, but the ugly-ness of an explicit setter on the C++ side.  I feel it would be better if the C++ was also able to pull this out of the user data (granted this would likely need to be a user data on the C++ side that has one on the java side...I\u0027m not 100% sure that is the worst thing in the world, but I do worry about this somewhat mixed behavior being the gold standard for how this is handled)",
