So this does not really work well.\n\nI think another option would be to do the following: add a LogoutHelper observer interface in GaiaCookieManagerService with a method named CleanupBeforeLogout(calllback) and a setter method named SetLogoutHelper. The AccountConsistencyService would implement this interface and would set it as the helper when it is initialized.\n\nDavid: In terms of architecture, is it better to go through the client, or would you prefer the helper as I suggested above.",
