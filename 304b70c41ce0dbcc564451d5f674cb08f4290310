      "message": "Ken or Tom: is there a better way to check that this is a network service than checking the sandbox flag?\n\nOr maybe this is moot because once the sandbox is enabled, we will pass the directory handle/certs through mojo and we can take it out?",

      "message": "If we\u0027re going to use a production sandbox, eventually we won\u0027t have access to the path with the test cert, so this will need to change, at some point, regardless.\n\nThis is just intended as an interim hack that will presumably eventually go away, so I can land my proxy CLs from a couple months back, before I get back to SimpleURLLoader.",

      "message": "I suspect for certs we may need a mojo interface to inject a cert verifier in the production interface (And we will normally run in the network process, for performance).  Then we can use globals or something to inject one with test certs (Or add test certs after it\u0027s been started).  But no one\u0027s working on that, currently.",
