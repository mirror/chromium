Does that make sense?\n\nI noticed that you have got debugging code like AssertURLRequestPresent(). I wonder whether that is related to a recently-fixed memory corruption. I commented in the bug report. The Mojo team (and many others) also spent a lot of time on a memory corruption issue likely sharing the same root cause.",
