      "message": "I don\u0027t like the promotion of NotificationType to be in base:: directly. It implies that it\u0027s a top-level thing, not that it\u0027s a part of ObserverList.\n\nIt would be great if it could be named something like base::ObserverList::Notification::EXISTING_ONLY, though the reason you hoisted it from the class was that you wanted to drop the template parameters here. Maybe base::ObserverListNotification::EXISTING_ONLY?",
