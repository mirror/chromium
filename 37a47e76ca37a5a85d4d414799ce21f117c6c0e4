If we\u0027ve got A(B_focused,C), and C navigates to B, it\u0027s not necessary to tell B since its FocusController already knows the first subframe\u0027s LocalFrame has focus.\n\nThis might still send extra IPCs in rare cases (e.g., A(A_focused,B,C) and C navigates to B - B\u0027s process should already know about the A_focused RemoteFrame being the focused frame), but I think that\u0027s ok.",
