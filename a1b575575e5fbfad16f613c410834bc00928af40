      "message": "nit: this first sentence doesn\u0027t really tell what this class does (but tells what it wants to be), this could probably more plainly document what it does. E.g. \u0027Implements a resource queue with which the caller (i.e. ResourceFetcher) can append and retrieve resources to throttle/schedule resource requests.  Currently this just works as a simple FIFO queue with a credit system that controls how and when next resource can be dispatched.\u0027 ...or something like that?\n\nCan you also document the \u0027credit\u0027?\n\nBy the way this doesn\u0027t look a \u0027dispatcher\u0027 to me, rather it\u0027s basically a queue?",
