      "message": "FROM_HERE binds to a location in a file. If you use a helper function such as this one in order to post, your FROM_HERE points back to that function, rather than to the original call location.\n\nI can\u0027t think of a clearer way of commenting this without significantly losing brevity. Even as it currently stands, I\u0027m not sure the comment deserves to be in the code.\n\nWdyt?",

      "message": "There are only two places from which this call can come (and that\u0027s by design, so it shouldn\u0027t change):\n1. Direct user input (chrome://webrtc-internals -\u003e create dump -\u003e RTC event logging). In that case, I think it\u0027s reasonable to let the user save those files anywhere he wishes. Or do we suspect Chrome might have permissions that the logged-in user doesn\u0027t?\n2. Outdates JS hooks that are only accessible from Google domains (pinging @terelius for confirmation), that\u0027s nobody currently using. We intend to remove these. We can land the CL that removes this before, if you think it\u0027s a security issue, but otherwise, I\u0027d prefer to do it after.",
