That is, does CHECK(source_text_.IsNull()) crash?\n\nIsNull() asserts that source_text_ is not set by ScriptResource::SourceText().\nIsEmpty() additionally allows source_text_ is set to an empty string in SourceText().\nIf you intentionally allow empty cases, could you add a comment that when/why source_text_ can\nbe empty?",

      "message": "Done.\n\nI did that on purpose, because I saw that some code would set source_text_ to an empty string. (ScriptResource::DestroyDecodedDataForFailedRevalidation)\n\nI now tried with IsNull() and indeed no test breaks. Looking back, apparently nobody calls CheckResourceIntegrity after DestoryDecodedDataForFailedRevalidation. That makes perfect sense given the names of those two functions, so I fixed it. :-)",
