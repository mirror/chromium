      "message": "I\u0027d prefer if this CL actually used this method in production code.\n\nRight now, it is unclear how this will be used in production code, so it\u0027s somewhat hard to say if it is being used the correct way. I won\u0027t push back on a multipart CL, but if it\u0027s possible to add something that consumes this in production code in this CL I\u0027d be a little more confident this is implemented in a good way. As far as I can tell, this is doing the right thing, but I just want to avoid re-writing parts in later CLs.",
