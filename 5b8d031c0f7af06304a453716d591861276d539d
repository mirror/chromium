      "message": "Hmm I didn\u0027t expect you to move both targets into test.  If you\u0027re doing this, I guess just keep it all in components/download/BUILD.gn: unit_test and get rid of test.  I thought you were just going to move \"components_unittests_gtest_filter\" in there.  I actually like pulling the various components/download/...:unit_tests targets into one inside components/download though.  Good idea, just move it back up a directory.  Sorry for all of the churn/back and forth while we figure this out.  Thanks!",
