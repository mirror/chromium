I think transient is a clearer name and having a named member for the set of transient elements will make the code pretty easy to read here, too, and reduces the risk of making a mistake in the enum.",

      "message": "talked offline. use opaque and translucent to avoid confusion to mode such as kModeVoiceSearch. Also, I added a IsOpaqueUiMode function with a switch statement instead of using a std::set. This way we could make sure that we don\u0027t forget about update the function after we add new translucent ui mode. I think it is slightly better. WDYT?",
