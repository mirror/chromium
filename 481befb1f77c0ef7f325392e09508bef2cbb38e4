      "message": "Sorry I missed this before, I think we should make this a standalone function local to this file. No need to make it a class method. src_dir_ can just be bound in as one of the args when posting the task to invoke it. We could also call it BindDirectoryInBackground or something.\n\nThis makes it clear that: a) it\u0027s done on a background sequence and b) it has no real dependency on the ZipFileCreator instance lifetime.\n\nI *think* this also means ZipFileCreator no longer has any reason to be ref counted (looks like it will only be used on the main thread), but I may be overlooking something there.",
