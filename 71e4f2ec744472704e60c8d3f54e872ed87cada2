      "message": "This comment is confusing to me. -g0 is literally the same as not passing -g at all. It means you don\u0027t get debug info (you still get a symbol table). no_symbols now strings symbols, but again at link time, which is the same \"write too much, then remove it later\" thing we had up here earlier.",

Adding -s to ldflags removes all symbols including function name in no_symbols.\nBut I want to keep symbol_level\u003d1 for buildbot\u0027s args.gn for representing we keep function symbols for stacktrace.",
