      "message": "Yeah, reading through the new patch set, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027d prefer the following:\n1) SetSelectionModel always sets has_directed_selection_ to false, no flag plumbing needed.\n2) ResolveDirectedCursor just flips the selection as needed, hopefully stays inlined in MoveCursor.\n(aside: flipping via just x coords is incorrect for multiline, but that\u0027s tangential)\n3) MoveCursor should just set has_directed_selection_ true as needed as its last operation.",
