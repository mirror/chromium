      "message": "Are you confident that all viewport script scrolling goes through these two methods\n(window.scrollBy and window.scrollTo)?\n\nI am pretty sure you can scroll window via document.scrollingElement as well.\nFor example document.scrollingElement.scrollY\u003d10; should scroll the window. Here is\nwhat comes to my mind:\n1. document.scrollingElement.scroll{Top,Left}\u003d\n2. document.scrollingElement.scroll{By,To}()\n3. potentially scrollIntoView\n\nI checked (1) and it should go through the LocalDOMWindow methods but (2) goes\nthrough Element::ScrollFrameBy which bypassed LocalDOMWindow. Didn\u0027t check (3).\n\nSo, can you make sure we know all possible routes to scroll window and account\nfor them. Perhaps we don\u0027t care about some of them but at least we should know\nwhat we are ignoring.\n\n\nI was thinking whether we can actually move this recording inside ScrollableArea itself (i.e, viewport-\u003eSetScrollOffset()) and record this flag when kProgrammaticScroll is set but\nunfortunately we are using kProgrammaticScroll for more than just scripted scrolls.",
