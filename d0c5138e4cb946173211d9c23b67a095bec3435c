      "message": "I was considering that, but since it isn\u0027t (sometimes, per comment on method declaration) I went with something else. Happy to discuss (and change) this though, if there\u0027s a prefix that would make this more obvious in general. (I guess not having a prefix could work too, but \"size\" is a bit overloaded - especially when we\u0027re close to the resource.)",

      "message": "Can the \"intrinsic\" SVGImage size ever be non-integral i.e. by having a non-integral width/height on the SVGImage tag?\n\nI\u0027m concerned because I am planning to switch the return for ImageSize to be a FloatSize so that we do not get discretization errors when inverting the zoom factor in background images. I don\u0027t want there to be issues with SVGImage not giving consistent answers for ImageSize and NaturalSize if the former returns FloatSize.",

      "message": "Yes, it can be non-integral, but that is currently not allowed by our (various) interfaces.\n\nFWIW, I\u0027m planning on doing away with ImageSize (fold it into the ImageSize methods on layout/paint related objects which wrap this object.) I imagine that if you want to return FloatSize all the way down from Image, and then rounding here probably doesn\u0027t make much sense, but at higher layers/callers? Anyway, there will need to be auditing per call-site (as can be seen from this patch already, some users are ints while others are floats. I\u0027d be happy to help/discuss this further.",
