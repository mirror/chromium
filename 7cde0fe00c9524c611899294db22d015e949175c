      "message": "Below you\u0027re casting this to a uint32_t to write, but you\u0027re treating it as a size_t up here?\n\nThat said, we probably could have smaller limits on images than \"fits in a uint32_t\".  Do we have any limits in the image controller (or elsewhere in Chrome) on the size of images we\u0027ll deal with?",

      "message": "This function has some \"using unassigned variable\" problems.  Reader might not do anything if it\u0027s already run out of memory to read, so width/height/pixel_size etc might all be unassigned.\n\nI think you likely need to check if the reader is valid before handing them to SkImageInfo::Make.  Similarly, ExtractReadableMemory could return null.  Not sure if SkPixmap copes with that or not.\n\nPaintOpSerializationTest.DeserializationFailures in an asan build will find all these for you once you hook up image serialization/deserialization more thoroughly.",
