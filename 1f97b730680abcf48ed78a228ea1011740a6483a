      "message": "Hmm!  I could, but then it would make stuff like std::move(result.task) impossible because that would leave the TaskResult in an inconsistent state.\n\nMy belief here was that a TaskResult is a short-lived object with few callsites that construct it.  One option would be to fixup callsites that modify it post-construction and make need_unref const?",
