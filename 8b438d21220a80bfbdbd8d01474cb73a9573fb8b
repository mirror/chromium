I haven\u0027t thought of a good solution, but one option would be to record a separate histogram on commit (for all commits but the first).\n\nWe\u0027d lose some information in fast renderer shutdown cases, but that would let us figure out if recording this metrics at onLoad is reasonable.",

      "message": "Recording on page load is surely too early. Ideally we should be able to record small scrollers which are composited so the results could exclude the non-composited ones. After all, the memory save is only from not compositing the currently composited ones. But at this moment we don\u0027t have the compositing state information.\nWouldn\u0027t recording on commit be fired too often? I wonder whether that metrics is dependent on other user behaviors.",
