      "message": "This is similar to the rule right after it, which raises two questions for me:\n\n(1) The next line says dotless j isn\u0027t allowed anyway.  If that\u0027s accurate, don\u0027t we only need to disallow dotless i + combining mark here?\n\n(2) Also, the next line talks about \u0027l\u0027 as well.  Do we need to disallow \u0027l\u0027 + combining mark?",

      "message": "#1) You\u0027re absolutely right. I forgot that. I\u0027ll remove U+0237 from the new condition. Thanks for spotting it. \n\n#2) The point of this CL is that \u0027dotless i\u0027 + accent cannot be distinguished from regular i + accent and there is no reason to add an accent to \u0027dotless i\u0027 instead of a regular \u0027i\u0027.   In case of \u0027l\u0027, there\u0027s no such pair (dotless i and regular i). \n\nA more general case of LGC + U+03xx accent is considered in \nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d727092 . This CL has a narrow focus on purpose.",
