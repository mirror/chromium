      "message": "Thanks Eric; I took a look at the existing CRLSet test and it looks straightforward, but I\u0027m not familiar with the tooling used to create the data files (in this case an appropriately-constructed CRLSet), so I think it\u0027s probably better for you to take care of it and make sure it\u0027s done properly - sorry.",
