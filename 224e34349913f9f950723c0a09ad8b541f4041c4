      "message": "Good catch.  I\u0027m adding SpdyNetworkTransactionTest.GoAwayImmediately to check this.  Turns out that since https://crrev.com/199633019, creating a SpdySession does not fail with any error if a GOAWAY frame is received, only an actual request can fail.  So the best place to test for this error code is a SpdyNetworkTransactionTest, not a SpdySessionTest.",
