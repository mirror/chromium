      "message": "I tested it with an older Xbox One gamepad. It didn\u0027t work, because that gamepad was ALSO not recognized. We were previously only checking for the 2013 Xbox One gamepad (045e:02d1) but not the 2015 version (045e:02dd). We\u0027re also missing the Xbox One Elite (045e:02e3) but I don\u0027t have one to test with yet.\n\nOnce I added the 2015 controller the initialization worked fine. I noticed that 360Controller (an unofficial third party Xbox gamepad driver for Mac) uses slightly different data in the initialization packet, and sends another packet before it:\n\nhttps://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/blob/master/360Controller/_60Controller.cpp#L527\n\nI think this extra packet has to do with initialization of the Xbox One Elite. I\u0027ve ordered one, once it comes in I\u0027ll investigate this further.",
