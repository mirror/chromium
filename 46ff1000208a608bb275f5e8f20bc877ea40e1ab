      "message": "I\u0027m having a bit of trouble following this test. I could see an explanation of the form:\n\n// Frame 0 - No visible damage, but invalidated because no history.\n// Frame 1 - No visible damage, but invalidated because no history.\n// Frame 2 - No visible damage, not invalidated because |damaged_frame_limit_| frames of history.\n// Frame 3 - Visible damage, invalidated as a result.\n// Frame 4 - Visible damage, invalidated as a result.\n// Frame 5 - Visible damage, invalidated as a result.\n// Frame 6 - No visible damage, but invalidated because of recent damage in the last |damaged_frame_limit_| frames.\n\nIs this accurate?\n\nThe two \"2\"s below seem related to |damaged_frame_limit_|, are they not? And the \"frame \u003e\u003d 3 \u0026\u0026 frame \u003c (damaged_frame_limit_ + 3\" seems like \"frame \u003e\u003d |damaged_frame_limit_| \u0026\u0026 frame \u003c damaged_frame_limit_ * 2\"?",

      "message": "Hm, this is related to your other comment about |damaged_frame_limit_|. I think/hope damaged_frame_limit_ \u003d 3, for example, means that we do the early damage check whenever any of the last 3 frames had damage. It doesn\u0027t mean that we need 3 frames of damage before we start the check.\n\nI was trying to figure out if your explanation above worked: if the explanation for Frame 2 was right, then you\u0027re right, we\u0027re really talking about Frame |damaged_frame_limit_ - 1|. So the test should fail if we bump |damaged_frame_limit_| up, but I just checked that the test still passes with a higher |damaged_frame_limit_|.\n\nSo really, I think Frame 2 has no visible damage and is not invalidated because *a* frame within the last |damaged_frame_limit_| had no damage. What I don\u0027t understand is why Frame 1 invalidates - I attributed that to setup. Is it possible that Frame 0 has visible damage, or a way to check that in the test?\n\nSo here\u0027s where I\u0027m at (the way you wrote it out is really helpful):\n// Frame 0 - ??? Maybe there is visible damage here.\n// Frame 1 - No visible damage, but invalidated (makes sense if all the frames before had visible damage).\n// Frame 2 - No visible damage, not invalidated because one of the last |damaged_frame_limit_| frames (Frame 1) had no visible damage.\n// Frame 3 - Visible damage, invalidated as a result.\n// Frame 4 - Visible damage, invalidated as a result.\n// Frame 5 - Visible damage, invalidated as a result.\n// Frame 6 - No visible damage, but invalidated because all of the last |damaged_frame_limit_| frames had damage.",
