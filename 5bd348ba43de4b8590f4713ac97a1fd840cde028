Is it always the same VideoFrame should call TakeSanpshot() and Undo()? If yes, maybe we can record the VideoFrame ID (frame.unique_id()) when TakeSnapshot() was called and verify that this Undo() is called for the same VideoFrame. WDYT?",

      "message": "\u003e Maybe early return if |rect_| is empty?\n\n|rect_| should never be empty, unless Undo() was called without a prior TakeSnapshot(). Even if that happens, nothing breaks/crashes here (just a no-op).\n\n\u003e And does |rect_| need to be cleared after Undo finishes to avoid the accidental re-using of it? ...\n\nIt will be up to the caller of these methods to make sure the right |frame| is being \"un-done.\" I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary to add any additional runtime checks to ensure something that is the responsibility of the caller. That, and the header file comments make it pretty clear that it\u0027s on the caller to do the right thing.",
