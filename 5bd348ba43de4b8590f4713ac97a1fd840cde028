      "message": "Maybe early return if |rect_| is empty? And does |rect_| need to be cleared after Undo finishes to avoid the accidental re-using of it? Is it always the same VideoFrame should call TakeSanpshot() and Undo()? If yes, maybe we can record the VideoFrame ID (frame.unique_id()) when TakeSnapshot() was called and verify that this Undo() is called for the same VideoFrame. WDYT?",
