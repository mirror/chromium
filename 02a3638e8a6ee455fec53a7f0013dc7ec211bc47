If you look at earlier versions of the patch I actually did that as well (I even wrote a test!). But then decided to just keep it to one change at a time.\n\n\u003e Actually, looking at that list of transitions [1], I feel like a whitelist (rather than blacklist) would be more appropriate.

Also we probably want tests for all the remaining types. I have a WIP patch that reduces the size of tests quite a bit and I would like to land that before writing ~10 new tests. Is that OK?",
