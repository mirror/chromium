Most of those look like they shouldn\u0027t open the app. Very roughly, I think the following transition types should stay within the browser:\n\n- TYPED\n- AUTO_SUBFRAME\n- MANUAL_SUBFRAME\n- GENERATED (Omnibox suggestions)\n- AUTO_TOPLEVEL ???\n- FORM_SUBMIT\n- RELOAD\n- KEYWORD\n- KEYWORD_GENERATED\n\nThe only remaining ones are LINK and AUTO_BOOKMARK. So I think positively check for those instead.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/base/page_transition_types.h",
