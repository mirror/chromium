      "message": "sorry, yea, FocusableBorder was a bad suggestion. Have been out of this particular code too long so I forgot. I\u0027m thinking\n\n1) a focus painter would be good\n2) CreateSolidFocusPainter (the non deprecated version) with empty insets\n3) CreateSolidFocusPainter should probably default to a thickness of 2 and empty insets. The 2 constant is unfortunately in ash/ right now but all CreateSolidFocusPainter call sites seem to use it, so we could just default to 2 or even remove it.",
