      "message": "Think of Internals as an extension of WebContentsImpl. In the future, it\u0027s going to hold other objects that\u0027s used on chrome as well. Or another way to think is that, it should be ok to move the existing members like mEventForwarder and mSmartClipCallback into Internal as well.\n\nSo the Internals object needs to be tied to a specific WebContents on construction, and not lazily created from setInternalsHolder. And you will need a Holder for the case when embedder does not call setInternalHolder. That one can just hold the Internals object strongly though.",
