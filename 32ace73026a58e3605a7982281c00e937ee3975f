      "message": "Yes, this is absolutely necessary. This is the enum value which informs observers that a GATT connection was actually attempted and differentiates this attempt from one in which there was no response from the remote device at all.\n\nHowever, you\u0027re right that wording is unclear here - this proves that a GATT connection was *attempted*, but not necessarily established (e.g., if there was an error creating the GATT connection). I\u0027ve changed the enum value to STATE_CHANGE_DETAIL_GATT_CONNECTION_WAS_ATTEMPTED for clarity. What we really want to track here is whether we actually tried a connection vs. received no response at all.",
