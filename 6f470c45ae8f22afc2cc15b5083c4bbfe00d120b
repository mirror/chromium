      "message": "One of the reasons we have this code here is we have tried to structure code such that code in chrome/browser does not refer to code in the c/b/ui/platform-specific-directory. You can see a similar structure to this in c/b/ui/views/chrome_browser_main_extra_part_views. This patch results in more dependencies between chrome/browser and c/b/ui/ash. I tend to think the right thing is to rename c/b/ui/views/ash to c/b/ui/views/chromeos (or c/b/ui/chromeos).\n\nNone-the-less I think the code in ChromeBrowserMainExtraPartsAsh should stay where it is at.",
