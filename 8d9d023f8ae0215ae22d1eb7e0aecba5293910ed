Something like:\n\n SSLConfigServicePref calls this function when any of the\n prefs it uses changes. tls13_variant is one of these, so it should\n trigger notifications. This change should be a no-op. These prefs\n are set based on:\n\n - Field trials (n/a because field trials set default values)\n\n - Command-line flags (n/a because command-line flags are set\n   early enough to not need a change signal)\n\n - Admin policy (n/a because tls13_variant is not attached to\n   any admin policies)",
