      "message": "Ah, I think I understand the problem and why I am confused. There are *three* registration paths:\n* Chrome starts and registers shelf prefs it owns\n* Ash starts and registers those shelf prefs as foreign\n* Ash test starts and needs to register those prefs as local\n\nThese are mapped into two functions, which is confusing. I think we need an API that makes these three cases explicit.\n\nAlso, chrome is calling into a function that isn\u0027t in //ash/public/cpp when running in mash, which we want to avoid. (It was doing that before via ash::Shell::RegisterProfilePrefs, but I wasn\u0027t thinking about it clearly when I wrote that.)\n\nI think we should centralize pref registration in a single file in //ash/public/cpp, like add utility functions to ash_pref_names.cc and possibly rename it to ash_preferences.cc. Prefs are effectively system-wide global variables that are part of the interface between services, so I think they should live in //ash/public.\n\nI\u0027m going to try patching in your CL locally to see if I can come up with something that looks like this.",

It seems to register the same prefs twice. But you know the prefs code better than me -- I guess it\u0027s OK to do that? Add a comment explaining why?",
