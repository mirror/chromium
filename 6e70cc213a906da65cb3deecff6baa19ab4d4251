      "message": "Is \"true\" the value we always want to pass for unpack_premultiply_alpha? I\u0027m guessing that you\u0027ve already tested passing \"false\" and it caused tests to fail, but I\u0027m surprised that we do any manipulation of the ImageBitmap\u0027s data during upload. The point of ImageBitmap was that all of the operations like Y-flip, premultiplying alpha, etc. were done during construction of the ImageBitmap.",

      "message": "It\u0027s not doing manipulation about the premultiply_alpha value here; the CopyImageToTexture() function inverts the unpack_premultiply_alpha and unpack_flip_y values in call to CopySubTextureCHROMIUM, specifically catered to the texImage2D from canvas. Because I merge the function with that by TexImage2D from imagebitmap, I can to hardcode a value \"true\" here to invert it to \"false\" in CopySubTextureCHROMIUM.\n\nAs I move on with this Issue, I think I got to deal with this flipY and premultiplyAlpha values again; if there\u0027s anything wrong in conformance tests, that might be revealed again. I will follow up this in emails.",
