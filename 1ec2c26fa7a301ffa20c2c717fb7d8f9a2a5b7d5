      "message": "Yes, I agree the naming is confusing.  Unfortunately, renaming an enum type is not backward compatible and will be frowned on during log reviews.  Alternatively, I can create a separate Enum type and a separate field for it.  However, given the metric is temporary, I would prefer to leave it as is if you don\u0027t have strong objection.",
