      "message": "Optional nit: Calling this here scatters a bit the calls to the metric. Should this be internal to the reauthentication module and here we\u0027d call:\n[_weakReauthenticationModule skipReauth];\nor something similar?\nOr is it classic in Chromium code to scatter histograms like this? I miss high-level view on that, so I defer to you or Robert.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not aware of any explicit guidance on whether calls to the same metric should be in the same file. I chose to scatter those to keep the histograms closest to the reported event in code. I would find the skipReauth message on the reauth module a little confusing.\n\nHaving said that, if Robert has a different guidance, I\u0027m happy to adjust the code to match it.",
