Just to clarify, \"pinch-zoom/page scale\" is the zooming we do on pinch-zoom and doesn\u0027t in practice affect the CSS pixel size.

It\u0027s a matter of terminology since Android doesn\u0027t have browser-zoom today but I suspect these should really be DIPs, i.e. physical / DSF, so are you sure this shouldn\u0027t be 1 / dip_scale?\n\nAlso, Bo might know better, but do we generally use DIPs or Physical Pixels in UI code? Depending on that, it might make more sense to perform this conversion at the point of use in UI code.",
