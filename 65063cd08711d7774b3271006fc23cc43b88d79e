      "message": "a bit more on this: one issue is that a WebContents may be destroyed prior to ThreatDetails being destroyed since ThreatDetails is not bound to the lifetime of a WebContents. This means that the done_callback may be invoked with a NULL WebContents, which means that TriggerManager can\u0027t find the right entry to clean up in its map.\n\nI guess there are two ways to address things. 1) tighten things up (make sure AllDone is always called, and all objects live long enough for that call to finish) or 2) loosen things up (make each step cancellable, let things disappear independently and be resilient to that).\n\nTightening-up seems tricky with all the thread hopping ThreatDetails currently does, which is why i\u0027m leaning towards loosening up these relationships. Would love everyone\u0027s thoughts on this.",

      "message": "I feel like having really clear ownership would be simplest, which I think would mean having something like AllDone() be guaranteed to be called.  It\u0027s a sort of \"Delete me now\" call (Or \"delete me soon\" if it needs a thread hop). That way you have precisely one place where the ThreatDetails d\u0027tor gets called.\n\nThe AllDone() func could pass a ptr to *this if web_contents is no good (since it could be null), and TriggerManager could have a set of those ptrs just for ownership.\n\nYou know this code better than I, so feel free to discount my ideas with reality.",

      "message": "tl;dr; I think the CL as-is will help the crashing situation, so I\u0027m inclined to submit in the interest of time and do another pass in a separate CL. I did add a dcheck to ensure AllDone gets called after FinishCollection is called, which may also aid in debugging if further crashes occur.\n\nI played around with using |this| in the AllDone callback in addition to WebContents to handle that corner case, but too much of trigger manager relies on WebContents being the key into its map, so without a webcontents available it\u0027s hard to tidy up properly. So for now I\u0027m keeping the logic to discard threatDetails as soon as the webcontents goes away. The one possible case where this might fail is if we tell ThreatDetails to finish up and WebContents is destroyed while ThreatDetails is working. TM will cleanup that TD, which may work (TD stays alive due to refcounting) or crash (as per the existing crashes). But I hope this CL will at least improve the situation.\n\nThe next pass will involve making ThreatDetails non-ref-counted, which will force us to manage lifetime much more accurately and address more of the holes we\u0027ve discussed. I think that change will be a bit more involved, and may undo some of the changes in this CL.",
