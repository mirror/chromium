      "message": "This feels better suited to live in lock_window.cc, since it is dealing with ui/ash configuration. It is a bit of a hard-call, I\u0027m thinking the blur code should also be moved to lock_window.cc, or maybe we have a separate file for the random initialization that needs to happen.\n\nIf moved to lock_window.cc then the SetKeyboardOverscrollOverride calls in webui_screen_locker.cc can be removed, as webui lock screen uses LockWindow. Feel free to remove the calls and add the tests in a follow-up CL if you\u0027re concerned about patch size w.r.t. merging.",

      "message": "Moved code to lock_window.cc\n\nTest and removal will come in a follow up cl.\n\nI agree that blur code could/should be moved under control of lock screen. I discussed it with Colin as well. I would wait for the visual review (http://crbug.com/793171) and move if as a part of lock screen transition revamp (probably not M64).",
