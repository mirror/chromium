      "message": "This feels better suited to live in lock_window.cc, since it is dealing with ui/ash configuration. It is a bit of a hard-call, I\u0027m thinking the blur code should also be moved to lock_window.cc, or maybe we have a separate file for the random initialization that needs to happen.\n\nIf moved to lock_window.cc then the SetKeyboardOverscrollOverride calls in webui_screen_locker.cc can be removed, as webui lock screen uses LockWindow. Feel free to remove the calls and add the tests in a follow-up CL if you\u0027re concerned about patch size w.r.t. merging.",
