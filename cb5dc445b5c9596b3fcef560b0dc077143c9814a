      "message": "If we focus on replacing TestBlinkWebUnitTestSupport rather than deprecating Platform::CreateURLLoaderMockFactory, this should be at least FetchTestingPlatformSupport of platform/loader/testing/ or something. Ditto for other ScopedTestingPlatformSupport instances.\n\nFetchTestingPlatformSupport also replaces scheduler backend with one for testing, but it may not work for webkit_unit_tests, and should not be needed.\n\nProbably, you may want to add MockedURLLoaderTestingPlatform in core/testing or core/loader, and use it in webkit_unit_tests?",
