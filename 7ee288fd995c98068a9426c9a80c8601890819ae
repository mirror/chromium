      "message": "Although I have raised the issue, you might have to rush this patch as soon as possible. If so, please ignore my previous comment at this time. (But we should fix it later before shipping at least)\n\nBTW, adding isCancelled() here seems a bit strange.\nThis callback is a response to the request from browser to renderer.\nOn the other hand, this function looks requesting from renderer to browser.\n\nWe already have a mojo IPC connection to request from the renderer to browser, so I recommend using it. As I remember, it was defined in PaymentManager.\n\nSyncing the status to PaymentManager in browser side when the associated payment request is cancelled. Then, we can query the status after adding this function to PaymentManager.",

      "message": "Agreed that this might a little bit not ideal, that\u0027s why I renamed this class. Thought to maintain the callback separately but looks not good for this reason.\n\n\u0027Syncing the status to PaymentManager\u0027 looks even stranger to me under current structure since it is dedicated to manager payment instruments registration/unregistration. And we have difficult to uniquely identify a payment request instance, note that |payment_request_id| is not necessary unique among all payment requests and can be reused.",
