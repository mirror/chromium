(But we should fix it later before shipping at least)\n\nBTW, adding isCancelled() here seems a bit strange.\nThis callback is a response to the request from browser to renderer.\nOn the other hand, this function looks requesting from renderer to browser.\n\nWe already have a mojo IPC connection to request from the renderer to browser, so I recommend using it. As I remember, it was defined in PaymentManager.\n\nSyncing the status to PaymentManager in browser side when the associated payment request is cancelled. Then, we can query the status after adding this function to PaymentManager.",
