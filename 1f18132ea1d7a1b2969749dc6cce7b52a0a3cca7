      "message": "FWIW, I think this is a neat way for a story to specify extra flags to add remove. Maybe the code above in WillRunStory can be moved all the way up to the original SharedPageState so that all stories can use it too? The specific way in which that bit is implemented can later change to add validation and prevent flag conflicts as Caleb and Ned describe on their doc.\n\nAlso note, since these are class variables, we can compute the flags statically without creating the story, this way some form of validation could also be done as a presubmit step.\n\nw.r.t. naming, on the Java side there already are @CommandLineFlags.Add and @CommandLineFlags.Remove [1]. Maybe these should be {ADD/REMOVE}_COMMAND_LINE_FLAGS to keep some consistency?\n\n\n[1]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/testing/android/docs/instrumentation.md#annotations-that-affect-how-a-test-is-run",
