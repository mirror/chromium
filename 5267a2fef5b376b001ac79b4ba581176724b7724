      "message": "Excellent question.\n\nIt should not lead to hang because  SpdySessionPool::CloseCurrentSessionsHelper() calls SpdySession::CloseSessionOnError(), which calls SpdySession::DoDrainSession(), which sets spdy_session.availability_state_ to STATE_DRAINING.  (Unless for some weird reasons some callbacks keep creating newer and newer SpdySessions, see comment in header file for SpdySessionPool::CloseAllSessions()).\n\nHow about adding a DCHECK to CloseCurrentSessionsHelper() to make this a little bit more transparent?",

      "message": "Sure, I can write something like this in spirit.\n\nNote that CloseCurrentSessionHelper() should not be called within a for loop, because (according to the comments for CloseCurrentSessionHelper() and CloseAllSessions() in the header file) there might be a possibility for SpdySession::CloseSessionOnError() to open up new sessions.\n\nWhat I just did is not equivalent, but probably close enough.  Unless, of course, in the course of closing sessions, a new session is created and made unavailable but not draining immediately (that is, STATE_GOING_AWAY).\n\nIn any case, CloseCurrentSessionHelper() needs to be called at least once, even if |available_sessions_| is empty.\n\nI think I would still prefer patchset 4, but I\u0027m happy to change it.\n\nAlso, I do not believe that new sessions could be created by CloseCurrentSessionHelper().  Maybe it\u0027s worth adding a DCHECK for that?  I\u0027ll do that in a follow-up CL.",
