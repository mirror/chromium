      "message": "Excellent question.\n\nIt should not lead to hang because  SpdySessionPool::CloseCurrentSessionsHelper() calls SpdySession::CloseSessionOnError(), which calls SpdySession::DoDrainSession(), which sets spdy_session.availability_state_ to STATE_DRAINING.  (Unless for some weird reasons some callbacks keep creating newer and newer SpdySessions, see comment in header file for SpdySessionPool::CloseAllSessions()).\n\nHow about adding a DCHECK to CloseCurrentSessionsHelper() to make this a little bit more transparent?",
