      "message": "\"in process\" is a little bit confusing. We use it in a few places, and it makes discussions difficult (e.g. there\u0027s in-process ozone, etc.). Looking at the code, it looks like this specifically affects cursors/resources. So maybe this could be renamed to be more explicit about that? e.g. |should_initialize_resources|. In fact, we probably don\u0027t even need this to be set? The code can check if |resource_runner| is set, and make decisions based on just that?",
