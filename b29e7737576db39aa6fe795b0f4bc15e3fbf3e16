      "message": "\"in process\" is a little bit confusing. We use it in a few places, and it makes discussions difficult (e.g. there\u0027s in-process ozone, etc.). Looking at the code, it looks like this specifically affects cursors/resources. So maybe this could be renamed to be more explicit about that? e.g. |should_initialize_resources|. In fact, we probably don\u0027t even need this to be set? The code can check if |resource_runner| is set, and make decisions based on just that?",

      "message": "We also use this to set up screen manager forwarding. It seems unclear to me to tie that to resource loading. I changed things to use Service::running_standalone_ (which the old code used), which eliminates \"in-process\" from this class. I also eliminated |in_process| from the cursor loader helper class. That OK?",
