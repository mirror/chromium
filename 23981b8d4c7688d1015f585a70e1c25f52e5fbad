      "message": "This is my own ignorance, but what updates the surface layer in the SurfaceLayerBridge? I would have expected that a change here would also require a change there, but maybe that\u0027s backwards.\n\nDoes this code https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/platform/graphics/SurfaceLayerBridge.cpp?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d131 get called from the browser when you submit a frame with a different local surface id or do you need to make that update yourself?",
