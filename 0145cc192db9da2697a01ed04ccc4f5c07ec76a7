It would be great if we can support this.\n\n\u003e Alternatively, we could disallow EnableIf from taking a value, under the theory that any mojom file should be using only one EnabledIf unique flag value to disable any needed definitions in the same file. I\u0027m open to alternatives as well.\n\nI imagine that it is convenient sometimes to use multiple values in a file, for example:\nstruct Foo {\n  [EnableIf\u003dis_win]\n  int win_specific_field;\n  [EnableIf\u003dmac_not_ios]\n  bool mac_not_ios_specific_field;\n};\n\nI understand that we could have different Foo defintions in two files, one is used for is_win and the other for mac_not_ios. But it seems easier this way to see the common and platform-specific fields.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "This was actually somewhat intentional--the idea is that even if someone uses EnableIf inside enum definitions, the enum values themselves should be stable (since they are sometimes used in UMA histograms).\n\nOne alternative is to fold this into AddComputedData, but it\u0027d make things a lot more complicated: it would make enumerator values particularly tricky. Note that even without fixing this TODO, you\u0027ll still end up with a compile error (just a less helpful one).",
