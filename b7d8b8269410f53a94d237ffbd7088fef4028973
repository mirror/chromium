      "message": "That\u0027s a problem.  We\u0027re going to need to figure out what to do here.  The problem is we don\u0027t want consumers to be subject to socket pool limits, and that\u0027s the only way to avoid them.  But we presumably don\u0027t want to co-opt the shared HostResolver, which respects priorities.  Not currently sure what to do here.",

      "message": "It depends on how many requests socket_host_tcp makes at once.  If it makes more than 32 total, or more than 6 per host-port-pair, this will significantly affect behavior, since we\u0027re now respecting socket pool limits.  We\u0027d be better off using MAXIMUM_PRIORITY and LOAD_IGNORE_LIMITS than using MEDIUM priority, I think.  I don\u0027t know how many requests this makes, or to how many domains, so have no way of gauging the impact of either option.",
