      "message": "This seems a bit fragile. If the construction of the night light client were to become asynchronous this could break.\n\nI would prefer to either use HasSwitch(ash::switches::kAshEnableNightLight) directly here, or move that logic into a static NightLightClient helper, e.g. IsNightLightEnabled() and use that both here and where NightLightClient is constructed.\n\nAlso, NightClientClient? :)",

      "message": "oops\n\nWe already check the flag in more than one place, which is also fragile imo because flags are notorious for being flipped around, i.e. default switches and --enable becomes --disable, or both flags exist with a default that depends on some other factor, etc. So a helper function is preferable, but it would have to go in ash/public/cpp to concentrate all the flag checks in one place, which is annoying because it would necessitate a very short utility file. Thoughts?",
