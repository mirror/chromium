      "message": "This seems a bit fragile. If the construction of the night light client were to become asynchronous this could break.\n\nI would prefer to either use HasSwitch(ash::switches::kAshEnableNightLight) directly here, or move that logic into a static NightLightClient helper, e.g. IsNightLightEnabled() and use that both here and where NightLightClient is constructed.\n\nAlso, NightClientClient? :)",
