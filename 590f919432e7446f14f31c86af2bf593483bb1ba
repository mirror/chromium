      "message": "It\u0027s pretty clearly not true at the moment that all non-system notifications will have a user profile, but I agree with \"should\" here and hopefully the NOTREACHED will help flush out the exceptions.\n\nJust from a little poking around I found inconsistencies like the a11y notifier (which I think appears when you enable chromevox) [1] which uses type APPLICATION, a system notifier id, and no profile id. I also happened to find recently that profile_id gets filled with different things in different places, e.g. email or user name, luckily user name apparently (usually?) \u003d\u003d email.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ash/system/tray_accessibility.cc?rcl\u003d04278134435eb551fa5d513b77bf8c32a32375a9\u0026l\u003d495",
