Let\u0027s call this static method SetGeolocationGlobals() or something like that to avoid confusion.\n\nIn the slightly longer term, it seems like there would be no reason for the GeolocationProviderImpl instance to be a singleton anymore compared to being an ivar of the Device Service? In that world we could just pass these variables to the GeolocationProviderImpl constructor and wouldn\u0027t need these globals at all anymore.",
