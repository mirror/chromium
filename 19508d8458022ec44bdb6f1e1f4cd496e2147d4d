      "message": "It seems like this would be one frame behind. (This value applies to the next frame rather than the current frame.)\n\nWhen GbmSurfaceless::SwapBuffersAsync() is called, the frame that needs to be queried is in |unsubmitted_frames_.back()|. The SubmitFrame() call on line 125 will trigger the call to GbmSurfaceless::QueueOverlayPlane() via the call in line 215, which happens after |is_on_external_drm_device_| is checked.\n\nThough this will really only affect the first few frames in the worst case. And exposing RequiresGlFinish() via the GlSurfaceOverlay is a non-trivial amount of work. Perhaps this is good enough as a short term fix until we can pipe the fence FD?\n\nThough, this should be documented so we can keep track of the hack.",

      "message": "You\u0027re correct, we\u0027d be relying on implicit sync on external devices, where the workaround is enabled, for the first swapbuffers.\n\nIn practice we didn\u0027t notice any artifacts after we plug in a mimo, conversely before this patch the fb would be significant corrupted.\nI suspect chrome ends up always calling swapbuffers more than once when we plug in a new device, mitigating this issue.\n\nI considered exposing RequiresGlFinish and, as you said, it\u0027d be a much bigger change. Considering this is just a specific hack for a specific workaround, before we pipe in fence FDs, I think it\u0027s a reasonable fix for the time being.\n\nAdded a note just before testing |is_on_external_drm_device_|.",
