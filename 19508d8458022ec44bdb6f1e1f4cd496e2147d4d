      "message": "It seems like this would be one frame behind. (This value applies to the next frame rather than the current frame.)\n\nWhen GbmSurfaceless::SwapBuffersAsync() is called, the frame that needs to be queried is in |unsubmitted_frames_.back()|. The SubmitFrame() call on line 125 will trigger the call to GbmSurfaceless::QueueOverlayPlane() via the call in line 215, which happens after |is_on_external_drm_device_| is checked.\n\nThough this will really only affect the first few frames in the worst case. And exposing RequiresGlFinish() via the GlSurfaceOverlay is a non-trivial amount of work. Perhaps this is good enough as a short term fix until we can pipe the fence FD?\n\nThough, this should be documented so we can keep track of the hack.",
