      "message": "This is a good thing to test. I didn\u0027t do this in the Address version of this CL. Mea culpa! I relied on the default being tested by the other pre-existing tests... but what you\u0027ve done here is better.\n\nThat said, instead of asserting, I would suggesting creating a ScopedFeatlureList here to explicitly disable the feature in this scope.\n\nYou can separately add a one liner test to assert that it\u0027s disabled by default.",
