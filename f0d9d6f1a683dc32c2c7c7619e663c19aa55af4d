      "message": "OK; the only thing I don\u0027t like is that it makes the mojo definition different from the C++ definition.  Even if the port is never passed via mojo, I think ideally these would stay consistent (mojo is just a mechanism to pass the data from process to process).\n\nI didn\u0027t see any typemap already defined for net::IPEndpoint in net/interfaces.  However a port could be added to CastMediaSink.\n\nWhat do you think?  Derek, any thoughts?",
