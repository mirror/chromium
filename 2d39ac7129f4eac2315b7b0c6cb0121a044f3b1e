That isn\u0027t the case here. \n\nOoops, thank you.\n\n\u003e That said, can you supply an empty callback here? By that I mean CookieManager::DeleteCookiesCallback() (I no doubt have the exact name wrong here, the mojom bindings generate a \u0027using\u0027 for the callback type, use it).?\n\n*chuckle*  We appear to have consistently different aesthetics around which features to take advantage of and which to leave alone.  I had thought about doing that, and had decided that there was a good enough argument against treating null callbacks as \"Don\u0027t do anything\" (as opposed to \"Uninitialized; DCHECK() so the author realizes they aren\u0027t doing anything\") that I would avoid it in this case.  But the care factor is low--done.",
