      "message": "This has been discussed before, but there are enough subtle differences to make code sharing difficult.\n\nFor example, display item list applies border radius clip using clip region, not a pair of isolating/blending layers, thus inter-operates with blend mode easily. The composited counterpart needs to swap blending operation carefully to make it right.\n\nFor another example, non-AA rect clips can be applied as property state in composited layers, but the display item list counterpart needs to manage proper nesting of begin/end clip items.",
