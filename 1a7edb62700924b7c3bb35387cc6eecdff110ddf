      "message": "I like the simplistic approach of only checking browser windows. Checking all windows is indeed better, but I think it\u0027ll prove subtle and particularly tricky. For example, the code you have below doesn\u0027t deal with shaped windows and/or transparent windows.\n\nSo, I would be inclined to change this function to take a set of windows and then return a vector based on order (or take a vector and have it reorder in place, either one).\n\nAlso, please make this take a callback as in the mash world this will be an async operation.",
