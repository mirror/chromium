      "message": "Varun: This is the only change that could affect SB2.Delay.\nI believe it is a bug without this line, consider the following sequence on Android:\n1) A SB check is started in parallel with starting request;\n2) A redirect happens, we defer the request, and also enter the DEFERRED_UNCHECKED_REDIRECT state. At this point, we set defer_start_time_ to, let\u0027s say, T1.\n3) When the SB check for (1) is done, we report SB2.Delay (Now_1 - T1).\n4) We get into this method ResumeRequest() to start a new SB check for the redirect. The original code doesn\u0027t update defer_start_time_ here.\n5) When the SB check for (4) is done, we report another SB2.Delay (Now_2 - T1). Because part of that duration has been reported in (3), I think it is incorrect. We never \"accumulate\" delay like this in all other cases for SB2.Delay.\n\nWDYT? Thanks!",
