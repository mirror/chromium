      "message": "I think the changes here makes sense.\n\nIf keeping the existing code and only changing the generateOffer(), that basically means only one peerconnection creates an offer and set it as both local and remote description which is not how the peerconnection is used in the real world. Also, when setting the remote description, the signalling state would be incorrect. It\u0027s also more clear to use two peerconnections here. \n\nDoes it make sense to you? Sorry that I didn\u0027t bring this up when we talked in person.",

      "message": "generateOffer() does not decide what you do with the offer, so if you want to use two PCs you can do that.\n\nBut I agree not relying on a helper function here is more clear. generateOffer() does very little an does not provide much value.\n\nIn fact on second thought I think the helper function is bad and shouldn\u0027t be used: it obscures what\u0027s going on in the test and it asserts things about the SDP that is unrelated to what this test is testing, so if the test would fail assertions in the helper function it would fail the entire test which could be misleading. Different behaviors should be tested separately to give helpful test results, and here we do not care about e.g. number of m-lines that the offer contains, we care about offer/SLD/SRD succeeding, not the SDP details.\n\nKeep this as-is.",
