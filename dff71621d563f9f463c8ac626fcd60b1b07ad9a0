      "message": "Ah ha, but that is the problem! In ios \u003c11, |viewWillTransitionToSize| was getting called on first load every time. So we did in fact rely on that call to size the widget properly (it seems like |widgetActiveDisplayMode| never had a correct value in viewDidLoad). In ios11, on first load, it does not get called (I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s because the widget already has the size it last had, which is identical and therefore there\u0027s no transitioning to size of any kind). That\u0027s why the bug only applies to ios11, and why I need to place this call here.",
