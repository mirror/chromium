In particular, compared to your link, I find this line easy to understand:\n\nif (!disabled) {\n  // do the work\n}\n\nbut there\u0027s some code below that amounts to:\n\nbool IsDisabledForProfile() {\n  if (IsAutoDisableDisabled()) {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\nThat\u0027s like a quadruple negative.\n\nSo while I would still like to see the feature param default to false, I would absolutely be happy to see IsAutoOptOutDisabled() renamed to IsAutoOptOutEnabled(), and probably IsDisabledForProfile() to IsEnabledForProfile().",
