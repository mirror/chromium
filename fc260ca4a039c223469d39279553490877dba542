      "message": "If we receive key event sequence like (press Space -\u003e press Ctrl -\u003e release Space -\u003e release Ctrl), press Space event is sent to the client, but release Space event will not be sent to the client because it\u0027s a reserved shortcut.\nIt\u0027s not desired behavior, so I added this check as same as in L72.",

      "message": "should we wait with this until we receive a key that is not a reserved accelerator?\n\ndo we need to clear pending_keys_acks_ when we do this?\n\nnormally we send the modifiers before the enter event, this doing that differently. it would be better if we could be consistent.\n\ncan we call \"SetFocus(focus_)\" to solve some of the above issues?",

Non-reserved shortcuts pressed before a reserved shortcut are still valid and should be processed if they are not consumed by the client.\n\nI moved this part to after sending the modifiers.",
