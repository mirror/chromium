      "message": "Right, that\u0027s kinda what I figured. However, I think that also means that it\u0027s a compiler bug (since there shouldn\u0027t be a way this function can actually fail to return something).\n\nDo you have to have this change to get things to compile? Is it possible that this is a known bug?",
