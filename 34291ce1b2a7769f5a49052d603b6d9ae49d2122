      "message": "\u003e This means that the first bullet point here is a behaviour change; is that intentional?\n\nYes and no.  Since the bindings are instantiated lazily, you can really have all sorts of fun with this in the current system. e.g.,\n\nchrome.runtime.sendMessage \u003d \u0027foo\u0027;\ntypeof chrome.extension.sendMessage;  // \"string\"\n\nvs\n\nchrome.extension;\nchrome.runtime.sendMessage \u003d \u0027foo\u0027;\ntypeof chrome.extension.sendMessage;  // \"function\"\n\nGiven there was no real defined behavior before, I\u0027m inclined to not overly-complicate this now, especially since all of these APIs are deprecated and undocumented.  But if you think differently, I\u0027m happy to entertain alternatives. :) (because I, too, am not a fan of this)",
