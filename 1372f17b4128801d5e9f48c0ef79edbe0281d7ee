      "message": "With SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS we could probably just get rid of this check all together. If a benchmark has SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS \u003d [expectations.ALL_ANDROID/ALL_MOBILE] then it will only ever make it this far if the phone is an android device.\n\nThat might cause problems if a benchmark that should set SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS doesn\u0027t, but if we have a mobile benchmark running on a desktop platform, maybe problems should be expected?\n\nAre there cases where a benchmark contains stories with this shared state, and other stories with another? Thats the only case I can think of that might be broken by just removing this check.",
