However, it is true that a more general statement would be more appropriate. I\u0027ve uploaded a new version with better text.\n\nI think it really helps when the instructions given in a tutorial work as-is, without hidden expectations. Maybe a better solution would be to not mention the build instructions on line 62 at all, or move them to their own section with a real example?",

      "message": "\"Adding the dependency it to the top-level was the simplest / most immediate fix.\"\nAlthough that works, it is a pattern that we shouldn\u0027t encourage, and also it makes people assume incorrectly that this target is special that it has to be deps of a top-level target.\n\n\"I think it really helps when the instructions given in a tutorial work as-is, without hidden expectations\"\nYes. Agreed that instructions should work as-is. That being said, it is not too high a bar to expect that people reading this doc has some basic knowledge of GN. A vast majority of chrome devs, if not all, should already have that knowledge.\n\n\nYour updated patch LGTM. Thanks!",
