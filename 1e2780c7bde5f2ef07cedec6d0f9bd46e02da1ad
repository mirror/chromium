      "message": "Thanks, I\u0027m trying to fix the document. Adding the dependency it to the top-level was the simplest / most immediate fix. However, it is true that a more general statement would be more appropriate. I\u0027ve uploaded a new version with better text.\n\nI think it really helps when the instructions given in a tutorial work as-is, without hidden expectations. Maybe a better solution would be to not mention the build instructions on line 62 at all, or move them to their own section with a real example?",
