      "message": "This will not work with GCC. GCC inserts suffixes, so for function \u0027foo\u0027 there may potentially be additional symbols like: foo.isra.12.constprop.34 with \u0027magic parts\u0027 of foo. I don\u0027t think we will ever switch to GCC, using it just as an illustration of how brittle it is to rely on not seeing \u0027.\u0027 in symbols.\n\nTwo options I can see:\n\n1. [less work, more slow] tweak _ExpandSection in patch_orderfile.py and produce/upload/verify two orderfiles in orderfile_generator.\n\n2. [more work? maybe later?] If we are worried about this extra unnecessary uploading (the func names are more compact than section names - because of these suffixes), then we can make the new func orderfile authoritative, and expand it in runhooks to the full orderfile, we\u0027d factor out and reuse patch_orderfile._PREFIXES presumably.\n\nI\u0027d vote for (1) in short term ..",
