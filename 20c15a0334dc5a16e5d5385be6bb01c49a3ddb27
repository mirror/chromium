I created unittests for VectorMath functions before making any modifications to the functions for the very reason that we could be sure that the behaviour does not change (and it has not changed).\n\n\u003e I checked a version from 3 months ago, and *max_p was assigned source_max, not max(*max_p, source_max).\n\nI assume you checked the full blink::VectorMath::Vmaxmgv function from 3 months ago instead of checking the second while loop within that function which is now replaced by this blink::VectorMath::SSE::Vmaxmgv.",
