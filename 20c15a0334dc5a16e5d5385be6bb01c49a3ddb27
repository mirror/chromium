We already know it\u0027s a name space.\n\nHere we know that it\u0027s a name space whose name is the value of the VECTOR_MATH_SIMD_NAMESPACE_NAME macro (SSE in the case of VectorMathSSE.cpp and AVX in the case of VectorMathAVX.cpp in I8f1b6b7bce4d4ebfc254ed7d67758a68c20ec93a). I\u0027m not sure it is obvious from macro definition (in VectorMathSSE.cpp) that the macro defines a name space name unless the macro name contains some reference to purpose.\n\n\u003e And also, see https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespace_Names\n\nAre you saying that the name space name (SSE) should be lowercased? To me it seems that blink name space names are not yet transitioned to follow Google C++ Style Guide (VectorMath is camelcased etc.).",

      "message": "\u003e Really sorry about this that I didn\u0027t see this before, but this seems different from how Vmaxmgv behaved before.\n\nNo problem, as this is in fact the same behaviour for this part of the code as before (even though it may seem different). I created unittests for VectorMath functions before making any modifications to the functions for the very reason that we could be sure that the behaviour does not change (and it has not changed).\n\n\u003e I checked a version from 3 months ago, and *max_p was assigned source_max, not max(*max_p, source_max).\n\nI assume you checked the full blink::VectorMath::Vmaxmgv function from 3 months ago instead of checking the second while loop within that function which is now replaced by this blink::VectorMath::SSE::Vmaxmgv.",
