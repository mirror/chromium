      "message": "i\u0027m okay with trying this approach out, but i\u0027m curious about whether the code would feel safer if the screen-on delay lived inside of TabletPowerButtonController instead of in PowerButtonDisplayController. to do that, i think that you could make PowerButtonDisplayController have a base::TimeTicks screen_state_last_changed_ member and accessor, and then check that from TPBC when deciding what to do. does that sound reasonable?\n\ni think that the general principle i\u0027m applying here is that i prefer to push hacks like this (i.e. we don\u0027t know how long the screen *really* takes to turn on) to an outer layer of the code instead of putting them in a more-core class like this, where they can have unintended effects on other users of the class.",
