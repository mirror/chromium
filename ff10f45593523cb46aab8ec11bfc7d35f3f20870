      "message": "Passing around/switching on CSSPropertyID is something that Ribbon is working towards removing. this property specific logic should live inside the API files. Utils files should not reference CSSPropetyID, so this method should be refactored to remove the need for that before implementing these APIs. E.g. I removed the usage of this method in longhand parsing using callbacks in https://codereview.chromium.org/2849363002. For the shorthand parsing, this might be a case for calling ParseSingleValue of longhands directly. You might need to get property descriptors for longhand here. Will require some thought.",

I\u0027m leaning towards changing it to enum as passing a literal here makes it clear that there *is* no legacy parsing in this case, although that means that the local_context would need to store an enum instead of a bool.
