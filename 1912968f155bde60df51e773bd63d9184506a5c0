      "message": "This patch aligns JDA with the behavior of VDA and VEA. I am ok with this approach, but for the sake of consistency we should also do that for the VDA and VDE unittests (and possibly others?).\n\nAlso tracking precisely when video/jpeg decode/encode acceleration is available might prove tricky at the build files level. i.e. do we need a flag for each of video decode, video encode, and jpeg decode acceleration, or do they always come as a single group?",
