      "message": "This file is autogenerated; see the comment at the top of the file. You\u0027ll need to add this test to src/content/test/gpu/generate_buildbot_json.py . For now, use the predicate FYI_ONLY, use \u0027win\u0027 in the tester_configs field, and use the \"disabled_tester_configs\" to turn the test off on every bot except \"Win10 Release (NVIDIA)\".\n\nI\u0027m sorry but we can\u0027t put this on the commit queue yet as we don\u0027t have enough capacity on the Windows 10 GPU bots to even run this on the optional GPU tryservers. We will try to work with the infra team over the next few weeks to upgrade the bulk of the fleet from Windows 7 to Windows 10, at which point you can put this on the optional tryservers.",
