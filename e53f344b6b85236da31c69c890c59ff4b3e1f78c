      "message": "I think the CL description just needs more verbosity.  Here\u0027s what\u0027s going on, as far as I can see:\n\nElideUrl calls FormatUrl with kFormatUrlOmitDefaults, which includes stripping http unconditionally (https  is preserved).  Then, if the elision code can\u0027t fit things, it may later strip off the scheme (including https in this case, or http if it were to have been left on originally).\n\nHence, this CL is just making sure that https is not stripped if there\u0027s enough space for the entire original URL.",
