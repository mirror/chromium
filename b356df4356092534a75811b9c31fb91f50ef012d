Isn\u0027t TaskTrait\u0027s |shutdown_behavior_| field going to default to CONTINUE_ON_SHUTDOWN (the first enum value), even if shutdown_behavior_set_explicitly_ is still false? Can you maybe update the code to make it easier to find where the default gets set? Because I tried before posting my last comment, and apparently failed.\n\nI\u0027m also surprised to hear that the default is SKIP_ON_SHUTDOWN. Why don\u0027t we default to the lighter weight CONTINUE_ON_SHUTDOWN if the caller hasn\u0027t specified / doesn\u0027t care? Why waste resources/block shutdown?",
