      "message": "Instead of rewriting Control as Meta (which seems a bit... deceptive and a source of confusion/bugs), can you just make sure this is always Meta on Mac to begin with?\n\nIt looks like there are no callers to this function that actually supply a modifier, other than the test. Is that right? If so, is there a future use of modifiers? Then you could just put the #if defined(OS_MACOSX) into the test and pass ControlKey or MetaKey as appropriate.",
