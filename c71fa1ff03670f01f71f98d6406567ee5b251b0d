      "message": "High level comment: I\u0027m concerned that this creates two different classes of UDPSockets that behave differently when they are used in the udp_socket.mojom interface, and that that will be confusing to users of that interface (i.e. to have two different types of objects where the type different isn\u0027t represented by actual different Mojo types).  At a minimum if there are two different behaviors I\u0027d like to have the two different behaviors spelled out in udp_socket.mojom, and I may push for either two actually different types, or to get rid of the different behaviors, once I understand better what the different behaviors are.  \n\nI.e. this comment is indicating a concern but isn\u0027t intended to have actionable feedback--that gets delayed until after I understand the differences in behavior :-}.",
