      "message": "\u003e is this intentionally \"_tests\" rather than \"_unittests\"?\n\nMostly. Crashpad’s tests follow Google’s guidelines, which names the test executable xyz_test if it tests xyz. (engdoc/eng/doc/devguide/coding/testing/unit-test-howto.md) That’s why we have crashpad_util_test, crashpad_snapshot_test, etc. The _unittests suffix has been deprecated at Google for a very long time.\n\nI was thinking less about that when I wrote this and more just pluralizing when combining crashpad_util_test and crashpad_snapshot_test into crashpad_tests.\n\nGoogle style would be singular crashpad_test, but I guess Chrome never adopted that.\n\nI can change it to whatever you think is best. _unittests is prevalent in Chrome, but I see examples of both _tests (gl_tests, ipc_tests) and _test (cronet_test, trace_test) too.",
