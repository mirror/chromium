      "message": "not sure that MVD should be doing this, especially given all the logic in ROI.  i know that GVD does, but i\u0027ve never liked that either :)\n\nwhat if RequestOverlayInfo(bool requires_restart) was exposed on the mojo video decoder client, and MCVD could call it during initialization if it\u0027s interested in overlay info?\n\nthen, ROI would just be a pass-through.  MCVD also doesn\u0027t have to assume anything about when MVD will request overlay info.\n\ni think that it still has all the benefits that you outline.",
