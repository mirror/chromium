They don\u0027t refer to the same thing, although AudioParameters are used as part of the input for computing AudioProcessingProperties.\n\nI plan to use AudioParameters  to validate that the hardware parameters used to generate the stream coincide with the hardware parameters used to select the device. If there is a discrepancy (which could happen in the unlikely case of the user reconfiguring devices after the algorithm runs but before the streams are generated), the best course of action would be to make getUserMedia fail.\n\nAlso, the AudioParameters might be useful to implement MediaStreamTrack.getSettings(). My understanding is that there is currently a bug by which getSettings may return invalid values until after some time after getUserMedia returns because it needs to wait for hardware parameters after the stream is generated. I still have to confirm this, but https://codereview.chromium.org/2777583002/ was a failed attempt to delay getUserMedia\u0027s return until after settings coming from AudioParameters were known.",
