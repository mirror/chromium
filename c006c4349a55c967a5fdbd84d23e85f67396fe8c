      "message": "Bah, turns out Instant Apps also use this method to determine if we should show an instant apps launch promo (using a different package_name_or_start_url).\n\nThe fix should just involve changing the ShouldShowBanner() call in chrome/browser/android/instantapps/instant_apps_settings.cc to call !HasBeenInstalled() \u0026\u0026 !RecentlyBlocked() \u0026\u0026 !RecentlyIgnored(). That has the added advantage of making sure the instant apps promo isn\u0027t affect by the experimental feature.",

      "message": "I\u0027m curious about the !HasBeenInstalled() part: I don\u0027t really know much about the instant apps installation model, but I thought they were ephemeral and had presumed that an instant app would either be \"installed\" once per use (in which case, we don\u0027t want to check whether it was previously installed, because that would result in each app only being able to be used once), or not installed at all (in which case, there\u0027s no point in checking whether it was previously installed).  Can you clarify?",
