// Spinlock is a simple spinlock class based on the standard CPU primitive of
// atomic increment and decrement of an int at a given memory address. These are
// intended only for very short duration locks and assume a system with multiple
// cores. For any potentially longer wait you should use a real lock, such as
// |base::Lock|.
//
// |SpinLock|s MUST be globals. Using them as (e.g.) struct/class members will
// result in an uninitialized lock, which is dangerously incorrect.
