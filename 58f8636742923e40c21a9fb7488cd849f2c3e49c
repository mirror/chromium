      "message": "It seems misleading to have this public constexpr when subclasses could override the border radius to be different.  We could avoid this by making GetBorderRadiusInternal() instead be a public method (GetBorderRadiusPx()) and calling that.\n\nYou tried to tackle that with OmniboxBackgroundBorder::GetBorderRadius(), but a static method isn\u0027t necessary; the location bar can access its background() (and cast) to get an instance of this object to call the method on.\n\nHowever, this last sentence suggests (I think) a better solution.  Make OmniboxBackgroundBorder::PaintFocusBorder() non-static, which allows it to get the inner border radius internally.  Then the only places that need the border radius are inside the class itself.  That should allow reorganizing the methods here to be maximally simple.",
