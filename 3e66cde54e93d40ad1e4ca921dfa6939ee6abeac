Let me know if the updated comment makes sense.\n\n(I also added a few tests to try to validate this, but I\u0027m not sure about a good way to validate the deserialization. StructTraits DCHECKs on bad input, so I guess I\u0027d have to manually serialize a bad mojo struct? But it\u0027s typemapped, which makes that somewhat harder... is there a way to still use the raw mojo structs if something is typemapped?)",
