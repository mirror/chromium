      "message": "Sanity check: if the navigation fails for whatever reason, the tab will no longer be marked as having been discarded. When a second navigation comes in and succeeds (making it the first successful navigation in the tab), it will not be marked as having taken place in a discarded tab. Is that WAI?\n\nAlso I\u0027m concerned that we migh not be marking the tab as no longer discarded correctly if we do two navigation in a row. E.g. we restore a page, and before the restore is done, we start a new navigation. We will not get a DidStopLoading in that case until the second navigation is finished, so the second navigation will likely commit with was_discarded set to true.",
