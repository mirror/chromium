      "message": "It\u0027s difficult to speculate as to how the Gecko results would look if they had \u0027width\u0027 and \u0027height\u0027 as presentation attributes in these cases, but with this patch we should at least align with WebKit. The question mark is the TODO I added in the code - which is also the reason I raised the GH issue. I guess we can call that reasonably concluded on the \"computed\" vs \"used\" value front, so with that fixed I can adjust the test to reflect that, as well as move it to WPT. (Also, FWIW, Edge appears to be using a form of used value already, since they seem to return \"0px\" for \u0027width\u0027 and \u0027height\u0027 when the initial value ought to be \"auto\" - so they obviously resolved \"auto\" to \"0px\".)",
