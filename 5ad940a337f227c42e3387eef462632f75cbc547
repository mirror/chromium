Moreover, in the comment thread on this change, you wrote\n\u003e The counterpart in V8: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/595588\nand that change only deletes the three histograms below, not this one.\n\nI\u0027m going to approve this, but please double-check whether you actually be marking this histogram as obsolete or whether this was a mistake.\n\nIn either case, please update the changelist description to point to the relevant v8 changelist(s) that deleted the histograms.",
