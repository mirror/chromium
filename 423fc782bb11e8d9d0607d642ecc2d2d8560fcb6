I am not sure if that\u0027s possible but may be worth considering, especially in Clank because there\u0027s a JNI hop involved.",

      "message": "So, it is nuanced. If an interstitial is shown, |mActivityTestRule.loadUrl(url)| will fail to stop blocking, since the URL will never reach the load event.\n\nHowever, you\u0027re right, if we replaced the loadUrl with a loadUrlNonBlocking, I\u0027m not sure of a way to wait until an interstitial is confidently never going to show.
