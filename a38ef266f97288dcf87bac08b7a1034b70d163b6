      "message": "Any call to the client_ should have this, as you did here I think. The client can call back to anything that would ProcessScheduledActions. Should we DCHECK that inside_scheduled_action_ is false when we do this? It might be easy to end up resetting it to false early if we go through 2 autoresets in the same call stack.\n\nIf you feel adventurous we could make an RAII object that gives access to the client and does these things.\n\nClientAccessor access(client_holder_);\naccess-\u003eclient()-\u003eSchedu...();\n\nOr something? If we hid client_ then it becomes hard/impossible to do this wrong.",

We could DCHECK inside_processed_scheduled_actions_ instead to show that the client_ call won\u0027t run the scheduler re-entrantly. I guess it\u0027s just the things that are post-tasked/given as callbacks that need to set this inside_scheduler bool of some sort.",
