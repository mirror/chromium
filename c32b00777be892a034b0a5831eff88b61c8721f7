Rather than a bunch of #ifdef / #else for the different code paths, you can simply include 2 different files depending on the architecture. One of the files uses the new way, the other uses the old way. Both files provide the inlined function with the same name.\n\nSo only one of the files gets included / inlined -- the ideal one for that architecture. It is like a C version of policies. :)",
