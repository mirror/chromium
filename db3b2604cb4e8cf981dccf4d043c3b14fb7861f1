      "message": "I\u0027m assuming that this \"empty GURL\" part is for CountStreamsForSession()? \nCountStreamsForSession() is only used in testing and logging. I think we should try not to build in test-only logic in this comparator.\n\nFor NetLog, this is called to construct the SpdySession tab. We can change that so SpdySessionPool gets push stream info from Http2PushPromiseIndex directly instead of going to SpdySession to get it.",
