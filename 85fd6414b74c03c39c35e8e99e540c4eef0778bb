I would agree that it doesn\u0027t exactly preserve what the author intended, but since any decimal value will be interpreted as the closest integer, it would be the same as specifying #020202.",

      "message": "That\u0027s true, I hadn\u0027t considered that. The potential for damage should be less since the original value would still be shown in either the \"original\" or \"RGB\" modes, and only the other modes would show the rounded value. However, I\u0027m not sure if this is enough.\n\nWould you recommend just making it so that an RGB value that contains a decimal cannot be changed into other forms?",

      "message": "After working on a first implementation of this suggestion, I\u0027m not entirely sure that this makes sense. When we calculate for instance HSL values, we still convert those into HEX and RGB, even if those conversions aren\u0027t necessarily preserving the accuracy of the value as intended. However, they do preserve the accuracy in their original form (which is still accessible), and authors can see what the most similar value in other formats would be.\n\nIn order to implement this, we would probably need to indicate if a) the format was originally from RGB, and b) if the format originally had a decimal. I\u0027m not sure if this requires the additional complexity. I can implement it this way if it is thought to be best, but it would seem to add additional complexity and confusion for developers. Given that format changing is already not completely accurate, it would seem okay to allow conversions such as this. Increasing the conversion accuracy for e.g. RGB -\u003e HSL might alleviate some of these concerns.",
