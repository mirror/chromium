      "message": "I think the problem could be caused by this line. In the case that Mouse is released before the mouse dragging fires, SetMouseDragging is not called with true, but drag_view_ is initiated in OnMousePressed, then EndDrag will not be called in this scenario, which result in DCHECK(!drag_view_) burst in AppsGridView destructor. Removing this line should help.",
