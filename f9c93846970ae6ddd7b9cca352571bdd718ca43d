      "message": "Are you sure we want to include \"delayed\" tasks here? It means that the result of IsIdleForTesting() is timing-dependent, e.g. if I post a 30ms delayed task and the system is busy by the time I call IsIdleForTesting() the answer may be |false|, rather than |true|.  \n\nWhere tests rely on IsIdleForTesting(), they really need to either (a) not post any delayed tasks or (b) post them only to MessageLoops with mocked time, for it to be deterministic(*).\n\nWDYT?\n\n(*) Assuming that the test must otherwise be arranging for inter-thread task posting to be synchronized in some way, otherwise it would already be racey :)",

      "message": "Agreed that these conditions make a test racy. I\u0027m already not a fan of this check though and think tests using it have better alternative, especially if they\u0027re playing with delayed tasks.\n\nThis test has been wrong for years IMO so this change merely highlights poorly written tests that were testing this when not necessary/inappropriate.\n\nAs I mentioned @ https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/853143, we do want to include delayed tasks so that this maps to \"RunUntilIdle() will not do work\".",
