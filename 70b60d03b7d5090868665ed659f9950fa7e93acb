      "message": "I think you could pass the handle to the reader (instead of the buffer), using an Initialize() methods which would return a bool (to check success), that way you could eliminate the shared_buffer_ member variable completely in this class. The validity check can be performed inside the reader. Basically similar to the what shared_memory_seqlock_reader does. I think it would be fine to do in a follow-up patch, if this one is blocking progress (in which case file a bug and add TODO)..\n\nWe also need to make sure reillyg@ is sufficiently happy with this approach. :)",
