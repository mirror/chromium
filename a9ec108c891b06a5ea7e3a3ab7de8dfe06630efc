      "message": "Unix style is options come first.  Maybe also write\n\n\"[-[viR]]\" instead of \"[options]\", which the typical Unix man-page style for a quick summary of options.\n\n(Because our list of options is short.)\n\nAlso, I think typical unix style is that as you go through all the command line args, once a non-option value is found, anything after that is treated as a file, not an option.  So\n\nlayout-test-tidy -vi path1 path2 -R path3 path4\n\nignores the -R option.  Are you allowing this?  Does this mean -R will only apply to path3 and path4?  That seems nice, actually.\n\nShould also note that only html and js files are processed; any other extension is ignored. (Maybe not right here, but somewhere.)",
