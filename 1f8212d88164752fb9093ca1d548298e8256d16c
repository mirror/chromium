      "message": "New uses of the chrome:: namespace are banned (we\u0027re trying to kill that namespace); try to find a different way to do this than a global function.  For example, hoist SimpleMessageBoxViews\u0027 declaration to this file and have a public static Show() method; find an existing more narrow namespace to put this under; change the namespace for the stuff in simple_message_box.h to something more specific and add this to that; or move this declaration to that file under some kind of #if TOOLKIT_VIEWS.\n\nNone of these are perfect; I\u0027d probably do the first.",
