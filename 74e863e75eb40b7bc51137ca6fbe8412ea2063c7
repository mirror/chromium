      "message": "naming nit: It\u0027s a bit confusing to have both WatchTimeRecorder and WatchTimeReporter. \n\nHow about media::WatchTimeRecorder -\u003e media::mojom::WatchTimeRecorder -\u003e content::WatchTimeRecorderImpl or content::WatchTimeRecorderService? Though recently we try to stay away from \"Service\" since \"mojo Service\" has a totally different meaning now (as in \"ServiceManager\").",

      "message": "Yes, I feel they are quite similar, but don\u0027t have a great suggestion.\n\nI choose the Recorder suffix since that\u0027s what\u0027s used by UMA reporting; e.g. StatisticsRecorder. I also did not use Service for the reason you mention. I also don\u0027t like Impl for classes that only have a single implementation.",
