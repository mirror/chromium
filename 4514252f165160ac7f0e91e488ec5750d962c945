      "message": "Android has two native VPN types: L2TP/IPsec and PPTP.  Chrome OS has native support for L2TP/IPsec and OpenVPN, but not PPTP.  So the newly-landed ARC VPN code can be leveraged to enable PPTP VPNs through Android (crbug.com/207904).\n\nPPTP is an older protocol that is common in the Microsoft world.  It has a lot of security issues, but it is still popular because the client is built into Windows, and easy to use.",
