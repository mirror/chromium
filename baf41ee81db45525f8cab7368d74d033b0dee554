      "message": "Actually, I was curious why this (anchor) used a different origin than |point| - reading the spec some more it seems this expression may have been correct (both relative to the same origin, so the additional offset cancels out.) In what coordinate space the |point| (offset-path) was defined wasn\u0027t entirely obvious though. (With the old formulation there\u0027s a lingering bounding_box.X()/Y() in there, suggesting |point| would be relative to a different origin.)",
