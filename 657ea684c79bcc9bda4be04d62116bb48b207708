      "message": "Justin is right. This extension becomes part of WebGL2 core and is no longer available. So in WebGL2 this will return false, but actually the support is there.\n\nI also have a question(concern?). This and the color buffer extension are user visible extensions. If you enable them implicitly internally, won\u0027t that mess up WebGL states? I am not against doing this, but I think this behavior needs to be well documented in some spec that\u0027s visible to developers.",
