      "message": "A few notes about this function:\n - It\u0027s probably a good idea to add a unit test.\n - The piece of the function that extracts the commit position from the body could be extracted to a little helper function.\n - If you add an explicit \"return None\" at the end, that will make it more explicit what will happen if no PRs match.\n - Probably unimportant, but it\u0027s worth noting that this is quite strict about the format (if there\u0027s not exactly one space after the colon, it won\u0027t match). If you wanted to make it less strict, you could also use regex.",
