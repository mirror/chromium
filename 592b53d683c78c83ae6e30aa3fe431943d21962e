      "message": "Yeah, I found this plumbing kinda awkward too. We used to create skia objects lazily but had to switch to creating at paint object construction time to avoid weird race conditions (crbug.com/771156).",

      "message": "I thought through that too, but these are all on temporary flags that don\u0027t stick around.  I don\u0027t think the bool vs lazy intialization of shaders on these temporary flags makes a difference wrt race conditions.  Am I missing something?",

Eventually it ends up getting accessed here in SkPaint conversion during raster (https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/paint/paint_flags.cc?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d118) which has no image provider. . .",
