A fast-forward? Why can\u0027t I find it?\nJust want to make sure I don\u0027t sign off on the wrong version or switching to a different branch accidentally.\n\nThe updating of version number doesn\u0027t seem to be very frequent though, v.1.6.0 was a year and a half ago and I don\u0027t see any tags between 1.6 and 1.7.\nIs there anything you could write here to indicate that it is a more recent version than v.1.7.0?",
