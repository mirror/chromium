      "message": "Good catch -- by checking against the automation scripts in wpt_automation, I found that two more tests are supposed to be automated:\n\n  external/wpt/pointerevents/pointerevent_disabled_form_control-manual.html\n  external/wpt/pointerevents/extension/pointerevent_coalesced_events_attributes-manual.html\n\nNow, since all fullscreen tests use the same automation script, I guess that means external/wpt/fullscreen/api/element-request-fullscreen-two-iframes-manual.html is also supposed to be automated, but times out currently, right?",
