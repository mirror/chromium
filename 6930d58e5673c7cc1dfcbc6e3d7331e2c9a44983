      "message": "This causes a |previews_state_| of PREVIEWS_NO_TRANSFORM to be returned as kPreviewsOff. Could you instead change this to return (previews_state_ \u0026 disabled_bits)? Just in case Blink wants to have different behavior for kPreviewsNoTransform vs. kPreviewsOff.\n\nEither that or just return |previews_state_|, since the above DCHECK *should* enforce that it doesn\u0027t have any other bits set. Normally, I\u0027d recommend relying on the DCHECK and just returning |previews_state_|, but since this code is kinda related to communication between the renderer and browser processes, there\u0027s an argument to be made for making this code more robust.",

      "message": "Now that the LocalFrame is doing less trivial work here, could you perhaps add a test for it somehow? I know it\u0027s a pain to create new tests for these files, especially since a LocalFrameTest.cpp doesn\u0027t already exist, but it\u0027ll definitely help make this code more robust.\n\nYou could probably create a subclass of blink::RenderingTest (kinda like how LocalFrameViewTest.cpp does), and pass in your own mocked version of LocalFrameClient in it\u0027s constructor. You could adapt a lot of the old test cases from render_frame_impl_browsertests.cc for ShouldUseClientLoFiForRequest, and just check FetchParameters::GetPlaceholderImageRequestType() to see if a placeholder is being used or not.",
