      "message": "In general we\u0027re moving away from layout tests (when not web platform tests that are shareable with other browsers) and towards unit tests. It makes sense to have some integration tests in the form of layout tests but I think it would be best to have the majority of tests be unit tests. If the tests were written as unittests instead of layouttests, would the new internals methods be needed?",

      "message": "Most of the rootScroller tests are unit tests. However, for the background patch, I really do want to ensure that the pixel result is accurate so I think an integration test in this case is appropriate. These would eventually be upstreamed to WPT.\n\nThe lack of browser controls manipulation in layout tests has actually long been a thorn since Browser Control behavior is speared between Blink and CC so unit testing many bugs/scenarios is difficult from just one side of the divide.",
