      "message": "I\u0027m introducing |expected_header_index| instead of relying on |iter| because (1) |iter| is incremented by EnumerateHeaderLines(), so I would need to write |iter-1| everywhere, which is cumbersome, (2) |iter| is incremented by two for the test case where the value has two entries separated by a comma, so one pair of elements in |expected_headers| would be skipped.  These would need a lot of explanation in comments, it seems easier to use a separate variable.",
