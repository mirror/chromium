      "message": "I\u0027m introducing |expected_header_index| instead of relying on |iter| because (1) |iter| is incremented by EnumerateHeaderLines(), so I would need to write |iter-1| everywhere, which is cumbersome, (2) |iter| is incremented by two for the test case where the value has two entries separated by a comma, so one pair of elements in |expected_headers| would be skipped.  These would need a lot of explanation in comments, it seems easier to use a separate variable.",

      "message": "I think I\u0027m having a bad brain day, but I don\u0027t understand if the test expectations are changing in this test. In particular, you\u0027re changing a test-only .cc file so that shouldn\u0027t change chrome behavior, obviously. But you\u0027re also changing a test and this one is a bit opaque so I can\u0027t quite figure out what\u0027s effectively changing in this test. Can you walk me through it?",
