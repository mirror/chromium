      "message": "ngl it\u0027s really hard to keep all the redirection and clients and delegates in my head and I don\u0027t know that I could explain to someone how to use this correctly on the first try.\n\nNot that I see anything incorrect here just.. yeah.\n\nTrying to think of other options but not doing very well.\n\nMaybe if OverridenDelegateControllerForTesting was \"OriginalDelegate\"? OriginalDelegateProxy? idk.. the name as it is left me in a state of awe for a while.\n\nAnd it feels like maybe we want to override the client, but are settling for putting a bool in the prod client? Like this is returning a different Client* that will function correctly, while the original one becomes broken but it takes quite some thinking to see that and how to use it for tests (it lets u call Run on the original delete and always return and then call your own Client in a loop right?)\n\nI guess one core premise here is that this override will be called *after* setting up the original delegate. Is that required? Would this get less complicated if the override was set up before?",
