GlobalReplace also takes a lot of time (see https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/attachmentText?aid\u003d309244#1234). FYI, we also use lazy matchers (https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/autofill/content/renderer/page_passwords_analyser.cc?rcl\u003d5d6f8bb299ca72222f1db245aa6e1806eaae62c1\u0026l\u003d90). But my understanding is that matching is too slow. It is why I decided to exclude RE entirely.",
