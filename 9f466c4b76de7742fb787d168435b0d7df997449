      "message": "I have a broader design question around the messages.  Any reason we need the openTabInBackground call in this class at all?\n\nI\u0027m wondering if we should just send ACTION_TAB_CREATION and have the service do all the heavy lifting.  That would allow the service to load the native library if needed to prevent blocking the dialog with the progress bar.  (Also, I don\u0027t think the service should necessarily have the code for tab creation -- that should be in a separate helper, but triggered by the service).\n\nWhen we want to start saving tab state to disk, do we want to do that in the service or are we going to do it in this class?  I could imagine we might need to do a fair amount of I/O, so I don\u0027t know if the progress dialog vs the service is best.\n\nBut yeah, I\u0027m still thinking that sending a single message should be cleaner here.",

We should try to keep this selector as unaware of browser actions as possible.\n\nIs this creation finished event needed to ensure the tab state has been saved to disk?  The above call adds it to the save queue, but I don\u0027t think it actually guarantees it is persisted.  We actually probably want a callback that the tab state has been written to disk (might need to add an observer to the persistent store for that though), which could be a TODO for this.",
