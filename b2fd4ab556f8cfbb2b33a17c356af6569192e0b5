      "message": "This DHCECK verifies that correct observed value is being passed to WaitEnd() below, so to me this seems like a reasonable place for it (perhaps it would be better if there was no empty line between the DCHECK and WaitEnd()). Anyway, given that I already landed this CL I think we can keep it as is and fix it when this code needs to be changed again.",
