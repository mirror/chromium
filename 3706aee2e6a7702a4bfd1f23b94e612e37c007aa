      "message": "Would it be reasonable to do something like:\n- set/unset a class (name \u0027dark\u0027 for example) if needed, based on the current `video_element` status;\n- add to modernMediaControls_loading.css something like `#spinner.dark { background-color: black; }`.\n\nI think it has the benefit of only updating the class when needed (we could probably read the property but it may have a cost) and separates the logic (in C++) from the design (in CSS). WDYT?",
