      "message": "Just a thought:  These static global switches can get a bit ugly.  Another approach is to make a small subclass in test code that exposes public SetDirtyForTesting(), which in turn just calls the protected set_dirty().  Then the production code isn\u0027t polluted with \"for test\" code.  See TextUrlBarTexture ::url_text() and friends as an example.  In this CL, there\u0027s already a global, so it\u0027s probably okay to have another.\n\nThis is a bit different than the previous \"testable constructor\" topic, where we were saying it\u0027s okay to have more flexible constructors (possibly used for testing).",
