      "message": "It seems sort of sad that the reason AddComboboxRow() can\u0027t return a Combobox object (in parallel with AddTextfieldRow()) is that we need to use this class; and the reason we need to use this class is to prevent wide bookmark bubbles; and the alternate solution for that would be to simply make the GridLayout column for the second thing in the stack FIXED instead of USE_PREF.\n\nCan we do something like that instead?  It seems like every time we create a textfield stack, we want column 1 to be \"max of the preferred widths\", 2 to be \"fixed padding\", and 3 to be \"all remaining available width\".  I\u0027d think that column 3 definition could be achieved using fixed-but-stretchy width.",

But it surprised me. Combobox also uses CalculatePreferredSize() for its *minimum* size, so using FIXED-but-stretchy seems to exploit the fact that GridLayout can ignore a View\u0027s specified minimum size when using FIXED. Are we OK with that?\n\nOtherwise, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a way to do this without modifying logic in views::Combobox.",

If we want to plumb the minimum/preferred sizes to make them available to people using textfield stacks, I suppose we could build a few helpers that could query the underlying views inside the stacks and supply this to callers, so they could manually size dialogs as needed.",
