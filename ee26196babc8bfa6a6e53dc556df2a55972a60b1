      "message": "It seems sort of sad that the reason AddComboboxRow() can\u0027t return a Combobox object (in parallel with AddTextfieldRow()) is that we need to use this class; and the reason we need to use this class is to prevent wide bookmark bubbles; and the alternate solution for that would be to simply make the GridLayout column for the second thing in the stack FIXED instead of USE_PREF.\n\nCan we do something like that instead?  It seems like every time we create a textfield stack, we want column 1 to be \"max of the preferred widths\", 2 to be \"fixed padding\", and 3 to be \"all remaining available width\".  I\u0027d think that column 3 definition could be achieved using fixed-but-stretchy width.",
