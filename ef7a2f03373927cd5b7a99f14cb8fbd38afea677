      "message": "this isn\u0027t quite accurate. The fact that |bytes| has |embedded_data| has no influence on wether |data| needs to be a valid BytesProvider or not (even if the renderer might have included embedded_data it might still be the case that the browser process doesn\u0027t use embedded_data). Maybe a better comment would explain that rather than getting the bytes provider from the DataElementBytes, this possibly uses |data| to acquire the byte data asynchronously.",
