      "message": "Help me understand this patch.\nI believe all calls to inflate_fast() are now calling the original, non-NEON-optimized version of the function. To facilitate this, the optimized version is now named inflate_fast_chunky().\n\nSo we only call inflate_fast_chunky() here, which won\u0027t be reached by inflateBack().\n\nThe net result of all this is inflateBack() no longer calls the new code.\n\nIs my understanding correct?",
