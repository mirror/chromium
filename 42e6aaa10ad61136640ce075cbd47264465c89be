      "message": "Correct. The \"Not AuthRoot, but built-in\" also covers roots (particularly gov roots) that were removed by Microsoft - but which we include in our built-in list because we consider a cross-section against time - and were added back by users/enterprises. Think of things like the \"SHA-1 legacy CAs\" that made an exodus prior to the SHA-2 transition as examples of that.",
