      "message": "Here\u0027s an example of what scares me.. This suggests Apple switched from NSGrayFrame to NSThemeFrame in 10.8. Seems they could easily switch to a different name in a future release. But I guess _not_ relying on NSThemeFrame to exist didn\u0027t give us any advantage going in to 10.13",
