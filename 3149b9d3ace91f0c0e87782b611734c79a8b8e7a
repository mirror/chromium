      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is quite specific enough.  For instance, this says that most things run on the UI thread before and after the installer runs, but Install() posts a task to the UI thread - implying it\u0027s not already on the UI thread.  I\u0027d prefer we document each method with where it should be running/called from.",
