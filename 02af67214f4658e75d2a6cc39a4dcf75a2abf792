      "message": "Oh yeah, I should have commented on this: It\u0027s not a 100% no-op refactor: The old code did not transfer the colorspace information. So, I just fixed it while I was in here to help support other efforts \"on the colorspace front.\" But, otherwise, no-op.\n\nAs for the BGRA format aspect (the color type set by MakeN32()), this is guaranteed because on line 364, there is a check for that in the source image. So, by copying over that part of the SkImageInfo as well, the same format should be used in the result.",
