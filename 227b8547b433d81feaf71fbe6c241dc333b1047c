I\u0027ve just checked that on url_unittests running in 3 different configurations:\n\n1) ./url_unittests\n\n2) ./url_unittests --test-launcher-jobs\u003d1\n\n3) ./url_unittests --test-launcher-jobs\u003d1 --single-process-tests\n\nThe coverage results are the same. I\u0027m not 100% sure that it would work for any test, so I\u0027m going to run ~30 different unittests without any special options and see if all of them work.",

      "message": "Well, we actually need that flag. It seems that some large tests run many jobs, and each of those could run multiple processes. The coverage might work even without that flag, but it needs too much disk space. For instance, I tried to run:\n\n1) cc_unittests: it created ~300 files 55 MB each, took 16 GB in total\n\n2) components_unittests: it runs 56 jobs, multiple processed per each, and single profraw file is about 900MB",
