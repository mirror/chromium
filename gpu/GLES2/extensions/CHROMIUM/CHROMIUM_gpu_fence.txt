Overview

    This extension supports cross-process GL context synchronization.

    A "gpu fence" represents a synchronization point in a GL stream that can be
    duplicated into a paired gpu fence in another unrelated GL stream. A server
    wait on the duplicate ensures that the commands on the source stream have
    executed. The gpu fence is a reference to a platform-dependent native GL
    fence object.

    This supports two use cases:

    * Create a client-side gpu fence from a native GL fence object, duplicate
      it into a service-side gpu fence, and issue a server wait on the service
      side.

    * Create a new service-side gpu fence, request a duplicated client-side gpu
      fence via callback, create a native GL fence object from that and do a
      server wait on the client.

    IPC transport is based on a "gpu fence handle" which can be converted
    to/from a gpu fence, but the details of this are out of scope for this
    extension.

    See also the ANDROID_native_fence_sync extension which is used to
    implement the GLFenceEGLNativeSync class on Android.

New Procedures and Functions

    The command

        GLuint gl->CreateGpuFenceCHROMIUM()

    creates a new service side gpu fence and inserts a matching synchronization
    point into the command stream. It returns a gpu fence ID that is used for
    subsequent operations.

    The command

        ContextSupport()->GetGpuFenceHandle(
            GLuint gpu_fence_id,
            const base::Callback<void(const gfx::GpuFenceHandle&)>&)

    extracts a gpu fence handle from the service-side gpu fence and passes
    it to the provided callback function asynchronously. The callback can use
    this handle to create a paired client-side gpu fence. Use this on
    a service side gpu fence that was created with CreateGpuFenceCHROMIUM. (I
    think it'll actually work in the Android implementation even if ignoring
    this restriction, but not sure if it's a good idea to assume that. 3-way
    synchronization or similar seems out of scope.)

    The command

        GLuint gl->DuplicateGpuFenceCHROMIUM(ClientGpuFence source)

    creates a service-side gpu fence that is synchronized with the supplied
    client-side gpu fence. It returns a gpu fence ID.

    The command

        void gl->WaitGpuFenceCHROMIUM(EGLint gpu_fence_id)

    issues a server wait. Use this on a gpu fence that was duplicated from a
    client GPU fence to ensure that operations are synchronized with the source
    gpu fence that provided the gpu fence handle.

    The command

        void gl->DestroyGpuFenceCHROMIUM(EGLint gpu_fence_id)

    destroys the specified service side gpu fence and invalidates the
    gpu_fence_id. A gpu fence that was duplicated from it remains valid, and it
    is not necessary to wait for the asynchronous callback to execute before
    destroying the service side gpu fence.

    A usage example for two-process synchronization is to sequence access to a
    globally shared drawable such as an AHardwareBuffer on Android, where the
    writer uses a local GL context and the reader is a command buffer context
    in the GPU process. The writer process draws into an AHardwareBuffer-backed
    GLImage in the local GL context, then creates a gpu fence to mark the end
    of drawing operations:

        // ... write to the shared drawable in local context, then create
        // a local fence.
        gl::GLFenceEGLNativeSync local_fence;

        // Get a GpuFence from it via handle.
        gpu::GpuFence gpu_fence(
            local_fence->GetGpuFenceHandle());
        // It's ok for local_fence to be destroyed at this point.

        // Create a matching gpu fence on the command buffer context, issue
        // server wait, and destroy it.
        EGLint id = gl->DuplicateGpuFenceCHROMIUM(&gpu_fence);
        gl->WaitGpuFenceCHROMIUM(id);
        gl->DestroyGpuFenceCHROMIUM(id);

        // ... read from the shared drawable via command buffer. These reads
        // will happen after the local_fence has signalled. The local
        // fence doesn't need to remain alive for this.

    If a process wants to consume a drawable that was produced through a
    command buffer context in the GPU process, the sequence is as follows:

        // Set up callback that's waiting for the drawable to be ready.
        void callback(const gpu::GpuFenceHandle& handle) {
            // Create a local context GL fence from the GpuFence.
            std::unique_ptr<gl::GLFence> local_fence =
                gl::GLFence::CreateFromGpuFenceHandle(handle);
            local_fence->ServerWait();
            // ... read from the shared drawable in the local context.
        }

        // ... write to the shared drawable via command buffer, then
        // create a gpu fence:
        EGLint id = gl->CreateGpuFenceCHROMIUM();
        ContextSupport()->GetGpuFenceDuplicate(id, callback);
        gl->DestroyGpuFenceCHROMIUM(id);

    It is legal to create the GpuFence on a separate command buffer context
    instead of on the command buffer channel that did the drawing operations,
    but in that case gl->WaitSyncTokenCHROMIUM() or equivalent must be used to
    sequence the operations between the distinct command buffer contexts as
    usual.
