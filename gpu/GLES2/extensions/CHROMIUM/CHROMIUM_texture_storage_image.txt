    OpenGL ES Extension #???

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification.
    This extension depends on EXT_texture_storage.
    CHROMIUM_schedule_ca_layer affects the definition of this extension.
    EXT_texture_format_BGRA8888 affects the definition of this extension.

Overview

    This allows clients to specify alternative texture backings which support
    scanout and can be used as hardware overlays.

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <bufferusage> parameter of glTexStorage2DImageCHROMIUM:
    GL_SCANOUT_CHROMIUM 0x6000

New Procedures and Functions

    The command

        void TexStorage2DImageCHROMIUM(enum target, enum internalformat,
                                       enum bufferusage, sizei width,
                                       sizei height);

    specifies that the (single) level of the texture is backed by a platform
    image buffer with the specified usage. The only supported buffer usage is
    SCANOUT_CHROMIUM which allows the texture to be used for scanout and in
    hardware overlays. The only supported internal formats for scanout are
    RGBA8_OES, BGRA8_EXT, and RGBAF16_EXT.

Dependencies on CHROMIUM_schedule_ca_layer

    Textures specified using TexStorage2DImageCHROMIUM with usage
    SCANOUT_CHROMIUM may be used with ScheduleCALayerCHROMIUM.
    SetColorSpaceForScanoutCHROMIUM maybe used for specifying the color space of
    scanout textures.

Dependencies on EXT_texture_format_BGRA8888

    If EXT_texture_format_BGRA8888 is not supported, delete any reference to
    BGRA8_EXT.

Errors

    A context lost will result when this call fails, either because of an
    invalid parameter value or because of a runtime error such as an out of
    memory condition.
