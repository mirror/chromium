      "message": "This might change how often this call runs. For example, if you do OOBE and then login, I think it gets called twice? Also, if you do crash-and-restore (--login-user) then I think chrome will skip the login screen and this will never run. It looks like in the old code this was guaranteed to be called exactly once. Do you know if it\u0027s OK to change that?",

      "message": "ActivateKeyboard a no-op if it gets called more than once with the same KeyboardController instance.\n\nThis gets called with state \u003d\u003d ACTIVE after a crash which calls CreateKeyboard which both re-creates KeyboardController and calls ActivateKeyboard().\n\nI think that the reason we were doing this in multiple places before was historical / code evolution, but it was confusing.",
