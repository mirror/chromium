      "message": "We talked about this offline a bit and even investigated another approach handling this exclusively in the scroll tree. I think we sort of came back to special-casing this logic for viewport layers where the page scale layer is sandwiched between the inner container and inner scroll layers (with an optional translation-only overscroll elasticity layer).\n\nIn the latest patch I\u0027ve added DCHECKs in RegisterViewportLayers that the page scale layer is between the inner viewport layers. A few tests needed updating.",
