      "message": "I\u0027m considering this new domain only a temporary home for BeginFrame related commands (a place where we can experiment and shape them, thus \"experimental\" in the name of the domain) - since we are aiming to support them in non-headless mode eventually too. (See also earlier discussion about the domain name in this review - an alternative would be to put these commands into the emulation domain - or another new domain that isn\u0027t headless-specific). Virtual time is not a headless-specific feature either, so moving it to HeadlessExperimental doesn\u0027t seem a good fit. If we can come up with a good name for a new domain for BeginFrameControl / virtual time, I wouldn\u0027t be opposed to moving them there.\n\nI intend to make it possible to pass virtual times to the BeginFrame command - right now, that\u0027s still rather tricky because we don\u0027t know the renderer\u0027s virtual time stamp from the devtools client.",
