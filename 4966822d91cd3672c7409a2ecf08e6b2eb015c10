      "message": "I think we had a similar discussion on this subject with hidehiko@ on another CL. This style aligns with the choice we made there not to return the requests directly in the spirit of treating the fake like a fake (i.e. see the two functions above, get_id_for_disk_migrated_to_dircrypto(), etc.)\n\nI agree that the name is a bit long but I think it is a compromise between conciseness and clarity, with this particular case leaning more toward the clarity side at the expense of conciseness :)",
