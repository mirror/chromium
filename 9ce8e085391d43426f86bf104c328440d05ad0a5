      "message": "As we were discussing offline, I think that checking the primaries are counter clockwise might be a better check.\nIt would catch this specific issue (IIUC), and it would also allow us to have primaries where the green can go all the way up and left of the blue.\n\nIf you prefer this, I\u0027m ok with this solution too.",

      "message": "Daniele, are you talking about the 210T? It has the primaries in the right order AFAIU. But maybe I don\u0027t understand what you want to do. Or maybe the \"specific issue\" is another issue.\n\n\nIn any case, I\u0027m not sure that the \"fBX \u003c fGX\" is a good heuristic. Looking at X on this diagram:\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/CIE1931xy_CIERGB.svg/325px-CIE1931xy_CIERGB.svg.png\nit\u0027s not far fetched to imagine a green and blue with the same X value, or a green point with a smaller X than the blue point; the more recent standards have been pushing the green point further to the left while blue is mostly unchanged.\n\n\nIntuitively, I would remove the \"fBX \u003c fGX\" check but also add something which checks that the triangle area is big enough. For example it should be at least 80% of the size of the BT709 one or something like that.",
