      "message": "KeyedService are destroyed in two phases.\n\nFirst all services, in reverse dependency order, the ShutDown method is invoked. Then the services are destroyed in a non guaranteed order (it just happen to be the same in current implementation). This mean that a service should not use another KeyedService it depends on after it the ShutDown method call.\n\nHere by the point LogoServiceImpl::SigninObserver unregister itself from GaiaCookieManagerService, the service may already have been destroyed. Instead, the call to RemoveObserver should be done in LogoServiceImpl::ShutDown(), either by adding a method to unregister to the observer or by deleting the destructor.\n\nTL;DR: I recommend adding an explicit \"signin_observer_.reset();\" in \"LogoServiceImpl::ShutDown()\".",
