      "message": "The only worry is that some View will override this, and not call back to this base impl, which does the actual work.\n\nOne possible mitigation is to keep this non-virtual, but have a no-op virtual method (e.g. OnAccessibilityEvent(...)), which Views can override to get notified when an AX event is sent.\n\nAnother approach is to install a test-implementation of ViewsDelegate in the test, and use that to validate that the right AX event is sent at the right time.",
