      "message": "Ideally we should use the element\u0027s dimension (the actual \u003cinput/\u003e) and caret bounds to resovle this. Right now the issue with using the method is that if the user has zoomed in, tapping the input will actually zoom out a bit. Also if the \u003cinput/\u003e is too wide or long, or caret is further away from top-left (or it is a Right-to-Left font) we might have issues here.",
