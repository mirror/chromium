      "message": "This comment is still valid, unit tests may still supply null.\n\nI updated the comment in the header. My change isn\u0027t to more broadly allow local state to be null, rather to create local state before g_browser_process, in which case you can\u0027t do g_browser_process-\u003elocal_state(), instead what becomes g_browser_process-\u003elocal_state() must be passed in. That\u0027s the motivation for this change. I\u0027ve split this off from a bigger patch in hopes of making it easier to review.

If this is created early in the flow, however, you say that it might not be a real pointer to g_browser_process-\u003elocal_state().  Won\u0027t this mean you\u0027re caching the wrong value, and thus the wrong value will get used on this IsConsentGiven()?\n\nGiven all my questions, I have to ask: have you tested this change?",
