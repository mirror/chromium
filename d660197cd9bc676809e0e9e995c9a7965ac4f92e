My change isn\u0027t to more broadly allow local state to be null, rather to create local state before g_browser_process, in which case you can\u0027t do g_browser_process-\u003elocal_state(), instead what becomes g_browser_process-\u003elocal_state() must be passed in. That\u0027s the motivation for this change. I\u0027ve split this off from a bigger patch in hopes of making it easier to review.
