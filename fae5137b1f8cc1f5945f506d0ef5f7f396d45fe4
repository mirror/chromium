      "message": "The execution counter created for beyond the return statement inherits its end position from its parent range - i.e. in this case the end of the function.\n\nThe count itself is 0 (since execution cannot reach the point beyond the return statement), and therefore the closing brace is shown as uncovered.\n\nI\u0027ve been thinking about this myself, and I suppose it\u0027d make the display less noisy if closing braces would be shown as covered in such cases. I\u0027ll cook something up tomorrow.",
