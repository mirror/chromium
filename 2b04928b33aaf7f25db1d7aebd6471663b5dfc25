      "message": "The phrasing of this was striking me as a little weird and I think it\u0027s because I\u0027m used to using the imperative tense (or mood? is imperative a mood?) in docstrings and it looks like based on PEP257 that\u0027s what\u0027s recommended:\n\nhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/\n\n\"The docstring is a phrase ending in a period. It prescribes the function or method\u0027s effect as a command (\"Do this\", \"Return that\"), not as a description; e.g. don\u0027t write \"Returns the pathname ...\".\"",

      "message": "Huh, that\u0027s a good point.\n\nTechnically the Chromium and Blink Python style guides (https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/styleguide/styleguide.md, https://www.chromium.org/blink/coding-style) just say \"use pep8, with one or two exceptions\" and neither mention docstrings. And PEP8 recommends adhering to PEP257 for docstrings.\n\nBUT, all of the examples in the Google style guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Comments) use third-person singular form (e.g. Returns, checks, constructs...), and that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been using.\n\n\nAnyway, so I think the overall rule should be: just keep the verbs consistent within a file.",
