      "message": "The phrasing of this was striking me as a little weird and I think it\u0027s because I\u0027m used to using the imperative tense (or mood? is imperative a mood?) in docstrings and it looks like based on PEP257 that\u0027s what\u0027s recommended:\n\nhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/\n\n\"The docstring is a phrase ending in a period. It prescribes the function or method\u0027s effect as a command (\"Do this\", \"Return that\"), not as a description; e.g. don\u0027t write \"Returns the pathname ...\".\"",
