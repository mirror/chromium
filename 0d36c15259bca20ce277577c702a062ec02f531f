      "message": "It looks to me like this is more of a \"condition we expect to be true when this method is called\" kind of DCHECK rather than a \"condition that MUST be true when this method is called\" kind. In which case, I\u0027ve added a new use case under which this method will be called that doesn\u0027t satisfy this expectation so I should just remove it. But again, if I\u0027ve missed some reason why calling this when the text field isn\u0027t the first responder is dangerous, please let me know.",
