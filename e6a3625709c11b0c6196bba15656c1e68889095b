      "message": "I believe this DCHECK is there because OnRequestFailedInternal would show an error page only relevant to canceled requests with net::ERR_ABORTED. So I think checking if there is an error page provided would make sense. But I need to double check this. The DCHECK came from nick@ in a patch[1] that introduced different types of net errors but there are no comments about the DCHECK. Do you happen to know its purpose?\n\n[1] https://codereview.chromium.org/2867833002/",
