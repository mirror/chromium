This might also lead to flaky asan tests if some other component in StoragePartition takes a bit longer at some point.\nThe call to StoragePartition is happening here: \n https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/extensions/data_deleter.cc?l\u003d73\u0026rcl\u003d70d7b68f1669306da4c713c7e4d4b0be97a13ab8",
