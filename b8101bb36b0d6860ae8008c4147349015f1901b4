      "message": "We currently compile fuchsia with headless ozone backend, and headless currently supports Mesa, but not Swiftshader. We will look into enabling swiftshader in the future, e.g. when we switch to a real ozone platform impl instead of headless, but I\u0027m not sure we will want to use ozone on Fuchsia long-term. I\u0027m also not sure we will need SW rendering on Fuchsia at all. This change is necessary short-term mainly to get layout tests running.",

But we will need to take close look into what ozone requires from a platform and if it\u0027s compatible with what\u0027s provided in Fuchsia. Also on Fuchsia UI shell is replaceable, so what works for Armadillo may not work for other shells.\n\n\u003e Is there any performance/compatibility reason that Headless might prefer to use Mesa over Swiftshader?\n\nAFAICT it\u0027s just because headless was implemented before swiftshader was added to chromium.",
