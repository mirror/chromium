      "message": "We currently compile fuchsia with headless ozone backend, and headless currently supports Mesa, but not Swiftshader. We will look into enabling swiftshader in the future, e.g. when we switch to a real ozone platform impl instead of headless, but I\u0027m not sure we will want to use ozone on Fuchsia long-term. I\u0027m also not sure we will need SW rendering on Fuchsia at all. This change is necessary short-term mainly to get layout tests running.",
