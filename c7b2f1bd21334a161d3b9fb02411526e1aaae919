      "message": "We should discourage use of \"Host\" naming for interfaces -- I\u0027ve explicitly avoided it in docs -- because it doesn\u0027t *really* make sense anymore.\n\nMojo interfaces are not intended to prescribe where their endpoints live. Even things which seem naturally privileged (e.g. file access) can sometimes be implemented in an unprivileged context (e.g. without fetching real file contents), and the existence one implementation certainly doesn\u0027t preclude the existence of others.\n\nSo all that\u0027s to say that I\u0027d prefer we call this a Logger instead of a LoggerHost, just like we\u0027d call a file interface File instead of FileHost. I would probably just leave \"Host\" NOTE out of the doc altogether, as I think it may be confusing or redundant in light of the above rationale.\n\n... alternatively, you could leave the note but also add something like the above rationale to explain why we\u0027ve deviated from the \"Host\" convention, but that may be too much information.",
