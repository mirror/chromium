      "message": "Two things to think about to improve reliability during flaky network conditions:\n1) Porting over the reconnect-on-error logic from the extension will help keep the sink around instead of waiting for next signal from mDNS.\n2) Dynamically adjusting the connect timeout / ping timeout values for a reconnect could help in some cases. Since this is speculative, it might be best to implement this under an experiment and observe whether metrics show a positive impact (e.g. channel open success rate, ping timeout rate, etc.)",
