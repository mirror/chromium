      "message": "I think I\u0027d meant for that TODO applied to the whole block? I forget. I think it was something about how downstream code in Blink also had its own copy of redirect-processing logic and needed to be kept in sync. I think ResourceLoader::WillFollowRedirect? Though that doesn\u0027t seem to bother with headers? At the time I was working through how //net and Blink or so had a copy of the logic which decided when to switch POST to GET on redirect (should be fixed now with net::RedirectInfo).\n\nI dunno, at this point you\u0027re probably more familiar with this mess than me. Is there anything more to be done there?",
