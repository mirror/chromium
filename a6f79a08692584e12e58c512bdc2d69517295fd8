      "message": "I\u0027m a bit concerned with the dependency between IsAdResource() and AllowLoad()/CanRequest(). (This kind of ordering constraint can be fragile and might be broken in the future)\n\nHow about placing the single-entry cache in GetLoadPolicy() (in GetLoadPolicy() if the key doesn\u0027t match then recalculate the result rather than simply returning false) and calling just GetLoadPolicy() here?\nBy doing so, the correctness is not affected by the calling order (the performance is still affected though).",
