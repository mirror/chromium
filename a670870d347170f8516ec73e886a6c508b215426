      "message": "I think it\u0027s missing a test where one SQS has an invertible transform, then the next doesn\u0027t, cuz this transform would get left as non-empty and get used but the 2nd SQS could have a different transform getting wrong results. tl;dr there should be an else here, and looks like we need a test :)",

      "message": "I believe all the scale and translation matrices are invertible. The reason i added this if statement is because GetInverse requires the caller to use the return value. https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/gfx/transform.h?type\u003dcs\u0026q\u003dGetInverse\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d177\n\nI will change the if statement to a DCHECK statement to make this more clear. I also added a test here as requested.",
