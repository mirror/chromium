      "message": "Not-code-related: If user has display off after locking, and then press power button to stop forcing off. Then I believe user has to unlock the device to redo display off after locking? I am wondering whether we can just make display off when power button is pressed/released on locked state.\nFor two reasons:\n(1) power button is no-op when screen is locked and not off.\n(2) I don\u0027t think it is annoying that power button makes display off when screen is already locked. As user already has to unlock the device to use the device.",
