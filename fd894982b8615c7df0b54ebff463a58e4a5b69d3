      "message": "I feel that these rules are too magical. Given \"HTTPEntry9E2EFooBar\" to human beings, they probably don\u0027t know what is the correct way to split either. :) Why \"E2EFoo\" should be grouped as \"E2E_Foo\", but not \"E2_E_Foo\"?\n\nI am not sure whether the following is a better approach, but I will throw it out for consideration:\n- If the name already has \"_\" in it, split using the \"_\".\n- Otherwise, split before each capital character.\n\nI think according to our style guide, people should always use XmlHttpRequest instead of XMLHTTPRequest anyway. So the rule-2 above should be good enough.\n\nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.3-camel-case\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "The previous rules here made little assumptions about what sorts of inputs we could get (based on the example on the comments). If there\u0027s such a guarantee that names will either be camel case or macro case, then things get easier.\n\nThe new patch implements both rules you suggested, so we cover macro case, snake case, camel case. Anything non standard will produce undefined results.",
