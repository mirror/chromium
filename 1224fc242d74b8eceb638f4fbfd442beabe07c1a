      "message": "\"get high priority always?\" - I hope so. :)\n\n\"make sure [...] short duration\" - That would make perfect sense for my use case. I would want to wait for agreement among the various code owners, though, since this implements a public interface and so I\u0027m not sure how appropriate it would be to restrict it this way. As said, for my specific use that makes a lot of sense.",
