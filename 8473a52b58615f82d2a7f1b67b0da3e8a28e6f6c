      "message": "I\u0027m a little concerned about the performance of this. While this list isn\u0027t likely to be very large for now, I could imagine it growing significantly over time.\n\nAlso, it looks like we are getting the List from the pref store each time in  GetLockScreenSupportForChromeApp() below, which is probably just a memory lookup, but it\u0027s hard to be sure.\n\nI think it would be worth to cache the pref contents as a set\u003cstring\u003e ids, and update the set if the pref changes. For a little extra setup, the runtime code will be simplified and will remain fast.\n\nWDYT?",
