And we are suggesting the password without having a strong guess. I don\u0027t know if this was discussed before but I think it is important to take this into consideration.\n\nI remember there was going to be some logic to select the last-edited password among three. Is that still a thing? If so, everything here LGTM. :)",

So, we will not make worse. \n\nMoreover, I hope we will launch password selection anyway :) \n\nabout last edited password: manual fallback will save the form where last edit happened. But order of field edits doesn\u0027t affect on heuristics. I am preparing a CL where only fields with user input are considered.",
