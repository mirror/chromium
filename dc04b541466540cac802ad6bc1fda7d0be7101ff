      "message": "One regression here for multicol, if it has inline children. If box_fragment is the multicol container, its children will be columns (with lines inside), so we\u0027re not going to create the necessary RootInlineBox objects, since columns obviously aren\u0027t line boxes.\n\nTest:\n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"width:500px; columns:3; column-fill:auto; height:100px;\"\u003e\n    Hello world\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nUsed to generate this fragment tree:\n\n.:: LayoutNG Physical Fragment Tree ::.\n  Box offset:0,0 size:800x116\n    Box offset:8,8 size:784x100\nM     Box offset:0,0 size:500x100\nC       Box offset:0,0 size:156x20\nI         Box (anonymous) offset:0,0 size:76x20\nL           LineBox offset:0,0 size:76x20\n              Text offset:0,0 size:76x20 start: 0 end: 11\n\nWith this patch it generates this fragment tree:\n\n.:: LayoutNG Physical Fragment Tree ::.\n  Box offset:0,0 size:800x116\n    Box offset:8,8 size:784x100\nM     Box offset:0,0 size:500x100\nC       Box offset:0,0 size:156x20\nL         LineBox offset:0,0 size:76x20\n            Text offset:0,0 size:76x20 start: 0 end: 11\n\nPreviously we\u0027d get to this code via the fragment marked with \"I\".
