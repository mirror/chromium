      "message": "The original code had always worked under the assumption that text_color was always the enabled text color, whatever that was. The explicit setting of the disabled color above causes label()-\u003eenabled_color() to actually be the disabled color.\n\nMaybe that is the actual issue here? If the disabled color is left in, all the alpha constants would need to be adjusted for the disabled state. That seems to be getting more complicated. Maybe we should look at adding something to the layout or typography providers?",
