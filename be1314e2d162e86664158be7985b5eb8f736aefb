      "message": "Thanks for putting this together. Looking at this, it\u0027s going to get unmaintainable pretty quickly - and sort of is already. Could you please try this:\n\n1) Define a variable like WIN_NVIDIA_GEFORCE_610_STABLE_DRIVER at the top of the file\n2) Reference that instead of \u002710de:104a-21.21.13.7254\u0027 in the swarming_dimensions of all of the testers\n3) Define another variable like WIN_NVIDIA_GEFORCE_610_ALL_DRIVERS containing \u002710de:104a-*\u0027\n4) Reference that variable in the swarming_dimensions of all of the tests\n5) Modify the matching rules in matches_swarming_dimensions to do a more complex match. It can\u0027t simply use issubset any more, but needs to iterate down dimensions.items() and see whether it ends in \u0027*\u0027, and if so, do a prefix match on the entries in cur_dims.\n\nThanks.",
