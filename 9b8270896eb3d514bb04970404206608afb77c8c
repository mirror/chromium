      "message": "I\u0027m trying to figure out what we could tell with these UMAs. For Finch-control group we will see 0 throttled counts, and for enabled group unthrottled UMA should look similar to control group... or since we categorize these by the time when peak usage is recorded, and since some pages might finish being loaded while the tab is backgrounded we might expect smaller numbers?  Do we want to also record the stats when the tab becomes foregrounded for the first time?",

Was trying to make sense the other way.\n\n\u003e \u003e Do we want to also record the stats when the tab becomes foregrounded for the first time?\n\u003e \n\u003e Could you elaborate a bit why this is useful?\n\nI have wondered if we\u0027re interested in how peak memory could differ between control and others for the pages that were started (mostly) in background but then brought to foreground later. \nSay, could it be useful to record peak count for the frames that are not throttled when OnNetworkQuiet is called (while it might have been throttled) in a single bucket?",
