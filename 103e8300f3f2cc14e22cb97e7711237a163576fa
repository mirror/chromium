      "message": "|buffer_format| should be ignored if |is_overlay_candidate| is false, like in this case.\nI\u0027m not against this change, but I\u0027d rather set it to something like BufferFormat::UNKNOWN, than trying to infer buffer format from the resource format.\n\nFor example, we could have a resource that is R_8 and it is using a texture backed by an RGBX buffer. We\u0027d be incorrect in that case.\n\nMaybe |buffer_format| should be of type  Optional\u003cBufferFormat\u003e?\nWhat do you think about that?",
