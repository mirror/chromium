If we call add and remove multiple times (i.e. for each AnimationTicker which is ticking) we will add the player to the ticking_players_ list once and then think that the player is no longer ticking after the first ticker stops ticking and calls RemoveFromTicking.",

      "message": "It seems to me that since we always get tickers from players that the ticker id\u0027s don\u0027t need to be globally unique. I also assume that we rarely delete tickers without also deleting players and often there will only be one ticker so perhaps it would probably make more sense to save a ticker index and use a flat array of tickers on the player to reduce memory consumption and lookup time.",
