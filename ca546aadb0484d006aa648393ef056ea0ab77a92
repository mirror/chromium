This way, such a CL shouldn\u0027t be committed.\n\nAlso, can you add test coverage for this - i.e. with some example file contents (including finding interesting dates and invalid dates like Feb 29 on years where there isn\u0027t such a date) and check that the code handles them as expected? (i.e. gives error on invalid ones and parses valid ones correctly.)",
