If so, then you can\u0027t land this change until the server-side is deployed.\n\nI would suggest that you pass the entire field response here and then have it check server_predictions and fall back to field-\u003eserver_type(). I.e., it needs to support both the old and the new response format in the interim. Maybe add a TODO + crbug to remove support for the old after the server-side change is deemed stable.",
