      "message": "FWIW, I think we could simplify all of these with a function which constructs the appropriate test case, e.g.:\n\n// Construct a 20x20 sticky position element stuck to the given edge with given offset within a 100x100 container\n// within a 200x200 viewport scroller within a 500x500 scrollable area.\nconst elements \u003d setupStickyTest(\u0027bottom\u0027, 10 /* sticky offset */);\nelements.scroller.scrollTop \u003d ##;\nassert_equals(elements.sticky.offsetTop, ##); // default offsettop is known to be 240 (centered within container).\n\nDoes this make sense? I think it might make the tests more readable to be based on the same known geometry.",
