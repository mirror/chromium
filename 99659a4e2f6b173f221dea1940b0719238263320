      "message": "@agrieve: I pulled this back in (albeit in a different form) after hitting an error in a follow-on CL w/ overwriting files copied here. CIPD stores files as read-only and then creates symlinks to them in the source tree; copying them here results in read-only files in the temp directory. This creates problems when trying to overwrite an existing file. Granting write permissions to copied files both fixes those issues and ensures that we don\u0027t have stale files.",
