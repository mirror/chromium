      "message": "I think this may break telemetry and perf tests that rely on self._test_instance.package_info.cmdline_file for setting flags.\n\nPut another way, I think an issue with this change may be that we\u0027re assuming we\u0027re always running these packages in a \"testing mode\" but that\u0027s not always the case. These packages are also used for monitoring performance and I *think* this now may be inconsistently set",
