      "message": "\u003e Intentional empty group?\n\nI thought: I want the first target in here to either depend on all of Crashpad, or be harmless. I didn’t want someone to accidentally depend on //third_party/crashpad/crashpad and have it take on a dependency on just the tests.\n\nI couldn’t figure out how to mix deps with wildcards to pick up everything under //third_party/crashpad/crashpad, and I didn’t want to maintain the list of everything here manually, so I settled on “nothing.”\n\nIs there a common pattern for this kind of thing? Or should I provide some sort of comment?",
