Hosted apps are like regular tabs: they live in tabs, they do not have dedicated extension process. Yet they will have an entry in ProcessMap for other reasons.",

I know you already talked to someone from the extensions team, can you get them to review this part to confirm this reports the number we\u0027re interested in?",
