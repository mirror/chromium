      "message": "To make this consistent with how the other commands work, please add a new command enum to BattOrAgent::Action (FLUSH_CONNECTION) so that the state machine accurately reflects the state of things. Basically, any time that the battor agent has to cede control of the processor because it\u0027s waiting the result of an async task, last_action_ should accurately reflect what it\u0027s waiting on.\n\nAs you have it now, when OnConnectionFlushed looks at the last action performed, it sees that it was Action::REQUEST_CONNECTION. However, the last thing done wasn\u0027t really the request of the connection, it was the request of the flush. We really want the state machine to line up with the last_action_ field.",
