      "message": "The idea (dating from https://crbug.com/140076) was that code which requires secure randomness must use crypto::RandBytes, even though that\u0027s a dumb wrapper around base::RandBytes which is secretly secure random, in order to make code that depends on secure randomness easily discoverable (perhaps in case base::RandBytes was ever refactored to stop being secure? or maybe just so that everything security sensitive can be audited by searching for \"crypto/\"?).\n\nI agree though that this made the header comments rather misleading. I\u0027ve changed the header comment for base::RandBytes to explain this more clearly, and as a result I\u0027ve removed the comments in the .cc files since they are now redundant (as well as repetitive).",
