      "message": "That\u0027s a better idea, since the BarBanner would be able to show more than 2 lines of text. However, from what I understand, all measurements of overlay panels are calculated in Java and are passed to C++. If we dynamically change a parameter here (e.g. search_bar_banner_height), there\u0027ll be inconsistency between Java and C++.\n\nIf we are to do this in Java, we\u0027ll face a different problem. The height of the TextView is calculated after the view is drawn. That process happens asynchronously on the UI thread and we should set a callback to get the calculated height. However, ContextualSearchBarBannerControl#getHeightPeekingPx(), which requires the peeking height of the bar banner, is called before the callback method is called.\n\nThere\u0027s definitely a (non-trivial) way to solve this problem, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s worth the effort, since it\u0027s highly unlikely that we need more than 2 lines in the BarBanner.",
