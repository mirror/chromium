      "message": "This block is an optimization to push a 2D offset into the geometry map instead of an entire matrix.\n\nThe multiply at 1326 is multiplying the transform from GetTransformFromContainer, and it\u0027s pushing a transform into the geometry map. The code in this block is applying the container_offset translation to the 2D translate pulled out of the skipped ancestor matrix, and pushing a 2D offset into the geometry map. I presume that\u0027s the by far most common case and the most efficient one. It\u0027s basically doing what the old line 1312 did but using values from a matrix instead of the old skipped ancestor adjustment offset.\n\nI could change the code to look more like the old line 1312.\n\nIf it\u0027s really not so bad to always push a matrix onto the geometry map, then this block is functionally identical to the one that follows and I would merge it with that.",
