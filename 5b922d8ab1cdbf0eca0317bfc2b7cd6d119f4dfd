      "message": "This can be removed from here. But in my subsequent CL, I do need the transforms to be initialized.\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/708044/24/ash/display/touch_calibrator_controller_unittest.cc#336\n\nTouch events when generated by a touch device, have a root transform applied. The root transform here is selected based on which display the touch device is associated with. The association itself is stored in the TouchDeviceTransforms. So i would need a way to initialize the transforms in my subsequent CL where I would be checking if the root transform is properly modified and applied.",
