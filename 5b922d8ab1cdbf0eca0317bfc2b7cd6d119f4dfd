      "message": "I could add another test API to InputDeviceManager to support this. However, this code isn\u0027t needed for the test to pass and I\u0027d prefer to keep that interface simple. The current test expectations seem sufficient to exercise the controller.",

      "message": "This can be removed from here. But in my subsequent CL, I do need the transforms to be initialized.\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/708044/24/ash/display/touch_calibrator_controller_unittest.cc#336\n\nTouch events when generated by a touch device, have a root transform applied. The root transform here is selected based on which display the touch device is associated with. The association itself is stored in the TouchDeviceTransforms. So i would need a way to initialize the transforms in my subsequent CL where I would be checking if the root transform is properly modified and applied.",
