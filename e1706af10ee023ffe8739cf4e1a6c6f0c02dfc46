      "message": "Should we delete but not recreate at this point and/or stop trying to commit changes? Maybe have a WrapperImpl::ResetDatabase() method that nulls out the ptr and delete\u0027s any pending commit_batch in there. I think that would prevent it from even trying to commit. And when creating new wrappers, give them null database_ ptrs.\n\nWell, then again, I guess we could be able to read w/o being able to write, so we wouldn\u0027t want to null it.",
