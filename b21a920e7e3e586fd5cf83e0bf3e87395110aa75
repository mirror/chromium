      "message": "+kkhorimoto@ as owner of this file.\nI changed the execution of dismissing first run and showing settings from parallel to sequential. I believe that it is more deterministic this way. For example, we can be certain that the baseViewController does not have a presentedViewController.\nI have checked for visual differences with this change, and have not noticed any difference with my untrained eye. I also ran all the first_run_egtests.mm and they passed.",

Eventually we\u0027re going to have a better generalized solution when this is all done via coordinators, but in the meantime this will help with stability by avoiding unintended no-op presentations when attempting to present while something else is being dismissed.",
