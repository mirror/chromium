      "message": "I think that splitting this up into two sentences like this is risky. It might look to a translator that \"Header of an error page.\" is a full description (and perhaps that this is the string used for every \"error page\").\n\nIn addition, the second sentence right now is general context that can apply to every interstitial string. I think it would be good to be a little more specific, e.g. by referring to AV or firewalls as an example.",
