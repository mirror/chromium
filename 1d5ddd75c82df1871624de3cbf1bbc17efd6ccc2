      "message": "Comment added for +.\n\nI mostly kept them separate because the kernel args were distinct other than autorun. But looking at them, I\u0027m don\u0027t think there\u0027s any good reason for that, so I homogenized them. Hopefully that doesn\u0027t cause any trouble.\n\nAnd then I was trying to diagnose why there seemed to be a spurious \u0027-o\u0027 being passed to the kernel for device mode, and it turns out bootserver doesn\u0027t (any more?) want -o, just everything after the -- is a kernel arg, so I removed my clever formulation of inserting -o as every second thing in a list, and it got simpler.\n\nIt also looks like \"kernel.halt_on_panic\" is supposed to be spelled \"kernel.halt-on-panic\" (docs/hacking.md mentions the _ version, but the code only tries to retrieve a - version), but I\u0027m going to leave that for now and follow up on the Fuchsia side to confirm/fix the docs first.\n\nIn summary:\n- added the autorun;\n- made qemu also get the nodename and epoch;\n- halt_on_panic is probably a no-op either way.",
