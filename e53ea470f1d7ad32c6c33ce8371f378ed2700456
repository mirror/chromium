Options:\n1. Don\u0027t do any copying, remove the \u0027clear all\u0027 operation, and we\u0027re done (con - if we\u0027re changing the prefix to one that is already used then that data isn\u0027t cleared)\n2. Same as 1, but we keep the \u0027clear all\u0027 operation, to clear any data that was previously at the new prefix.\n\nWDYT?",
