However, we may not need to do this for all tests in this file.\n\nThe linux try bot does a separate run of content_browsertests with --site-per-process (and we\u0027re adding a waterfall bot for it to replace that), so I think it\u0027s probably safe to proceed without adding the flag and rely on that coverage.",

The NavigateIframeToURL call above will only necessarily wait for the first commit, and not necessarily for #pass to be added.\n\nIs this why some of the tests above have NavigateToURLBlockUntilNavigationsComplete(shell(), test_url, 2);?
