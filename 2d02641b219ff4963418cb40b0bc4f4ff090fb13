I\u0027ve edited the CL description.\n\n\u003e In fact, it might be worth including a test that a cookie request from bar.com for isolated.foo.com kills the bar.com renderer.\n\nYou\u0027re right - I\u0027ve added new tests: IsolatedOriginTest.*CookieEnforcement_NonIsolatedAccessingIsolated.  The tests are more-or-less duplicated from RenderFrameMessageFilterBrowserTest.CrossSiteCookieSecurityEnforcement except that here we are testing isolated-vs-non-isolated origins (rather than generic cross-site access under site-per-process).",

I worder the TODO in terms of extension isolation, but I am not sure what other things need enforcement (do CWS, default search engine, WebUI get locked origin?).
