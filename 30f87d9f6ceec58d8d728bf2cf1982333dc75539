The existing markup still gets removed even if we call Abort() here (I am not sure why). What should our behavior here be? Our options are:\n\n1. Remove the selected markup and end up not being able to insert the replacement character\n2. Don\u0027t change the selected markup at all\n\nand neither of these is ideal.",
