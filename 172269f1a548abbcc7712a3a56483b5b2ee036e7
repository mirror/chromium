GlobalScope is not thread-safe and it\u0027s generally discouraged to access it from a non-context thread. To post a task to the context thread, we need to...\n\n1) take context\u0027s task runner on the context thread and then pass it to the non-context thread, OR\n2) take context\u0027s task runner in some thread-safe way.
