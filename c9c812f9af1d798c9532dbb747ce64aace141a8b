      "message": "This is also potentially extremely slow, and presumably needs ScopedBlockingCall.\n\nWhat is the consequence of *not* marking blocking code with that?\nPretty much any windows library call network code does on other threads may block.\nAnd it is a safe bet that other code may be slow as well.\n\nI would expect that any task posted to a MayBlock() task runner is understood to be potentially very slow without the need to explicitly annotate the parts of it that are thought to be slow.\n\nThanks",
