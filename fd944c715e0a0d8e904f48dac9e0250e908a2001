      "message": "hmm, actually this doesn\u0027t hold\n\nI meant it to DCHECK that these things are not called after HostDestroyedOnUIThread, which is ok. However, it may not hold if renderer takes a while to get launched or something, so WaitAfterVSyncOnUIThread or SetFrameFutureOnUIThread can be called before BindFilterOnUIThread actually succeeds.\n\nI think we need separate bools for these two different things. And maybe rename BindFilterOnUIThread to TryBindFilterOnUIThread, and make it return a bool? Whatever makes sense I guess",

Because if you told something to draw and then destroy the thing doing the drawing you don\u0027t know when it is going to return.\n\nUhh, webview teardown here is actually async on the UI thread. Meaning the frame might actually still be used, even after Host is deleted on the UI thread.\n\nBut that\u0027s not the important point here. The important point is that this race can cause the renderer thread to be killed incorrectly, which is a way bigger deal than displaying an empty frame during teardown.",
