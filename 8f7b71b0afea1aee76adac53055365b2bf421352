This will break overscroll glow for example since the controls will pass along delta to the overscroll glow. That said, I don\u0027t know why doing this would fix the issue - could you investigate this? I suspect this might just be masking it...",

In the bottom controls case, the controls don\u0027t actually consume any delta because the page scrolls immediately (regardless of the offset of the controls).",

I\u0027ve seen plenty of these browser-control related jump bugs but they\u0027re always caused by clamping/anchoring which happens after the scroll ends and during the WebViewImpl::ResizeWithBrowserControls. i.e. Are you sure this test would have caught the bug?",
