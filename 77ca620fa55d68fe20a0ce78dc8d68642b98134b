In both cases, it ends up being set as a function of |old_state| and IsSuspended().\n\nas in, if |old_state| is STARTING, then we don\u0027t need |state|. \n |waiting_for_seek_| will be false, and |state| would be PLAYING.\n\notherwise, in the |state| \u003d\u003d PLAYING case, i don\u0027t see how we should ever be IsSuspended() when this callback arrives.  We won\u0027t reach @205 while a suspend is in progress (we\u0027d be in SUSPENDING rather than SUSPENDED in that case), and similarly for @237.\n\nso, IsSuspended \u003d\u003e |state_| \u003d\u003d STARTING or SUSPENDING, i think.  anything else would be bad.\n\ni didn\u0027t check |waiting_for_seek_| carefully, so maybe that one does require |state| to get right.\n\nall of this is with the caveat that i\u0027m not terribly familiar with the pipeline state machine.  so, maybe, i\u0027m just writing a pleasant story about how i imagine the pipeline works.  :)",
