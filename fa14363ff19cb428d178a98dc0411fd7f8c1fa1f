      "message": "I find it confusing that this method would have a different behavior if already in a RunLoop (as it blocks the underlying loop from making progress and it also doesn\u0027t wait).\n\nI guess it did before (the RunLoopUntilIdle below would, unintentionally, be a no-op when nested).\n\nI think we should allow nested runloops to run application tasks in tests. The side-effects are either finding re-entrancy bugs in tests (a good outcome), or it doesn\u0027t matter (a fine outcome that avoids devs wasting time).",
