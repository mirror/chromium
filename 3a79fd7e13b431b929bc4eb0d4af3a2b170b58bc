      "message": "the other concern I had is that new code is less tolerant of connectionSetup being called twice. connectionSetup is oneway/async, so if it\u0027s called twice, then this code could run on two threads in parallel.\n\nIt should not be called more than once, but verifying that is actually really difficult.. so I guess make that more clear in code, both in browser and renderer side, before making this change?",
