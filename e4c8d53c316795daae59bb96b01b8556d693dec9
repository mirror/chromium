      "message": "Could you put a check here as well that output size is as big as the largest paint op?\n\nAlso, I think the checks could just be dchecks.  I think in general most calling code is going to not pass in buffer for deserializing if it\u0027s too small anyway, so it\u0027s not a thing that will likely ever happen in practice.  Up to you either way, I don\u0027t feel too strongly.",
