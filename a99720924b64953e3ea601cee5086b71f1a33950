Creation of two databases attached to the same profile leads to the fact that sqlite file is accessed from two different sequences -\u003e race. It was okay before this change because all PredictorDatabases used the single DB thread.\n\nTestWithBrowserView class doesn\u0027t use predictor_db_ so it should be safe to delete it.",
