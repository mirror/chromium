E.g.: web+example://foo\u003dbar\u0026bar\u003dbaz would result in https://example.org/search?q\u003dweb+example://foo\u003dbar\u0026bar\u003dbaz . The latter would be treated as a request for path /search on example.com with query parameters q\u003dweb+example://foo\u003dbar and bar\u003dbaz. This seems wrong.",
