      "message": "In the example you\u0027ve used in the test, this would result in incorrect behavior, right? E.g.: web+example://foo\u003dbar\u0026bar\u003dbaz would result in https://example.org/search?q\u003dweb+example://foo\u003dbar\u0026bar\u003dbaz . The latter would be treated as a request for path /search on example.com with query parameters q\u003dweb+example://foo\u003dbar and bar\u003dbaz. This seems wrong.",

The default encode set [3], a.k.a. the path percent-encode set, includes the code points in the range U+0000 through U+001F inclusive, all code points greater than U+007E, U+0020 SPACE, U+0022 (\"), U+003C (\u003c), U+003E (\u003e), U+0060 (`), U+0023 (#), U+003F (?), U+007B ({), and U+007D (}).\n\nAssuming |url| above is already UTF-8 encoded, then net::EscapeExternalHandlerValue() gets you almost all the way there except that the (?) and (#) characters should also be escaped.
