      "message": "Yes, we\u0027ve discussed this with Hajime-san offline. I have something like this in mind (e.g. for InternalLoading):\n\n\"This task type should be used for implementation details of loading process, for example notifying some component that loading has been finished.\nThis task type should not run any javascript, use kNetworking or another appropriate task source in this case.\nThis task type is typically used in //content/renderer/loader or //WebKit/Source/core/loader.\"",

      "message": "I\u0027m fine with writing more generic explanations, but I\u0027m not sure this helps developers to determine which task type should be used. For example, I intended to use kInternalLoading for tasks posted in //content/renderer/loader, and there are various tasks e.g. task runner used at shared_memory_data_consumer_handle.cc:139 should be kInternalTaskType, but it is hard to tell the task is actually related to loading (this seems just notifying clients when some data is added to the buffer).\n\nI assume that task type should be determined just based on where the task is posted, but this is just my opinion.",

      "message": "I think that matching every directory with associated task type is not quite what we want.\n\nThe spec part of task type describes the nature of the task and I believe that the non-spec part of TaskType should match this as well. However, in 90% of the cases the directory matches the nature of the task, so it\u0027s a very strong hint (almost all tasks from core/loader are loading-related). However, there might be directories and files without a strong associations (e.g. core/dom/Document.cpp posts some async tasks and it\u0027s rather hard to guess what they are from just filename).\n\nSo I believe that we need some descriptions of what these tasks to provide a guideline in non-obvious contexts.",
