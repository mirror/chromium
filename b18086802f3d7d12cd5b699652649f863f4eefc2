      "message": "This is really scary to me, even if it works.  Can we consider other options?\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is a bit of helper code in the color scheme:  An enum of colors (not all of them), and a corresponding switch-based getter, to look up color by ID.  Then you can just pass a color ID in here, and look it up in the current scheme when needed.  It\u0027d be a lot easier to grok.\n\nAlternatively, Text could take in a lambda that gets its color.  Could be either a constant, or, a color scheme lookup.",
