      "message": "This suggestion needs to be visited less recently for the ordering to work.\n(The decreased weight on typed visits causes implicitly a bit more comparative weight to recency.  Thus, this suggestion needs to be a little order for the tests to pass, otherwise it will outside shorter URLs like. www.teamliquid.net.  Both of these have 10+ typed visited visits, and this one is more recent.  I\u0027d rather it be slightly less recent to make the tests make sense and suggest the shorter one.)",
