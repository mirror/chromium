      "message": "Here are my guesses of what was/willbe happening, please correct me:\n1. it used to crash in native with std::set_new_handler(), this probably collects a crash dump\n2. here instead we exit the process (as usual, without running destructors), this won\u0027t capture any crash, neither in native nor in Java\n3. those crashes were probably not particularly useful because OOM situations would lead to a wide variety of stacks to be reported\n\nAlso digit@ explained today that all CHECK(0)s here would be eliminated by the compiler. Though if we wanted we could dereference some extern and it would work for non-LTO compilers at least? Do we want such much? I can entirely be wrong here.",

      "message": "Just to be clear, this only affects the crazy linker itself (these symbols are not exported by the linker, and not used by the libraries that it loads).\n\nIt is true that by default operator new(size_t) cannot return nullptr, and that the compiler will explicitly remove null checks after new calls, as in:\n\n  Foo* foo \u003d new Foo(10);\n  if (!foo) {                \u003c--- this branch is removed by an optimizing compiler!!\n     // Handle memory error.\n  }\n\nThere is also \"operator new(size_t, const std::nothrow_t\u0026)\" which can return nullptr, but must be called explicitly, with \"new (std::nothrow) T\" instead of \"new T\", so nobody does it, and this does not apply to the linker.\n\nNOTE: If I add a \"return nullptr\" at the end of this function, the compiler will error with a message saying that operator new(size_t) *cannot* return nullptr :-) It compiles the following code as-is without error, even though the function doesn\u0027t end with a return.\n\nI will add a comment about this, since this is subtle :)",

      "message": "Naive questions continued (sorry, David:)\n\nIs it possible to crash here instead of returning nullptr or exiting? Would these crashes be helpful? I think even though their stack traces will contain unrelated \u0027garbage\u0027, the amount of OOM crashes is a nice metric for release management. I thought we used to crash on OOM before this change and would stop doing so after the change. I thought it is an issue, but could be missing something.\n\nAnother question: are you planning to do the same for the Chrome DSO or it would require custom modifications in libc++ which you want to avoid?",
