      "message": "Here are my guesses of what was/willbe happening, please correct me:\n1. it used to crash in native with std::set_new_handler(), this probably collects a crash dump\n2. here instead we exit the process (as usual, without running destructors), this won\u0027t capture any crash, neither in native nor in Java\n3. those crashes were probably not particularly useful because OOM situations would lead to a wide variety of stacks to be reported\n\nAlso digit@ explained today that all CHECK(0)s here would be eliminated by the compiler. Though if we wanted we could dereference some extern and it would work for non-LTO compilers at least? Do we want such much? I can entirely be wrong here.",
