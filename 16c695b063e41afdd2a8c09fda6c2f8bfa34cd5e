      "message": "As with the other CL, I think this API of returning the same pointer as is passed as an argument is a bit confusing. Since StartupData is only struct with two values, how about just returning one by value from this function (and using that value to initialize a StartupData in the caller). This should be pretty much as efficient as what\u0027s here once the compiler optimizes it. WDYT?",
