      "message": "The reason I have \"global\" here is that I don\u0027t want to pass this huge symbols around in multiprocess pool. I think when you call pool.map(func, args), python will create a copy of args and slows it down. Correct me if I am wrong though. Creating copy of big symbols object defeats the purpose of speeding it up. I tried to pass symbols to pool.map on line 614 and it takes more time to resolve symbols.",
