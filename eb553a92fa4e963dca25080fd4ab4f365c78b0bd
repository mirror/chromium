      "message": "the screenshot you posted doesn\u0027t seem correct relative to the mock --- the size doesn\u0027t line up. I think you might want the size to be 16 (the mock says 13.3 but doesn\u0027t account for internal padding).\n\nAlso, I wonder why we aren\u0027t using kInfoOutlineIcon which is pretty much the same idea and used elsewhere in the UI. Did designers intentionally diverge from that precedent?",
