Looking at the commits, I see 2-3 occasional commits within a few minutes from each other at peak hours (~18:00 and ~23:00 UTC). \n\nios-simulator-cronet can take ~20 min if it needs compiling (e.g. https://build.chromium.org/p/tryserver.chromium.mac/builders/ios-simulator-cronet/builds/337), but otherwise it\u0027s pretty fast to bail out with analyze (2-3 min).\n\nTogether, these numbers suggest that 2 machines should handle this builder if it\u0027s triggered only by only \u0027ios\u0027 changes, however it will likely need more machines to be on the general CQ pool, as chromium gets ~60 CLs per hour at peak hours, and even at 3 min. average run it would take 3-4 bots to handle the load.\n\nSo, my previous suggestion of adding it to CQ as a general builder would NOT work yet, but after adding 2-3 more machines to the pool it\u0027d be my preferred way to do so. I\u0027d suggest to file a quick crbug and add a TODO here to promote this to a proper CQ bot.",
