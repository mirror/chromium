      "message": "This doesn\u0027t feel very right... The command buffer logic is at a higher level than ui/gl, so this is a conceptual layering violation. Furthermore, I worry about the hidden dependencies - does this mean the passthrough decoder makes some assumptions about EGL_DISPLAY_ROBUST_RESOURCE_INITIALIZATION_ANGLE, do we have a way to test that it\u0027s correctly enabled with it?\n\nI realize that there may not be a good way of parametrizing the EGL initialization beyond command-line flags today (which is kinda problematic in test environments)... I guess 2 questions:\n1- is there a downside in always enabling it?\n2- could we enable it on a per-context basis, so that we can request the extension at context creation (via context creation parameters)?\n\n\nOther than that, maybe it would make sense to add an \"Options\" struct to gl::init::InitializeGLOneOff, so that the initialization code can request the right mode.",
