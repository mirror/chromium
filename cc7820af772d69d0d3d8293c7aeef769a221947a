      "message": "I seem to remember this code was used because the hit-testing in the window-server was not taking into account the expanded hit-test region for easy-resize targeter etc. We include that information in the HitTestRegionList we send from aura to viz. So once we use the HitTestQuery, we will already be taking into account the expanded hit-test region for easy-resize. That means, we don\u0027t need to find a window with a targeter here.",

      "message": "The server knows about easy resize targeter because of SetExtendedHitRegionForChildren ( https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/services/ui/public/interfaces/window_manager.mojom?q\u003dwindow_manager.mojom\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr\u0026l\u003d273 ). But you are right, there may be other targeters that won\u0027t be picked up correctly until hit testing lands. I\u0027m going to nuke this and go with https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/643948 . That makes it so that capture windows take priority (as they do in classic). Could you take a look at that one?",
