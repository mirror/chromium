Just put each of these questions in as a section below where you discuss the answer.\n\nThe current structuring makes the document seem more scary and discourages skimming.I think it\u0027s sufficient to just open with \"Memory use is much more complicated than malloc/free!\" and then go into why.",

There are subtleties expressed by these questions I think it\u0027s important for people trying to enter the memory space to understand.\n\nMaybe we could change the tone of lines 3-6 to make this seem less scary/discouraging? [I wasn\u0027t particularly scared or discouraged, but I\u0027m not the relevant audience]. brettw, wdyt?",
