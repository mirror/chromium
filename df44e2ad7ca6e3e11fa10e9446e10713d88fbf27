There are subtleties expressed by these questions I think it\u0027s important for people trying to enter the memory space to understand.\n\nMaybe we could change the tone of lines 3-6 to make this seem less scary/discouraging? [I wasn\u0027t particularly scared or discouraged, but I\u0027m not the relevant audience]. brettw, wdyt?",
