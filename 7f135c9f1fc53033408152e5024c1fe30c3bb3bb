      "message": "I don\u0027t think we should have done this change.  It\u0027s functionally equivalent to the old code for now, but it doesn\u0027t seem to make semantic sense to me.  Why is this code structured like it is?  Why is label_width below subtracting 2x all this stuff?  How do I know this shouldn\u0027t have been\n\n  label_width \u003d width() - back_button_width() - insets.width();\n\nWe\u0027ve moved from code that didn\u0027t allow non-symmetrical insets to code that allows but ignores them, which is kind of worse.",
