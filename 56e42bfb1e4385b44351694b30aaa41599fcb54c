      "message": "std::unique_ptr by default does not play nice with private destructors, which is why I made it public. It is possible to keep it private and use a custom deleter, but that requires quite a bit more work. Let me know what you think.\n\nNote: A private constructor does not work with std::make_unique either, but here we can use the base::WrapUnique workaround (see comments below and Note 1 here: https://www.chromium.org/developers/coding-style/cpp-dos-and-donts#TOC-Prefer-MakeUnique-to-WrapUnique)",
