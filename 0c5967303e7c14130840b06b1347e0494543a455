      "message": "The other things which call Next are not members of TaskQueue, which is the context in which this statement was intended. If I were to document (in the code) which functions/methods update is_active_, I would mention it in the documentation of TaskQueue::Next and TaskQueue::PauseCurrent, but not e.g. IntallableManager::WorkOnTask, so it didn\u0027t seem to be something I should mention in the commit message either (I\u0027m not actually going to document it for TaskQueue::Next or TaskQueue::PauseCurrent, because it seems like overkill). The commit message was intended to implicitly contrast Next and PauseCurrent with other methods of TaskQueue which don\u0027t yet update is_active_ (e.g. TaskQueue::Reset).  I\u0027ll update those other methods in other CLs.",
