Is it still useful to talk about the old way? Usually you talk about the way it\u0027s not done when it\u0027s not obvious why we don\u0027t do it that way.",

      "message": "I was thinking about it more and I think I\u0027m OK now with \"it used to be this way but we choose to do it this way now\".\n\nI\u0027m also rather lost by all of this. The call to SiteInstance::CreateForURL() creates a new BrowsingInstance anyway. Returning nullptr prevents the new WC from joining into the existing SiteInstance, but SiteInstance::CreateForURL() makes a new BrowsingInstance() which would also prevent that, right? The fact that this function never returns an actual existing SiteInstance baffles me.\n\nAt this point I\u0027m not sure that my comment is relevant at all.",
