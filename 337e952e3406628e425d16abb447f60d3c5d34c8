Is OS_CHROMEOS by itself enough?\n\nYeah - I think OS_CHROMEOS by itself is more correct. adding linux as well suggests something like ~doesn\u0027t happen on Fuscia, or ~doesn\u0027t happen on ChromeOS hardware, just the cross-compiled version (except neither of those are distinct things AFAIK)",

This is the way the condition was structured in https://crrev.com/58059.\n\nAh, looks like it started on ChromeOS and was then expanded to Linux as well, and the redundancy wasn\u0027t removed. But that was a long time ago.. I don\u0027t think the reasons for this test being disabled are related in any way to the recent interactive_ui_tests on Windows fixes (which are awesome btw :). IMO it would be fine to consider leaving this disabled for now..\n\nOtherwise, it\u0027s fine to have OS_CHROMEOS || OS_LINUX as you have. The redundancy at least makes it clear that it\u0027s intentional to disable on ChromeOS as well as desktop-linux.",
