      "message": "\u003e IIRC gpu.mojom is only used from renderer [1], and currently\n\u003e JDAs are only created from the Browser process [2].\n\nNote that with mus, the browser process does not have access to mojom.GpuService. It only has access to mojom.Gpu.\n\nI am making changes so that browser has only access to mojom.Gpu in non-mus config too (wip CL: https://codereview.chromium.org/2967573002/ There will be a small part in browser that will have access to mojom.GpuService too, but that will not be accessible to other parts of the browser). So even if we want to restrict the access to browser, I think it makes sense to do that with mojom.Gpu.\n\n\u003e Hence\n\u003e the only place where we need to add a factory method is \n\u003e GpuProcessHost - gpu_service.mojom - GpuService (and we can\n\u003e find GpuProcessHost a la [3]).
