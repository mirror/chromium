      "message": "IIRC gpu.mojom is only used from renderer [1], and currently\nJDAs are only created from the Browser process [2]. Hence\nthe only place where we need to add a factory method is \nGpuProcessHost - gpu_service.mojom - GpuService (and we can\nfind GpuProcessHost a la [3]).  Correct?\n\n(I think that when mojifying interfaces is better to leave\nthe current dialogues as unchanged as possible -- so, although\nwe might think it\u0027s interesting to make JDAs available to\nrenderer(s), all that should happen in other CLs).\n\n[1] see the diagram in https://goo.gl/HkwYvA\n[2] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/renderer_host/media/in_process_video_capture_device_launcher.cc?dr\u003dC\u0026l\u003d159\n[3] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/renderer_host/media/video_capture_gpu_jpeg_decoder.cc?dr\u003dCSs\u0026l\u003d227",
