      "message": "Why not? If it\u0027s to prevent the use of exceptions in the STL, this macro doesn\u0027t affect whether libc++ uses exceptions, as I wrote in the comment. If it\u0027s to prevent the use of exceptions in other code, that code shouldn\u0027t be using _HAS_EXCEPTIONS (which is MSVC STL specific) but rather _CPPUNWIND (which is a compiler-predefined macro which is defined by cl and clang-cl if /EHsc is passed), and I am sending out CLs to change that code to use _CPPUNWIND instead.",
