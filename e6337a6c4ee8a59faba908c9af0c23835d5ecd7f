      "message": "The service_manager establishes connections between services. So when, say ui::Service::BindWindowTreeFactoryRequest() is called, it is passed a service_manager::BindSourceInfo object, which contains the service_manager::Identity, which contains a name. This name comes from the service manager, not the service which is making the call.\n\nSo mus is getting the string \u0027content_browser\u0027 from the service manager, which it then passes on to the window manager on new WindowTree creation. I think this is safe since the string comes from the service_manager, and then it\u0027s safe for the window manager to trust data coming from mus since both are privileged processes and the WM already trusts the data coming from mus.",
