autoscroll.html
---------------
This test has been forked because of changed behavior in text drag
delay for Windows.  This original test doesn't initiate a drag, but
the new behavior causes it to.  This forked copy of the test has
been changed to not select any text (so there's no drag).

tabindex-focus-blur-all.html
----------------------------
Pulled in from a later revision of WebKit than the 3.1 branch.
Had to modify the third frame on the page to point to an HTML
file as this test violated our cross-domain security around
data urls. Added resources/tabindex-focus-blur-all-frame3.html
in addition to the webkit version of this file to accomodate.
