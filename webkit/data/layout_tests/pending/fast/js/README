resources/function-toString-parentheses.js
------------------------------------------
Expected result has the wrong parentheses for testHigherFirst case with parens
around the first condition and removesExtraParentheses == false.  Safari (and
Firefox) has removesExtraParentheses == true, so the problem never turned
up there.  Our results may still be wrong, though: see bug 1135116.

The main .html file, and the other files in resources/, are unchanged from
the originals but here to support this forked test.

resources/const.js
------------------------------------------
Test failed because of a const/const redeclaration error being thrown.  Changed
the second const declaration of x to z to avoid this error.

A bug should be filed upstream for this test post-beta.
