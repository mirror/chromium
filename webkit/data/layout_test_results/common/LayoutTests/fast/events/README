This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

autoscroll-expected.txt
-----------------------
This test has been forked because of changed behavior in text drag delay for
windows.  This test doesn't initiate a drag, but the new behavior causes
it to.  The updated test that doesn't cause a drag is in
webkit/data/layout_tests/pending/.

frame-click-focus-expected.txt
------------------------------
In Chrome, as in Firefox and IE, we trigger a main frame focus event when the
page finishes loading (before any user action).  Safari doesn't.

drag-in-frames-expected.txt
---------------------------
Due to the way we fake events in EventSendingController, we can't match
exactly the order of drag & drop events.  Two of the events are swapped
when running this test automatically, but they work properly when
running doing a real drag & drop in the test shell.
