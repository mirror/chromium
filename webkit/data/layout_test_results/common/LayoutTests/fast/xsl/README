This file documents why the various tests have been rebaselined.

xslt-extra-content-at-end.xml
-----------------------------
We behave the same as Safari in this test, except that our error message
refers to a different column number.  Neither their column number nor ours
makes a lot of sense, since the XSL transformation moves things around, but
ours is no worse than theirs.

mozilla-tests.xml
-----------------
The Safari expected result includes an error message that does not appear to
be correct, judging from the test's own description of what should be in the
output.  Our result doesn't produce the error.
