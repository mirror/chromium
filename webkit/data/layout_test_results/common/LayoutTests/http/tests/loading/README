  We differ from DumpRenderTree in how we handle URLs with invalid schemes.
They ignore such requests early, at the policy delegate, and ask the shell
to handle it.  We first try to load the request, then generate an error.
This difference shows up in extra load events for us, which is why we have
different expected output.
