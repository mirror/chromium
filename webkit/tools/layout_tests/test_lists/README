The files in this directory are read by the
run_webkit_tests.py script and used to determine which tests to run
and which failures to consider regressions.

If we *never* expect to pass these tests (e.g. test for Apple's objective-c 
API), then add them to tests_ignore.txt. If we expect that we might ever want to
pass the test, first file a bug, then add it to tests_fixable.txt. 

Tests can have the following metatdata associated with them (optional):
DEFER : We don't expect to pass them in the current release.
SKIP : We don't want to run them (perhaps because they take too long).

Tests have a build-type (required):
V8 # The test only fails in V8 build.
KJS # The test only fails in KJS build.

Tests can also have expections (required):
PASS
FAIL
TIMEOUT
CRASH

The format of a test is as follows:
BUILD_TYPE # METADATA : TEST = EXPECTATIONS

For example
V8 # DEFER : LayoutTests/media = PASS | FAIL

The above means that in the V8 build, all the media tests are flaky and
we'll defer fixing them for a future release.

Note that tests_fixable.txt and tests_ignored.txt aren't allowed to share any
lines. Except for skipped tests, all tests are run. In calculating success
metrics, we ignore tests in tests_ignored.txt and deferred tests.
