This directory is for forked files from WebKit that contain changes that have
not yet been accepted upstream. Everything here should be eventually accepted
upstream, or it should go in the glue or port directory.

To fork/unfork a file, see trunk/third_party/WebKit/README for steps.

If you fork a file, put the same changes in a patch you post on bugs.webkit.org.
See http://wiki.corp.google.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ChromeWebKitPatches
for more information on how to do this.

It is your responsibility to make sure your patch doesn't live here forever.
If the WebKit folks don't like it, you need to work out an acceptable solution
with them.  We can't permanently fork cross-platform code into pending/.
