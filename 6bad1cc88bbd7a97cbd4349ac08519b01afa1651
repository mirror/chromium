      "message": "I was wondering if this assumption in the file format was going to bite us. I think this is something we\u0027ll need to allow for more cleanly going forward. \n\nGenerally speaking, I agree that two bots with the same name on different waterfalls should try to run the same thing, but I can imagine cases where we\u0027ll want to have \"CI-only\" tests or \"tryjob-only\" tests; I\u0027ve wanted this in the past for the chromium recipe, and have had to use workarounds instead.",

      "message": "This area certainly needs more thought. There\u0027s another ongoing project to make the bots\u0027 names on the waterfalls unique, which will somewhat solve this problem.\n\nThe situation where some gtests have the same name as instrumentation tests and some bots run one but not the other should, IMO, be resolved by running the same bunch of test suites everywhere. (This only came up on chromium.android.fyi.)\n\nFinally, regarding CI-only vs. trybot-only tests: I think the trybots\u0027 mirroring of waterfall bots works pretty well to ensure that test configurations remain consistent. In the long run I think that having separate bots to run tests which shouldn\u0027t run on the trybots can work, and would leave this configuration parameter out of this script and its config files.",
