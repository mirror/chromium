      "message": "Do we want to pass the entire bundle (i.e., factories from browser side + {blob, direct network loader factory} from renderer_blink_platform_impl) in this case? How about the worker case at line 3535?\n\nIt seems the correct behavior is to pass the entire bundle (as opposed to only passing factories from renderer_blink_platform_impl). Is my understanding correct?\n\nThis causes some test failures because this may end up cloning some URLLoaderFactory interfaces that are backed by URLLoaderInterceptor::Interceptor at the browser side. URLLoaderInterceptor::Interceptor doesn\u0027t support cloning for now. It shouldn\u0027t be hard to fix the interceptor. But I would like to make sure I understand the behavior correctly before making the fix.",
