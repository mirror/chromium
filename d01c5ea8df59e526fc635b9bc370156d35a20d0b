CredentialRequestOptions and CredentialCreationOptions  are very simple dictionaries without any methods, which should be created by the user and passed as arguments to get() and create(), so I thought typedef should suffice.\n\nPlease verify the typedefs I made in next patch set (I wasn\u0027t sure about how to typedef a dictionary without any fields, which is CredentialCreationOptions) and also let me know if I should still stick with one way for defining all types.",
