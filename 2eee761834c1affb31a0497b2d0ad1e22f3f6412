Or IDR_PROFILES_TURN_ON_SYNC_ILLUSTRATION\n\nThis allows it to sort next to related things more easily.\n\nNote this line number is actually correct for IDR_SY* whereas the IDR_TU* or ISD_PROFILES* should go elsewhere in the file. (ignore the IDR_CLOSE stuff below -- it was probably IDR_TAB_CLOSE at some point and got renamed).",

      "message": "sending a negative to BoxLayout for |between_child_spacing| feels chancy.. it was never intended to take a negative value. If you intend to rely on this, you should add a simple test to box_layout_unittest.cc . Otherwise, you could do a manual layout. I think after this change you have a nesting of LayoutManagers 5 layers deep which is starting to put stress on the layout system, and will make it very hard to diagnose layout issues in future. So a manual layout of the three views here would be OK in my opinion.",

      "message": "this multi-line label may trigger the same layout woes I was diagnosing in http://crbug.com/789118 . More reason to use a manual layout. You could also set an explicit width to the multiline label to provide a hint to the layout system similar to what I did in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/799614 . There\u0027s a deeper issue why the layout system is confounded by this, but I haven\u0027t had time to look -- profile menu seems to be the only thing triggering it right now. You may need to keep an eye on the performance and address this in future.",
