I thought flexbox used items\u0027 min/max preferred width as input to to the flex algorithm, and used the output of the algorithm to set override sizes on the items before telling the items to layout.\n\nMy understanding is most likely wrong, because if it were correct then this CL would make flex item tables report incorrect widths to the parent flexbox.\n\nWhere did I go wrong?",

      "message": "Tables in a regular *block* formatting context are special, in that they use the min/max preferred widths of the table to calculate the table width, even if table width is fixed, percentage, auto, or anything at all, really. This must not happen if the table is a flex (or grid) item. Then the flex/grid algorithm gets to decide. As far as I know (but my memory is rusty and I also don\u0027t know everything), the min/max width of such a table should never affect the flex/grid item size, unless the flex/grid container itself is intrinsically sized (e.g. floated with auto width, or width:fit-content, etc.).\n\nOr?",

In most of the table traces I\u0027ve looked at, the first call to MaxPreferredLogicalWidth is usually via this method (called on line 328 below).\n\nI suppose you\u0027re saying that flexbox retrieves the min/max preferred widths before calling UpdateLayout on its items, which makes sense, I just can\u0027t find where it\u0027s happening in codesearch.",
