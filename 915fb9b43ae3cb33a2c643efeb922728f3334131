Following the trail from the JS code to the C++ implementation is hard enough without making the next developer that comes along try to search for \"sensor\" :) \n\nWe made this property [nodoc] because it\u0027s only used by Settings; we can rename this any time we want since it is undocumented / not for external use.",
