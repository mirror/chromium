      "message": "so, in this reland, rather than reverting back to pass \"event\" to ::ConvertEventLocationToTargetWindowLocation and do an implicit cast (which is what was done before), the CL adds an extra safety check in DesktopWindowTreeHostX11::DispatchEvent, to ensure we bail out earlier when event type is UNKNOWN.\n\n@sadrul, is this approach Ok with you or would you prefer keep the previous implicit cast when calling ::ConvertEventLocationToTargetWindowLocation and remove the safety if-check?\n\nAlso, as I understand it, it is hard to provide a unit test to this case (as explained in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/853953/6#message-76811f30001b1d6100728c7ce5c4b25c00a5be5c), so maybe we can add\n\na) a TODO(msisov): try to add a test that covers this scenario. See \u003clink to explanation\u003e.\n\nb) an extra comment explaining why the if-check is needed.\n\n.. and move on with reviews?",
