      "message": "I think it\u0027s intuitive that properties that are not enabled won\u0027t be affected by the \u0027all\u0027 property, they won\u0027t be affected by anything right? I wouldn\u0027t include that info here as I think it\u0027s an implementation detail. After the first sentence I would just say \"Descriptors (is_property: false) are never affected by changes to the \u0027all\u0027 property\" or similar",

It might be possible to add them to CSSProperties.json, but it will take some work and will need to be done separately. IMHO it\u0027s not worth it.",
