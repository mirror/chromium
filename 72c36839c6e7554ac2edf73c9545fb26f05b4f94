      "message": "It seems that the touch emulator doesn\u0027t respect the `preventDefault` on the page so it will cause zooming. Previously this didn\u0027t cause a zoom because it was the first move (if there was a second move, it would zoom). I\u0027ve changed the moves here to be smaller than the touch slop so we don\u0027t initiate a zoom.\n\nDo you know who owns the touch emulator? This feels like a bug but who to file it with?",
