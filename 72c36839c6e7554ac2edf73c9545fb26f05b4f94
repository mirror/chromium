      "message": "It seems that the touch emulator doesn\u0027t respect the `preventDefault` on the page so it will cause zooming. Previously this didn\u0027t cause a zoom because it was the first move (if there was a second move, it would zoom). I\u0027ve changed the moves here to be smaller than the touch slop so we don\u0027t initiate a zoom.\n\nDo you know who owns the touch emulator? This feels like a bug but who to file it with?",

      "message": "I tried removing this and others but found out it\u0027s tricky...span isn\u0027t always computable like this. e.g., in the if block above, it\u0027s no longer the case. Similarly for prev_span_ because of the adjustment we do now. The only one is initial_span but I\u0027ve removed the x/y versions in the newer patch and removed the slop fix for the x/y versions.\n\nI removed it for x/y because it\u0027s not really consistent - If we scale along only a single axis, say y, we\u0027ll actually have a non-sensical prev_span_x and curr_span_x. I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s a right way to handle the components in a consistent way so I\u0027d rather not change them at all.\n\nI made the change originally because gesture_provider.cc computes its own scale based on span_y and it needs to be consistent with the total span because it uses GetScaleFactor(). I\u0027ve now just adjusted that code to make a similar adjustment at the call site, wdyt?",
