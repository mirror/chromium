      "message": "Based on a discussion with jamescook@, we favored BindingSet\u003c\u003e over Binding\u003c\u003e eventhough we have a single client at the moment. The reason is that the client stays bound, but it\u0027s possible for some other random piece of code in chrome to temporarily bind the interface, call a method, and release the binding. If we use Binding\u003c\u003e that doesn\u0027t work, since there is only one Binding.",

      "message": "It just seems odd to have an interface that expects a 1:1 relationship with a client interface, but also expects random components to call into it. I would expect one or the other. If it\u0027s logically 1:1, then please use Binding. If it\u0027s meant to support multiple clients, then SetClient should be AddClient.\n\nIt\u0027s useful to be as precise as possible when defining these things:, since Mojo adds a considerable amount of abstraction that can make it harder how to understand how different components are related.\n\nSpeaking of this... is there any high level documentation for how ash expects to interact with other parts of the system going forward?",
