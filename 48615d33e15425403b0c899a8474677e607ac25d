Rather than being Harmonized, it will move straight to mocks for `DICE` - http://go/ydezy (internal), and http://crbug.com/716052 [there should probably be a \"UI\" bug that cbrug/716052 is blocked on at some point, but I couldn\u0027t find one].\n\nthe drive link is fine.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know the original context, so this might be a lie, but I think it was set so that if there was a tooltip, it would show when hovering over anywhere on the entire button and not only when only hovering over the label. Except I don\u0027t think any tooltip was actually set - only the accessible name (and this is true for the old code and this patchset). It looks like |Button| sets the accessible name from the tooltip text, and not the other way around.\n\nI fixed this by using |label()| or |title_| tooltips when there is no |subtitle_|, and setting our own tooltip when both |title_| and |subtitle_| exist, hopefully that\u0027s better. I checked and hovering over anywhere on the button shows a tooltip when strings are too long. Do you think this needs a test?\n\nI also moved this particular line back to the third constructor because we\u0027re using label() as a tooltip handler again (sometimes).\n\nThanks for poking at this :)",
