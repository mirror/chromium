      "message": "I think this is safe, but at best it\u0027s a minor optimization and the more I look at ExtensionService, the less comfortable I feel making changes like this. My concern is if there\u0027s some way for an unloaded extension to be reloaded when it\u0027s not in the terminated or disabled sets. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s possible but there\u0027s a lot of entry points to these functions from other parts of Chrome so I\u0027m not confident enough.",
