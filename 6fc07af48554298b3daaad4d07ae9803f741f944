      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that the inline text box index is that stable either.\n\nImagine that a web page is completely static, but while the user\nis reading, they resize the browser window. That will completely\nchange the inline text boxes as the paragraph shapes changes and\nlines wrap in different ways, but the static text nodes will be\ncompletely stable.\n\nI think the best thing to store is just the character index into the\nstatic text node. It\u0027s easy to iterate over the inline text boxes to\nfind the one corresponding to a given character index.",

      "message": "If the inline text boxes change indices, it seems like  we shouldn\u0027t have a NodeGroupItem for each inlineTextBox at all, rather there should be one reference to the whole staticText, with a start/stop char. Then we can dynamically find the inlineTextBoxes inside that node as speech proceeds. Otherwise I think it\u0027d be possible to skip inlineTextBoxes \n\nThat\u0027s a more significant change that\u0027s going to involve updating the way nodes are added to the queue to be read, as well as bigger updates to the way these are constructed.\n\nI think this is a dramatic improvement, but we should go all the way to that solution above later, because like you say, it\u0027s critical for resizing windows. What do you think?",
