But, in the new form of the test I\u0027m presuming it\u0027s omitted because HID is enough to verify that blocklist is working?\n\nI think this was attempting to test that a dynamically added blocklist item would also be blocked correctly. Other browsers may not support dynamic blocklists -- so perhaps we shouldn\u0027t add that concept to the testing API. But, if you think it likely they all would then it would be nice to keep. Otherwise we loose a bit of testing coverage, though we do have unit test coverage for dynamically adding.",
