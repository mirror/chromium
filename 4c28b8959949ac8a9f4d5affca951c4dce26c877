      "message": "Seems like we only append to it and never read back? Did you want to use then in IsCloseTo()? I think the current IsCloseTo() is good enough in terms of speed, but if you want to speed it up by using self._timestamps, I would be happy to approve it too. The least preferable is to keep it unused :) If you need it _timestamps a subsequent change, please introduce it there, it would make that change easier to read I think.",

      "message": "nit: we do not need to use \u0027cls\u0027 here, so it seems a @staticmethod would work the same way on the callsite, and would be conceptually .1% simpler. Now I checked the sources and see that @classmethod is more common. Wow. After that I am cannot ask for any change, but if you have a rule when to prefer one of the two over another, plz let me know so that I can be more consistent with your way.",
