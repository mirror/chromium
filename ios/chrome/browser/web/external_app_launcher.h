// page within a short time frame. In that case, user will be prompted with an
// option to block the application from launching.
// Then the method also checks for user interaction and for schemes that require
// special handling (eg. facetime, mailto) and may present the user with a
// confirmation dialog to open the application.
// Always calls |completionHandler|, which must not be nil, on the main thread
// with status of whether an app was launched for opening |gURL|.
