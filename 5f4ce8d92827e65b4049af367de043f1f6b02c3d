      "message": "This condition is not tested anymore in the new code, meaning vaapi support will be enabled regardless of the values of options.accelerated_video_encode_enabled and options.accelerated_video_decode_enabled. Previously the fact that the libraries have not been dlopened would make libva and vaapi_wrapper fail at init time. Now this is not the case anymore. Could you find a way to properly handle these flags again?",
