The favicon URL is something like chrome://favicon/\u003c|url| param here\u003e, and it\u0027s purely a guess here as to whether the site was accessed over HTTP or HTTPS in the backend favicon database.\n\nSite Details and other things with SiteSettingsBehaviour use HTTP currently, and I\u0027d say that HTTP is still the right guess the majority of the time (majority of traffic is over HTTPS but I think the majority of sites is still HTTP).",
