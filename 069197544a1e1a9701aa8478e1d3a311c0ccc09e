      "message": "These are replaced with [Extension|Arc]AppWindowLauncherItemController instances when launched. I believe the point of GetRunningApplications on this class is to instantiate one of these delegates to see if any instances of the app are running:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/ui/ash/launcher/chrome_launcher_controller.cc?rcl\u003d269c8ebdce06f2df62be0cec2cd2820ef4183e80\u0026l\u003d419\n\nI agree that neither is straightforward; I dislike the item delegate pattern, not to mention the practice of swapping delegates at various times. That said, I believe this comment is fairly accurate, and should be clarified/corrected, but probably not reduced to the suggestion on the right.",
