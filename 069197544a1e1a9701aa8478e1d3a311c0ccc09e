      "message": "\u003e These are replaced with [Extension|Arc]AppWindowLauncherItemController instances when launched.\n\nMaybe, but not in the case of a v1 packaged app. In this repro case, only this class, AppShortcutLauncherItemController, is instantiated. Perhaps that\u0027s the cause of this bug, that we\u0027re using it for a running app but shouldn\u0027t be?\n\nI\u0027ve verified that the AppShortcutLauncherItemController::Close() is the function being executed. And that makes sense -- that\u0027s the function that calls GetV1ApplicationsFromAppId().\n\nNotably, AppWindowLauncherItemController::Close() does *not* run, again at least in this v1 packaged app case. (That\u0027s what would run when calling Close() on an instance of the Extension* subclass.) In fact, in my repro steps AppWindowLauncherItemController\u0027s constructor never runs.\n\nBTW, it\u0027s also worth noting that this class and ChromeLauncherController\u0027s tests are referring to *hosted* apps as v1 apps. Hosted apps and v1 packaged apps aren\u0027t quite the same. https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/extensions/docs/extension_and_app_types.md#Hosted-app",
