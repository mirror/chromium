      "message": "I think this is about how navigator.serviceWorker.ready only resolves when the calling document is inside the scope of an active service worker. So if you\u0027re calling from \"test/data/doc.html\" and the service worker\u0027s scope is \"test/data/foo\" the promise won\u0027t resolve.\n\nThere are some ways to get around it. One possibility is making the test document/iframe in \"test/data/foo\". Another is doing something like:\n\nregister().then(reg \u003d\u003e {\n  return new Promise(resolve \u003d\u003e {\n    let worker \u003d reg.installing;\n    worker.addEventListener(\u0027statechange\u0027, e \u003d\u003e {\n      if (worker.state \u003d\u003d \u0027active\u0027)\n        resolve();\n    });\n  });\n});\n\n(That assumes you know reg.active doesn\u0027t already exist, ie it\u0027s a new registration.)",

      "message": "Yes, the issue is that service workers that don\u0027t match the scope of the file do not trigger navigator.serviceWorker.ready.\nI moved site_data.html and empty_worker.js to test/data/browsing_data, so they are not in the top level directory anymore.\nThanks for the suggested code but I think it is better to have an additional empty file than to use a complex workaround?",
