But I guess we do the same thing for top-level non-secure images that are dynamically-removed without a cross-page navigation.",

      "message": "We intentionally chose for HTTP-bad password warnings to behave differently than mixed content (in that the latter is sticky for the lifetime of the page, and the former disappears dynamically), though I can\u0027t say I really remember why we chose to do it that way. Maybe because HTTP-bad is scarier and we thought it would be more confusing/noticeable for it to appear with a login form but not disappear when the login form disappears.\n\nThat said, I think we should be moving away from dynamically-disappearing indicators; IMO, once a page gets downgraded, it should stay downgraded, for simplicity. The HTTP-bad passwords behavior is temporary -- in fact, I think we should even consider cutting the dynamic-removal behavior with Phase 2. It would simplify the code a lot.",
