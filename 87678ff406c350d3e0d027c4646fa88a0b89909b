      "message": "The unit test case you added convinces me (as a reader) that AddRef and Release are both called once, which is good.\n\nHowever, the part that I am still not convinced about (without having to go read the implementation of base::RefCountedThreadSafe\u003c\u003e) is whether or not |photo_callback| actually gets destroyed at the end or if it leaks. That is because I don\u0027t know if the |photo_callback| created by build() comes with a refcount of 0 or 1. If it comes out with 1, it would leak.\n\nHaving a refcounted object wrapped in a std::unique_ptr\u003c\u003e seems like a confusing and dangerous mix of lifetime management patterns. I guess the reason why refcounted classes typically get a private destructor in Chromium is to explicitly prevent this kind of usage. Unless you can find a better solution, I recommend having build() return a scoped_refptr\u003c\u003e instead of a std::unique_ptr\u003c\u003e. This would indicate to the reader that the returned instance is expected to come out with a refcount of 1, and then it should become clear what to do with it.",
