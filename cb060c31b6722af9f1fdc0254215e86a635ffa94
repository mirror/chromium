I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a magic scenario in which postMessage still needs work after a browser-initiated, cross-process, app-to-non-app navigation, so I\u0027m changing that expectation.  Renderer-initiated app-to-non-app navigation should keep postMessage working though, so I\u0027m now checking that too.  The test was introduced in https://codereview.chromium.org/86973002.",
