      "message": "I think so.  The new code should mostly mimic the else branch here - |tab_strip_model()-\u003eAddWebContents(...)| is also called in case of NEW_FOREGROUND_TAB toward the end of chrome::Navigate.  OTOH, I am not really sure\n\n1) why the code below special-cases CanSupportWindowFeature(FEATURE_TABSTRIP).\n2) why explicit calls to SetBounds and Show are needed.\n\nDo you think we can ask somebody else to take a look here?  FWIW, it seems to work fine.",

It seems to me that the code here copied the behavior of Browser::DuplicateContentsAt in https://codereview.chromium.org/5716003/patch/16001/17008, but that the copying was mostly accidental / was not core to the changes being made to support HTTP POST.\n\nI think the new behavior (opening a view-source of a popup in an existing rather than new tabbed browser) is okay from UX perspective.  This is based on 1) the note that this was the behavior long time ago [and changing this behavior seems accidental] and 2) the behavior seemed okay when I tried it manually at http://www.popuptest.com/goodpopups.html",
