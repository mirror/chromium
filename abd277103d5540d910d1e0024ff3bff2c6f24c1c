      "message": "Umm, yeah, that\u0027s totally redundant. Removed.\n\nWRT the meaning of the flags\n * kHighDynamicRange will will be \"turn on if HDR is detected\"\n * --force-color-profile\u003dscrgb-linear will \"always force HDR mode\"\n\nAfter this patch, there are only 2 places where we check kHighDynamicRange, namely\n * media::IsColorSpaceSupported, which becomes redundant when we enable\n   kVideoColorManagement unconditionally\n * media::DXVAVideoDecodeAccelerator, which will need some work",
