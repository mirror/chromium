      "message": "Umm, yeah, that\u0027s totally redundant. Removed.\n\nWRT the meaning of the flags\n * kHighDynamicRange will will be \"turn on if HDR is detected\"\n * --force-color-profile\u003dscrgb-linear will \"always force HDR mode\"\n\nAfter this patch, there are only 2 places where we check kHighDynamicRange, namely\n * media::IsColorSpaceSupported, which becomes redundant when we enable\n   kVideoColorManagement unconditionally\n * media::DXVAVideoDecodeAccelerator, which will need some work",

      "message": "This patch shouldn\u0027t be changing any behaviors -- kHighDynamicRange still controls whether or not we have HDR mode enabled.\n\nI agree about the end state of \"have 1 flag which specifies if we\u0027re auto-detecting HDR on Windows\". Until we kill of those 2 instances that need fixing, I think we should stick with just using kHighDynamicRange for that. Once those 2 instances are gone, we can rename it to kDetectWindowsHDR or something like that (and enable it by default!).",
