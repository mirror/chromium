      "message": "A few things:\n1- some tests have a null RenderThreadImpl (they have a mock instead). A null check would suffice I think.\n2- GetGpuFactories() will force instantiating the factories, even for renderers that don\u0027t use media. It seems like unnecessary overhead in the general case (both memory and startup time). Maybe we could separate a \"GetGpuFactories\" (gets if exists) from a \"CreateOrGetGpuFactories\" (creates if it doesn\u0027t exist), but we\u0027d still have to be careful to set the HDRRenderingStatus when calling the later (from other places).\n3- so, we could have different RenderWidgets in the same process (same RTI so same GpuVideoAcceleratorFactoriesImpl) that go on different screens (e.g. 2 windows with same origin open). Is this a problem?",
