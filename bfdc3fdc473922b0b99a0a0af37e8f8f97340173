      "message": "It\u0027s a bit messy. Closer investigation shows that crosscall_params.h includes windows.h (and that is probably unavoidable). I could move the #undef there. In general the #undef game isn\u0027t scientific or complete, it\u0027s whack-a-mole. My attempts at making it sane and sensible failed and a few ad-hoc undefs seem unavoidable for those bits of code that cannot tolerate the Microsoft macros.\n\nThe case for leaving the undef here is simple: MemoryBarrier is defined in thousands of source files and this is one of the few where it causes a problem.",
