      "message": "My understanding is it applies to both .h and .cc. But if the .h file includes it, then the .cc and unittest.cc files do not need to include it. Because I\u0027m adding #incldue \u003cvector\u003e to the .h file, I\u0027m dropping from the .cc file.\n\nSorry for the churn, it\u0027s kind of bizarre that I modified the unittest.cc file, and that eventually caused me to modify the .cc file for IWYU. I look forward to the day that a tool will handle IWYU for us!",

      "message": "I\u0027m conflicted here. I think there are actually two choices here:\n\n1. TearDown() vs test fixture destructor?\n\nOn one hand, I agree with you, symmetry is nice, it is kind of expected and intuitive. But to say that SetUp() is what\u0027s adding the observer on HistoryService, while true, it is also very non-obvious. My understand is HistoryService::AddObserver() gets called during the BlockUntiLHistoryProcessesPendingRequests(), when we receive an async callback into AutocompleteActionPredictor::CreateCaches().\n\nHowever, as per https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/FAQ.md#should-i-use-the-constructordestructor-of-the-test-fixture-or-the-set-uptear-down-function it seems clear we should prefer test fixture\u0027s constructor/destructor over SetUp()/TearDown(). I don\u0027t see any reason this cannot be in the destructor instead.\n\n2. Should we call AutocompleteActionPredictor::Shutdown() at all?\n\nThe purpose of this CL is to remove a unnecessary unit test cleanup call (DestroyHistoryService()) that was adding complexity to the code without clear benefit. And I saw this AutocompleteActionPredictor::Shutdown() call through that same lens, and thought it\u0027d be best to removed it. We don\u0027t verify that the Shutdown() call did anything, only that it doesn\u0027t crash. And more lines means more code to read and less understanding.\n\nHowever, this is AutocompleteActionPredictor\u0027s unit test, and we\u0027re not creating the AutocompleteActionPredictor through a KeyedServiceFactory, no one else is going to call AutocompleteActionPredictor::Shutdown() if we don\u0027t. And it kind of is part of the KeyedService\u0027s contract that Shutdown is going to be called before their destructors. Additionally, my change reduces the line coverage from this test, and I\u0027m not sure if there are other, more integration-y tests that cover the code inside of AutocompleteActionPredictor::Shutdown().\n\nI guess in a way, this kind of comes down to is this unit test a white or black box test? If we are allowed to see inside AutocompleteActionPredictor\u0027s implementation, then we know AutocompleteActionPredictor::Shutdown() doesn\u0027t really need to be called.\n\nLooking at the code inside of ~AutocompleteActionPredictorTest(), it doesn\u0027t seem clear to me why any of that needs to be there either, but I\u0027ve already spent far more time than I should have on this CL.\n\nAdding Shutdown() as the first call in the test fixture\u0027s destructor, and a meandering comment. Hopefully you find this approach somewhat reasonable.\n\nMaybe one day, when HistoryService is trivial to mock, we can verify that AutocompleteActionPredictorTest::Shutdown() calls HistoryService()::RemoveObserver(), and that ~AutocompleteActionPredictorTest() does not call HistoryService()::RemoveObserver() if AutocompleteActionPredictorTest::Shutdown() was called.",

      "message": "OK, thank you for the detailed description of your perspective!\n\nMy main motivation to ask about this was a feeling that making AutoCompleteActionPredictor better is outside of the scope this change (if I understand the purpose correctly). So in such case I lean towards not touching unrelated bad designs to avoid risks in spending a lot of time figuring out what\u0027s best for those designs.\n\nJust to clarify where I stand:\n1. symmetry is good, but not required\n2. unittests are whitebox\n3. thanks for reminding about test fixture lifetime, I forgot about it (again)\n4. I inherited this code with no good idea about the contract of calling KeyedService\u0027s Shutdown() - thanks, today I learned something\n\nThese [1-4] leans me towards what you did - moving Shutdown() to the d-tor. Thanks for that!\n\nAnother round of thanks and applause for attempts to leave code in a better place than it was!!",

      "message": "This is an awesome comment and really helped me understand why this logic was here. Luckily, I don\u0027t think we need it anymore, because of OnceClosure! I think the closure that holds onto the scoped_ptr\u003cHistoryBackend\u003e is going to get moved/destroyed at [1], right as |cb| goes out of scope. This is on the destination thread, so it\u0027s okay if this is the last reference. Though, I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s currently possible to make it be the last reference, as the |closing_task| from HistoryService::Cleanup() needs to run on the same backend thread, and is going to run after the OnceClosure from HistoryService::QueryDownloads() is run/destroyed.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/base/callback.h?l\u003d92",
