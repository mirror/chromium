      "message": "My quick reading of the code finds that a reconnectSession(sessionId) call from Cast SDK translates to a joinRoute(\"cast-session_\" + sessionId) call in MR, which the Cast MRP handles by stripping out the prefix and doing a match with sessionId against its session records.\n\nBecause the route also has presentation id \u003d\u003d sessionId, and we have code in Cast MRP that handles joining by presentation ID (i.e. non-prefixed with \"cast-session_\"), this seems to indicate that join should still continue to work if we stopped adding the prefix in reconectSession, at least in theory.\n\nMaybe this can be part of a future cleanup of route management in Cast MRP as there are other cleanups that would be nice to do as well.",
