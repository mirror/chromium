      "message": "Thanks for the concerns. \n\nActually my plan is to create an A/B testing group and compare the metrics on Android client for both group. And I created the experiment flag and measurement just to figure out the real performance on end users\u0027s clients. It will be just a temporary experiment (sorry, can\u0027t find other easy way than an feature experiment). \n\nSo we can have the baseline and help us improve the language list fetching further https://docs.google.com/document/d/15zgtr7btrLcf0Ng9GGCNn6AqZgVPFA7Yom6BziBxWsg (more following optimizations).",

One answer is we does not support \"en-us\". And based its original logic, \"zh-Hant\" is not supported either.
