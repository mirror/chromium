      "message": "This is never restored, so it looks like it will affect subsequent tests. (Right?)\n\nWhat about making a test utility that overrides this, with an interface similar to SimpleTestTickClock (and could life in wtf test support)? Something like this:\n\nnamespace WTF {\n\nclass ScopedMockClock {\n public:\n  ScopedMockClock()\n      : next_(top_),\n        next_time_function_(GetTimeFunctionForTesting()) {\n    top_ \u003d this;\n    SetTimeFunctionsForTesting(\u0026Now);\n  }\n  ~ScopedMockClock() {\n    top_ \u003d next_;\n    SetTimeFunctionsForTesting(next_time_function_);\n  }\n\n  // fascinating methods to manipulate the time\n\n  static double Now() { return top_-\u003enow_; }\n\n private:\n  static ScopedClockOverride* top_ \u003d nullptr;\n  ScopedClockOverride* next_;\n  TimeFunction next_time_function_;\n  // or possibly stored internally as a TimeTicks; whatever\n  double now_ \u003d 0.0;\n};\n\n}  // namespace WTF",
