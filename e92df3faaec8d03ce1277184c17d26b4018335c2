It doesn\u0027t make much sense on its own and depends on input from previous computation.\n\nI don\u0027t have any problem with exposing backShouldCloseTab() as that makes a lot of sense.\n\nMy suggestion would be to expose only the first one and just reimplement this logic inside Vr. I don\u0027t think it makese sense as a separate function like this.",
