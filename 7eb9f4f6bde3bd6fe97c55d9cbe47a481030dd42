      "message": "It\u0027s annoying we already have views::ImageButton::SetImageAlignment(..), but LabelButton only shares Button as a common base :/\n\nI think we want these APIs to be consistent (maybe one day we can delete ImageButton -- it can just be a LabelButton with an image but no text..). There is actually http://crbug.com/155363 still open, which might relate to this.\n\nI think a sensible step for this CL would be:\n - move ImageButton::VerticalAlignment to views::Button  (consistent, e.g., with Button::ButtonStyle in that it\u0027s not used in other parts of the Button API..)\n - name this void SetImageAlignment(VerticalAlignment v_align)\n\n\nI\u0027ll defer to msw@ on this since he\u0027s been absorbed in views buttons much longer than me for http://crbug.com/155363\n\n\n(I also considered [but I\u0027m leaning against] moving ImageButton::ComputeImagePaintPosition to something like Button::ComputeImagePaintOffset  -- this doesn\u0027t really fit\n\nit\u0027s also a bit confusing having gfx::HorizontalAlignment and ImageButton::HorizontalAlignment LabelButton uses gfx:: but ImageButton uses its own, but that doesn\u0027t need to be fixed now).",

I read one and hit reply on the other.\n\nAs I thought about this some more, when the image is taller than the line height, there isn\u0027t going to be enough slack above the first line or below the last line to allow for decent alignment. If the text is wrapped, and the image is taller than the a single line of text, the preferred height will need to be taller.",
