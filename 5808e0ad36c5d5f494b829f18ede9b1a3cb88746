My style would be to list the classes that will be defined in the file and talk about the relationships between them, but I don\u0027t have particular investment in that style; I just want something that\u0027ll give readers a framework to hang more detailed knowledge on.  I wouldn\u0027t be adverse to hoisting the comments about BodyReader and BodyHandler up to this point (as part of a larger comment).",
