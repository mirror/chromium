      "message": "Not sure what to do about the test here (and the EnsureFrameNavigationEntriesClearedOnMismatchNoSrc one below).  The test doesn\u0027t work because the 2 uniqueNames differ because of the dynamicFrameId being added by this CL (so - maybe it doesn\u0027t even make sense to keep the FNEs for dynamic frames after this CL, since they will never match a new dynamic frame).  Maybe I can/should rewrite the test in a way that uses static frames, but that strikes me as a test that is very dependent on the implementation it tests.\n\nWDYT?",
