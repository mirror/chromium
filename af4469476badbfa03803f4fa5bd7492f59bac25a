It\u0027s creating an EmbeddedWorkerInstanceClientImpl which is something that allows you to start and stop a service worker.\n\nI kinda think this should just be named CreateEmbeddedWorkerInstanceClient() and the comment explain the relationship to SW, until we figure out a better name than EmbeddedWorkerInstanceClient.",
