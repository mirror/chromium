      "message": "I don\u0027t like this part. The problem is that element_name can be null if there\u0027s no qualified name (e.g. class selector), but can now also be null if it\u0027s a universal selector. PrependTypeSelector needs to differentiate the two cases, so I had to save the return value and pass it down. This feels kinda ugly to me.\n\nMaybe ConsumeName could return a WTF::Optional\u003cQualifiedName\u003e or something? Any ideas?",
