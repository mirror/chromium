I don\u0027t think the async resolver is ready for that on any of the platforms where it\u0027s used, and I can\u0027t think of any problems with it that don\u0027t also exist with fallback to UDP when DoH doesn\u0027t work.\n\n(This function in its current state probably should have been deleted, the rest of it doesn\u0027t work anymore and that field trial hasn\u0027t run in a very long time.)",
