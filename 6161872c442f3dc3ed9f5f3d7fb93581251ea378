      "message": "So, unfortunately the paper- elements are not super well supported. We should consider carefully whether we want to add paper-toast since we will need fix any issues like this ourselves.\n\nI see that md-bookmarks has their own toast manager, have you spoken to the authors about their decision to do that instead of use paper-toast? It seems like we should handle toast UI consistently in MD WebUI. Maybe we can move toast bookmarks-toast-manager to ui/webui/resources/cr_components/cr_toast_manager/ and use it in both places?",
