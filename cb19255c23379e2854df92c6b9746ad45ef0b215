      "message": "nit: This CL description reads more like a message to the reviewers. I would write something like:\n\nShowcase is intended to be a standalone UI app and as such should not reference //ios/web or //ios/chrome. This CL eliminates the Showcase app creating an IOSChromeMain instance and thus\nimplicitly being an //ios/web embedder, instead directly inlining the minimal parts of that startup that are needed (initializing base::CommandLine and loading resources). As part of that change, this CL eliminates Showcase bundling //ios/web resources.",
