      "message": "It looks like you are not resetting the tintColor of the accessoryView in -prepareForReuse. Would this cause the color to be incorrect if the cell is reused for a different accessoryType?\n\nI also do not really like the fact that we have to add the same check to all -configureCell: implementation. Could we move this to a category on MDCCollectionViewCell? Or even sub-class it. This way, we\u0027ll only put the check in a single location (and won\u0027t have to go back to all those location if we need another tint color for another type of accessory).\n\nSo, either:\n\n  @implementation MDCCollectionViewCell (ChromeAccessoryTypeCategory)\n\n  - (void)cr_setAccessoryType:(MDCCollectionViewCellAccessoryType)accessoryType {\n    self.accessoryType \u003d accessoryType;\n    if (accessoryType \u003d\u003d MDCCollectionViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator)\n      self.accessoryView.tintColor \u003d [[MDCPalette greyPalette] tint400];\n  }\n\n  @end\n\nor:\n\n  @interface ChromeCollectionViewCell : MDCCollectionViewCell\n  @end\n\n  @implementation ChromeCollectionViewCell\n\n  - (void)setAccessoryType:(MDCCollectionViewCellAccessoryType)accessoryType {\n    [super setAccessoryType:accessoryType];\n    if (accessoryType \u003d\u003d MDCCollectionViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator)\n      self.accessoryView.tintColor \u003d [[MDCPalette greyPalette] tint400];\n  }\n\n  @end",

      "message": "The accessoryView get set to nil by the super implementation of -prepareForReuse, so there shouldn\u0027t be any problems. Just to be sure I did some experiments to confirm this is the case.\n\nI went with the category option since we already have a Chrome category for MDCCollectionViewCell.\n\nI don\u0027t think setting the other accessoryType values to blue would be a good idea since they are actually using UIKit\u0027s default tint color, and MDC should never override that. On the other hand there\u0027s no programmatic color for that, and I wouldn\u0027t like using an RGB combination that approaches that blue. Finally in the case we want to fix that color value we can easily do it on the category method.",
