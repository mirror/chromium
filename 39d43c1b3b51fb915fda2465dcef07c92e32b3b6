      "message": "It seems like the current mocks want to hide this section entirely when no cookie is selected, and my hope is to punt that to a later Harmony phase.\n\nIn the absence of making that change, does it make sense to omit this one as well?  The placeholders seem to make this section feel a bit less \"broken\".  I tried to look for why Jayson originally asked for these to be removed, but the older mocks are gone (that I could find).  Did you discuss this with Alan?",
