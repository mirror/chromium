That can come in a later CL along with UMA/UKM/RAPPOR to help us understand if/when we can fully drop support for muxed \u0027sequence\u0027 append mode. I\u0027ve filed https://crbug.com/737757 to track such work, now that it\u0027s obtained support from Mozilla on the MSE spec issue.\n\nFrom further thought, I\u0027ve filed https://crbug.com/737768 to track documenting those levels better (and perhaps reclassify many of the existing DEBUG to be INFO and change the DEBUG MediaLog level type name/text to be WARNING).\n\nDone.",
