Either you don\u0027t expect this to be called in this test fixture (so NOTIMPLEMENTED() or something like it) or the client will call it, and you\u0027ll need to do something in response?",

Maybe worth a comment about why there\u0027s no race with OnResponseBodyStreamReady()?  (I\u0027m in favor of the DCHECK and neutral about the comment, but it did take me a little bit of time scanning code to be comfortable that there isn\u0027t a race with OnResponseBodyStreamRead().)",
