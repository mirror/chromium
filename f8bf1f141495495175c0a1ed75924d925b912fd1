      "message": "I did some later research that suggested we leak slightly more memory than your comment [based on my first comment] currently indicates. PDEs never get cleaned up. This means that we leak 2^10 bytes every 2^22 bytes of address space we use. So confining the hint to 2^39 bytes, will confine the leak to 2^10 * 2^17 bytes, ~128MB. This still seems much higher than desired. Is there a particular reason you want 39-bits of virtual address space?",
