      "message": "OK, now I\u0027m thinking that this |sources_assignment_filter| thing must automatically assign anthing in android/linux/mac/win dirs to get into the appropriate build.  And so the override was to tell Android to also pick up the linux/WebFontRendering.cpp file.\n\nSo the change I have made is to duplicate linux/WebFontRendering.cpp into core/layout/WebFontRendering[Android|Linux] and then include each into the respective build.  This matches the pattern currently used in https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/layout/BUILD.gn?l\u003d470\u0026rcl\u003d5c1806ffc432d6cecec9ea2480066f738bda84bf",
