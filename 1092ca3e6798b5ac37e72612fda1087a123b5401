      "message": "The code was originally a RenderWidgetProtector class in RenderWidget.cpp https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/1eb5649aba8a1252cae87d0b01af6481fdf86628 which was then merged into RenderPart, which became LayoutPart https://codereview.chromium.org/625073002\n, which is now LayoutEmbeddedContent.\n\nThe original comment when the code was introduced mentions protecting RenderWidget from destruction during a function - I assume SetFrameRect.  I can\u0027t see how that can be relevant for the LayoutEmbeddedContent object right now.\n\nTests all pass fine without this code.",
