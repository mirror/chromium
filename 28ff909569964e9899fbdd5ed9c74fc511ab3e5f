      "message": "WorkerGlobalScope is also used for workers other than ServiceWorker, so I\u0027d like to avoid ServiceWorker-specific code in WorkerGlobalScope as much as possible (we already use InstalledScriptsManager in WorkerThread though). \n\nInstead, how about adding |virtual bool WorkerGlobalScope::LoadScript(url, ...)|? WorkerGlobalScope implements it the existing behavior and ServiceWorkerGlobalScope overrides it for the script streaming. If ServiceWorkerGlobalScope::LoadScript() cannot handle a request, it can fallback to WorkerGlobalScope::LoadScript().\n\nWhat do you think?",
