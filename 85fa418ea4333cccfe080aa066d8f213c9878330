      "message": "If I understand correctly, this logic will cause all the untracked databases to be reported as \"leveldatabase/0x00000000\" (8 more zeroes on 64-bit). I mildly prefer the approach I suggested in https://crrev.com/2983723002 where ToTrackedDB() behaves more like blink\u0027s To*. (unconditional static_cast with DCHECK)\n\nI\u0027d be happy to chat about this in person and learn about your reasoning for this approach, if you have some time!",
