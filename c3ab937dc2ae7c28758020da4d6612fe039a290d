      "message": "Added the documentation.\n\nI\u0027m going to use this \"weakly\" as an escape hatch. The enum literals for this one I can think of are DocumentLoadBlocked and DocumentLoadNotBlocked, which makes reader consider them as valid options for a successful load.\n\nIn our case DocumentLoadBlocked is closer to a failure and this whole concept of fooling Blink with 0 content is somewhat a hack. I was hoping we could eventually convert it to an actual failure with a reason, in which case it would make sense for failure reason to be enum. Does it make sense?",
