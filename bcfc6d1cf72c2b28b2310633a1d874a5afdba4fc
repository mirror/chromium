      "message": "This is dangerous. The delegate may have decided that this task does not need to be kept alive, and may destroy it immediately in OnDownloadCreated. Or more simply, if delegate_ is null, then the scoped unique_ptr\u003c\u003e will be destroyed and the task deleted.\n\nSo, there are two cases to consider to see how to fix. First we need to consider the case when delegate_ is null. If this is supported, then we should do the following:\n\n  if (!delegate_)\n    return nullptr;\n\n  delegate_-\u003e...\n\nAnother option is to DCHECK that delegate_ is non-null at this point.\n\nOnce the question of delegate_ is solved, we need to address returning a raw pointer to an object that may have been deleted by the delegate. I think the simplest is to check whether task_ptr is still in alive_tasks_ before returning it:\n\n  delegate_-\u003eOnDownloadCreated(this, web_state, std::move(task));\n  \n  // The delegate may have decided to discard the DownloadTask, so\n  // check whether it is still alive. If not, return null.\n  if (!base::ContainsValue(alive_tasks_, task_ptr))\n    return nullptr;\n\n  return task_ptr;\n\nAnother option is to DCHECK that task_ptr is still in the alive_tasks_ at this point (it needs to be added as a comment to OnDownloadCreated that the DownloadTask must still be valid when the method return then).",
