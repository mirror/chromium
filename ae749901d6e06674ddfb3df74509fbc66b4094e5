      "message": "is this from somewhere else? it sounds like it\u0027s maybe referring to rows that appear in the tray itself, which i think that this isn\u0027t supposed to -- it should only appear as a standalone bubble when the keyboard brightness is adjusted.\n\ni have to admit that the tray code has always confused me a bit and i\u0027m never sure where anything is going to be displayed (i.e. i\u0027m guessing that these views are typically used both in the tray and in bubbles). xiyuan@ might know more, or might know of someone who does.\n\nre the above default_view variable, i see this description in ash/system/tray/system_tray_item.h:\n\n// Tray view - The icon in the status area in the shelf.\n// Default view - The row in the top-level menu.\n// Detailed view - The submenu shown when the top-level menu row is clicked.\n\ni\u0027d expect this to not have a detailed view, in that case (assuming that the default view is also used for bubbles).",
