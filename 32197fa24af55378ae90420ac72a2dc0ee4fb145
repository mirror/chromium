      "message": "nit: this implicitly assumes that the current thread is the UI thread, though it is not enforced anywhere.\nI think the risk is low here, but can you either:\n- Use new Handler(ThreadUtils.getUiThreadLooper()), or\n- Add ThreadUtils.removeUiThreadCallbacks() and not have any member here.\n\nI would tend to prefer the second solution as it reduces the amount of member variables there are here, but up to you.",
