      "message": "Just a thought for a possible follow-up, probably not something we want to do until we need it, but it would be nice to be able to validate \"I got this stats object, the stats that are implemented are of the correct type and any reference it has lead to existing stats objects\" without having to also validate \"the stats objects are fully implemented, all mandatory stats are present\". Essentially an argument to turn \"assert_blah\"s into \"assert_optional_blah\"s.\n\nThis would allow test testing the behavior \"before we connect, track stats should be present\" with a lower bar for what it means to be \"track stats\", as to not fail because the behavior \"track stats are fully implemented\" fails.\n\nThere will likely be some stats missing here and there for quite some time and WPT are implemented against the spec.",
