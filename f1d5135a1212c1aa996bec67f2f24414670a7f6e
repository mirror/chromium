      "message": "\u003e Why would plugin controller creation fail? It looks like it\u0027s doing some mime type checks, but shouldn\u0027t those have been handled already?\n\nHere are the reasons it might fail:\n 1- The flag is not set (kPdfExtensionInCrossProcessFrame)\n 2- BUILD_FLAG(ENABLE_PLUGINS) is not set.\n 3- BUILD_FLAG(ENABLE_EXTENSIONS) is not set.\n 4- We don\u0027t have a handler for the mime-type\nNow my implementation of \"reason 4\" is missing from this patch. But basicaly what we do right now before creating BrowserPlugin is to send IPCs to browser the query the mime type and the handler for the given URL. See here:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/renderer/render_frame_impl.cc?rcl\u003d4a7d884be5a9e4268cefc56ec2747979254f7b29\u0026l\u003d2977\n\nand here on chrome/ layer.\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/renderer/chrome_content_renderer_client.cc?rcl\u003d89b6ce1ae3701d825a5519a156d6110c0b5e8e9a\u0026l\u003d686\n\nWe do override the mime-type if needed and determine if a handler for the plugin exists. Right now I am not doing any of these but I suppose these steps in creating browser plugin should be eventually carried over.\n\n\u003e At the very least, it would be nice to just defer creation of the new frame until we know that CreatePluginController() is going to succeed--perhaps they should even be paired somehow.\n\nThe reason I created the frame before the controller was to make sure the when the controller is created we do have a frame (to send the load request for the PDF resource right away). But I looking at the code again after changes it looks like this is not a mandatory assumption so I will change this code to create the controller first and create the frame only if controller creation is successful.",
