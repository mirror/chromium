That way we don\u0027t have to mention the command-line flag here. The rest of our code uses \"S13nServiceWorker\" as the common way to refer to this code path:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/#search/\u0026q\u003ds13nserviceworker\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026type\u003dcs\n\n(much like how we had comments referring to \"PlzNavigate\" and code checking \"--enable-features\u003dBrowserSideNavigation\")",
