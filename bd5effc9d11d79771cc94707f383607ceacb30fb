I *think* this one is safe, because I can\u0027t see any other places that use the same file paths as the ones here.  But please double check that, and it probably at least warrants a comment.\n\nI also a CL up (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/593854/) today that will create an extensions file task runner, if you think it would be better to just wait for that and use it here.",
