      "message": "This seems a bit weird, is there a better pattern for creating/loading/enabling an extension for unit tests? (ie. ActivateExtensionInProcess isn\u0027t even called here; it\u0027s not immediately obvious how that\u0027s relevant; your comment \"when navigating to it later\" is a decent breadcrumb, but this isn\u0027t ideal). Perhaps we should have a test helper function that encapsulates the complexity of loading a test extension elsewhere, and that can call RendererStartupHelper::OnExtensionLoaded, ExtensionRegistry::AddEnabled, and whatever else; I\u0027d be surprised if that doesn\u0027t already exist. ditto comment for the other test file",
