      "message": "Does OriginTainted() true also imply that the SourceGraphic is used in the InputEffect(1) subgraph? Otherwise, this check may be overly-restrictive. You can have a tainted origin and still use FEDisplacementMap, so long as input 1\u0027s subgraph does not reference SourceGraphic (e.g., using FETurbulence).",

      "message": "It does not mean that SourceGraphic is used. Tainting can happen from the input coming\nfrom a filter which taints its output. This is why some of the tests had to be rebaselined,\nbecause images and flood don\u0027t understand how to not taint when not necessary. I filed\na bug related to this.",
