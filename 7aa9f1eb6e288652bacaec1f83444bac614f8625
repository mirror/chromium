      "message": "I think technically we should also include \ncontent_settings_types.h \ncontent_settings.h\nWebFeaturePolicy.h ?\n\nIn general I think there are likely to be many \"include what you use\" errors throughout the codebase with no tooling to prevent them. I don\u0027t think it is the best use of time to fix/review these errors without other code changes. This CL is fine, but you may not want to pursue the task of trying to fix all such problems without appropriate tooling.",

      "message": "This is not a patch for a random \"include what you use\" problem. This particular missing include causes compilation error for us at Opera. Although we currently don\u0027t modify this .cc file, we modify other .h files. url/gurl.h include is not needed in these modified .h files but this .cc file needs it. I think this is the correct way to fix the compilation issue for us. It also improves Chromium code by fixing \"include what you use\" problems in this file (though I understand that creating patches like this is not a solution for this kind of problems in general).\n\nI also added the rest of missing includes in this file. Thanks for pointing out.",
