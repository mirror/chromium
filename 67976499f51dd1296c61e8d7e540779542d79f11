      "message": "I think this routine is doing too much at once. I\u0027d break it into at least three parts:\n\n1) A part that computes the hashes for a given directory tree (i.e., rewrites the JSON and returns the new JSON + a mapping of old file -\u003e new file)\n2) A part that creates a new directory tree given the results from (1).\n3) A part that uploads the new tree.\n\nThis splits out the part that has computation and interesting logic into a pure function, and then the parts that have side effects and talk to the filesystem and network and can be tested separately.\n\nIf I was really ambitious, I\u0027d actually use the \"host\" abstractions from typ, so that you don\u0027t have to do all of the mocking you\u0027re doing. In fact, I kinda wonder if this should just be added to typ instead since there\u0027s a lot of overlap w/ the code in typ.json_results, and we need to make sure we update typ to stay in sync as well.",
