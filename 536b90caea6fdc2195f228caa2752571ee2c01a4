      "message": "All of the local printing, plus mac open in preview and windows print with system dialog, used to call hidePreview instead. hidePreview differs from closing the dialog in that the dialog web contents are handed off to the background printing manager before cleaning up the constrained web dialog etc: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/ui/webui/print_preview/print_preview_ui.cc?l\u003d653\n\nThe purpose of this is to store the Print Preview web contents while still having the visual effect of the dialog disappearing. The reason for doing that here was to allow the renderer to access the plugin inside the preview dialog. In the current printing code the renderer is notified to print the contents of the plugin when the user prints to a local printer/Preview/system dialog so the plugin needs to stay alive until the print job is spooled. This CL is trying to change things so we instead tell the printing code to start a print job directly from the Handler with the PDF data that is stored in PrintPreviewDataStore. This is how all the other printer types already work.",
