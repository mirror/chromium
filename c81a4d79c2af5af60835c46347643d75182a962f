      "message": "The intent of this method is to know how many tasks can be scheduled and *actually* run in parallel. Using |worker_capacity_| is wrong the minute it becomes dynamic as the capacity will grow beyond the number of (non-blocked) tasks that can run in parallel.\n\nMaybe we need to store params.max_threads() in a member as well?",
