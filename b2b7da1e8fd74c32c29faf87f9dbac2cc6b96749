      "message": "Not really. From Android documents, only BP is guaranteed in MediaCodec. So we can\u0027t be sure that all the chips can report/work in CBP, even QCOMM does it actually.\nThe problem here is some peer only expects CBP. So the real capabilities of chips don\u0027t really matter here. Forcing it to be CBP for most compatibility in intercommunication is not really good, but works for now...\nHope we can perfect it in the future.",
