This should normally not happen, however due to the way Chrome is built and upreved on CrOS, and the fact that libva is a separate package, this message has been helpful in keeping track of incompatibility-related issues.",

      "message": "I\u0027m possibly missing something, but we used to refcount_++ on each call to Initialize(), with this change we only increment refcount to 1 and not more. If a client calls Initialize() twice, I think refcount_ will stay at 1, and calling this will deinitialize libva while the second Initialize() client is still active/using it?\nAlso, the refcount will go down to -1, so further calls to Initialize() will initialize libva more than once while it\u0027s \u003c 1?",
