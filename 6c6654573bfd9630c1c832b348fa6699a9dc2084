      "message": "\u003e This doesn\u0027t actually animate. Do you need is to animate?\n\nWell, maybe not. The call to SetOpacity ends up going into a LayerAnimator, so I thought it was doing a fast animation. Ah, but without a ScopedLayerAnimationSettings, the duration is 0. I\u0027ll check with UX to see if the animation is necessary.\n\n\u003e Also, be aware that if you don\u0027t change the visibility this button is still really there, which could effect screen readers and other things.\n\nThanks for pointing that out. Will it suffice to only flip visibility and leave opacity alone?",
