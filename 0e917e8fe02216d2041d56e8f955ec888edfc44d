Could ya tell me more about why the focus would be lost (I\u0027d like to suggest not using setTimeout if it can be avoided, but I don\u0027t know enough about this case to say if it can be avoided). \n\nMaybe I should say: please check to see if there is a way to avoid using a setTimeout and avoid using setTimeout if that\u0027s reasonable. If not, just tell me a bit more about why setTimeout is unavoidable.",
