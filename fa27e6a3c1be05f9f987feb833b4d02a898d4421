Looks like is_deleted()/is_deleted_ is used only in CompleteFindNow()[1] other than devtools/DCHECKs to avoid returning a deleted registration. I wonder if we should not return an uninstalled registration there, too.\n\n(I just quickly looked through the code and may be missing something)\n\n[1] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/b24a111a60e8baca13a1176fff468aec98cc7c44/content/browser/service_worker/service_worker_storage.cc#53",
