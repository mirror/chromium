      "message": "This seems like a worthwhile test to keep in some form.  It certainly still applies to the new UI.  Similar to the suggestion for the policy browsertest, I\u0027d probably just suggest using different strings to query the UI, but the rest should stay constant.",

      "message": "So, unfortunately both of my attempts (one with UI polling as the old test, one with MutationObserver) flaked on the bots and got reverted (I was never able to repro the flakiness locally). Given the amount of time already spent on these unsuccessful attepms, I am OK with not porting this to the MD page and simply rely on unit tests.",
