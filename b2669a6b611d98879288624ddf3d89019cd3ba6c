      "message": "Done. The way I approached this was to create a new property (foobar_hit_testable_) which defaulted to false and needed to be updated to be true. I then whacked moles until foobar_hit_testable_ and hit_testable_ were exactly the same, at which point I got rid of the silly name as well as all the now useless set_hit_testable(false) calls.\n\nThings look much nicer. Thank you very much for this suggestion, Chris!",
