      "message": "Could it happen that we have not logged outcomes at this point (and mFeaturesToLog contains inference features) if writeLogAndReset is called from the destructor? If for some reason, the condition in runPredictionForTapSuppression was false at the time, and changed to true before writeLogAndReset has been called?\n\nWouldn\u0027t it be more reliable to call this function from ContextualSearchPanelMetrics.writeRankerLoggerOutcomesAndReset where we actually record the outcomes? Or, would it be worth to log both of these events, since we still are in the dark about why the outcomes are not being logged?",

      "message": "We do want to log these. Thanks for adding them.\nYou should also add them to tools/metrics/ukm/ukm.xml. Otherwise, features that are not in ukm.xml will not show up in readable ukm logs. I used that file to build the whitelist, and we should keep them in sync . Could you please add a comment that mentions this. \nEventually, we should be able to use directly the ukm API, and rely only on ukm.xml. But a few pieces are still missing on the ukm side to allow this.",
