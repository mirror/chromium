      "message": "On the one hand, I\u0027m a little wary of this -- Rules should call their own setup logic, and inheritance should be left out of it.\n\nOn the other hand, I imagine this is a case where order of execution matters -- you need mTestCommon.setUp to be called before PermissionTestRule does its thing. This seems like something that could be defined in a more abstract Rule base class -- something that\u0027s responsible for just ruleSetUp and ruleTearDown and provided empty implementations of each.\n\nIf we do decide to (or have to) do ruleSetUp and ruleTearDown, I certainly think they should be done in the same place (as opposed to the current implementation, which does the former here and the latter down in PermissionTestRule).",

      "message": "Just in very general terms, if we can avoid using inheritance, that would be great! Particularly for rules, since part of the point there was re-use and not requiring particular inheritance, etc., so it\u0027s probably wise to use the same concept for everything related to rules as far as we can.",
