      "message": "This feels semantically wrong. It should be exceptional that you cannot click on a notification, not the other way around. This CL would now change all Web Notifications to lose their mouse cursor (per your TODO in platform_notification_service_impl.cc), and potentially others since there are ~40 delegates, and only 11 that override HasClickedListener().\n\nGoing the opposite direction (defaulting the delegate\u0027s method to TRUE) feels much safer. WDYT?",
