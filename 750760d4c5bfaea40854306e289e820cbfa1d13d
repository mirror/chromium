      "message": "Done - although I somehow failed to see that you wrote \"!Style()-\u003eHasOutOfFlowPosition()\", so I did !IsFloatingOrOutOfFlowPositioned() instead - which is closer to what the spec tells us to anyway. Any reason not to trust the information in the layout objects when calling this method? Otherwise I see no need for using Style(). As far as I can tell, this code isn\u0027t invoked via code like Style{Did,Will}Change().\n\nThis change isn\u0027t going to affect behavior, but it will save some time when called on an out-of-flow LEGEND element.",
