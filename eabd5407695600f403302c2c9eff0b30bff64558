      "message": "Hrm, you may be right.\n\nI am finding it very difficult to tease out all the possible interactions of rAFs and animations that should/shouldn\u0027t record a draw interval. My most recent thought is \u0027what if a pending rAF is cancelled?\u0027. I think that could lead to a huge draw interval recorded:\n\nFrame N-1:\n  * rAF runs (current_frame_had_raf \u003d true), registers a new rAF (next_frame_has_pending_raf \u003d true)\n  * later, pending rAF is cancelled (click/scroll handler? setInterval?)\n  * previous_frame_had_raf_ is set to true here, because we don\u0027t know the pending rAF was (were) cancelled.\n[Time passes, no frame]\n\nFrame N:\n  * Another rAF is triggered from setInterval (current_frame_had_raf \u003d true)\n  * Here, we then get that current_frame_had_raf is true and previous_frame_had_raf_ is true, so record a big draw diff.\n\nI must admit I\u0027m not sure if a pending rAF can be cancelled like this, but overall this just seems so delicate.",
