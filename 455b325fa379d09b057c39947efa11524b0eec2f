      "message": "Interestingly, I was misunderstanding until I investigated this, but glyph_bounding_box is logical, so advance is always X. The bound we get for a glyph is physical, and this needs to be fixed. This is #3, but until then, I think X is good. I actually tried Y, which breaks more severely, because layout code assumes that ShapeResult::glyph_bounding_box_ is logical.",
