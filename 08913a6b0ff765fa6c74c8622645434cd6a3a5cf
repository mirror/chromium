      "message": "No, not a drop-in replacement, and there is (quite unfortunately) external code which depends on the old stuff - namely media router. Of course I don\u0027t know if we still actively ship the media router extension, maybe we don\u0027t. In that case I\u0027d be happy to delete this.",
