      "message": "So my thought was WebPrefs is more complicated cuz they change at runtime, so we could just pass the command line thru to the renderer, parse it in RenderThreadImpl and have it expose IsPepper3dDisabled() for pepper to read.\n\nAre webprefs preferred piman? I know command line sucks but also passing things once constly at startup is nice too (and we could replace command line with something else orthogonally that isnt webprefs one day the dreammm)",
