      "message": "Will this accurately synthesize the real world situation where GetInterface would as close as possible after DidCommitProvisionalLoad? \n\nI wonder if we are still sending the GetInterface message too late, and maybe we should have it posted to the MessageLoop just before we synchronously invoke DidCommitProvisionalLoad?",

      "message": "Posting it to the message loop will allow potentially other messages to be processed before the GetInterface one, right? I think that is less desirable as we want to simulate it coming as the first possible message after commit. Given that DidFinishNavigation is called on the same event loop with DidCommitProvisionalLoad, but after it has been processed, it does seem closer to what we want than using a PostTask, doesn\u0027t it?",
