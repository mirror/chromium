      "message": "I think anything that triggers navigation should call navigateTo directly, otherwise manager will have to have an additional listener per event-that-triggers-navigation again, which I think is less preferable than having to know about navigateTo.\n\nI don\u0027t think there\u0027s additional burden for an element to have to know about navigateTo (aside from closure-compiler target dependency), since navigation_helper.html is included at a higher level already anyway, so extensions.navigation.navigateTo will always exist anyway. \n\nAs an example, in settings, we also treat settings.Router as a global thing that always exists within the settings namespace.",
