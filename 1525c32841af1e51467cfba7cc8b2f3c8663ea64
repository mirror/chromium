      "message": "I\u0027m not amazingly keen on templated classes defined in a header that nothing else can use.  I think that pattern works when you have only a couple of types (e.g. Layer and LayerImpl) for a particular thing.  However, this looks a lot like it\u0027s trying to be extensible, but nothing else can use this code?\n\nIf there\u0027s only going to be one type of this, then maybe this all should merge together untemplated into SolidColorAnalyzer?\n\nOr, are there going to be other users?",

      "message": "I was hoping to use it for discardable image gathering as as a way for us to dump a pob into tracing. However, khushalsagar@ mentioned that perhaps the image gathering should stay the same, and I don\u0027t know if tracing is a compelling enough case for keeping it separate. WDYT?",
