      "message": "I just switched this one flag for illustration. It seems that none of the tests that run under TSAN on gpu.fyi is whitelisted for v8. Are the normal gpu (non-fyi) tests not suitable for tsan?\n\nIf I add the V8 predicate to one of the fyi tests like this one, it also gets added to the other (non-tsan) V8 bots. Not sure if we want that.\n\nIf we don\u0027t, we probably need to refactor this generator a bit to distinguish between v8-like-normal-gpu-bot and v8-like-fyi-gpu-bot.\n\nIf we do, we\u0027ll get a bit more load on GPU bots due to the extra testing on the three other bots.\n\n@ulan and kbr: Independent of this, do you think that all tests running under tsan on gpu.fyi are useful to run in v8?",

      "message": "Our team ran into significant problems trying to run the Telemetry-based tests under TSAN on Linux. See http://crbug.com/691029 . Basically, any test which brought up the browser would hang. It wasn\u0027t clear whether this was because of the many errors being flagged by TSAN (for which jbauman@ added suppressions a couple of months ago), or some other deeper problem. Unfortunately, these are the tests that would exercise V8. angle_perftests and others run no JavaScript and would not be useful on the client.v8.fyi waterfall.\n\nI\u0027ll try turning on one of the Telemetry-based tests again in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/548958 . If it works then we can remove the disabled_instrumentation_types directives for a bunch of the other tests.",
