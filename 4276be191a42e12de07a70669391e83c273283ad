      "message": "Another option would be to move dismissTabSwitcher into a separate protocol and have StackViewController register as the handler.  That would let you revert the changes in the toolbar files, and we wouldn\u0027t have to publicly expose the stackButton anymore.\n\nMark, do you have a preference for one option or another?",

      "message": "I think we should adopt in this CL the flow we\u0027ll want for the future tab switcher. If buttons are attached dispatched commands, then StackViewController and TabSwitcherController should both register for these commands (as well as the new impl when it comes).\n\nWhat about\n\n@protocol TabSwitcherCommands\n- (void)dismissTabSwitcher;\n@end\n\n(Alternative is adding to BrowserCommands, but that looks like a misuse?)",
