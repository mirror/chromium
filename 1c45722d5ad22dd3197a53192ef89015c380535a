(50 tends to be a pretty reasonable default for most use cases, which is why I\u0027m asking.)\n\nNote that if you do change this new histogram to use 50 buckets, you likely will want to use a separate constant for it, as it\u0027s important not to change the bucket layout for existing histograms that are also using this same constant.",
