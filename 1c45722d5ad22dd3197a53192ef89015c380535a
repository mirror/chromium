(50 tends to be a pretty reasonable default for most use cases, which is why I\u0027m asking.)\n\nNote that if you do change this new histogram to use 50 buckets, you likely will want to use a separate constant for it, as it\u0027s important not to change the bucket layout for existing histograms that are also using this same constant.",

      "message": "VR.Component.Assets.DurationUntilReady.OnRegisterComponent will report the same values as VR.Component.Assets.DurationUntilReady.OnChromeStart except of a few edge cases. That is why I use the same granularity. Initially, this granularity was chosen since we expect the majority of the values to be around 0 and 6 mins. With 100 buckets we get a reasonable precision around the 6 mins mark.",

      "message": "Ok.  For future reference, if you find yourself needing several histograms that all have a similar structure, then it would be best to design them to use fewer than 100 buckets.  But, for a single histogram, this is probably the simplest approach, and good enough.",
