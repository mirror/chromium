/**
 * This class contains logic for capturing navigation info at an appropriate time.
 *
 * There are three triggers this class considers:
 * - Initial - a short time after a page's onload.
 * - Backup - a longer time after a page's onload.
 * - First Meaningful Paint (FMP) - a medium time after a page's first meaningful paint occurs.
 *
 * The first meaningful paint is the best signal we have to determine that the page is in a usable
 * state, but with some caveats:
 * - It happens after a few seconds so the user may load a page then exit before it occurs. We use
 * the 'initial' trigger to provide a poor but "better than nothing" capture in this case.
 * - It may not trigger at all. We use the 'backup' trigger to provide a good capture here.
 * - It may occur before onload.
 *
 * Therefore, we capture on the 'initial' trigger (unless FMP has already occurred), and then
 * on the first of 'backup' or 'FMP'.
