 * A class representing information about a saved password entry in Chrome's settngs.
 *
 * Note: This could be a nested class in the PasswordManagerHandler interface, but that would mean
 * that PasswordUIView, which implements that interface and references SavedPasswordEntry in some of
 * its JNI-registered methods, would need an explicit import of PasswordManagerHandler. That again
 * would violate our presubmit checks, and https://crbug.com/424792 indicates that the preferred
 * solution is to move the nested class to top-level.
