/**
 * An annotation for listing what types of ChromeActivity the test should be restricted to.
 * This is meant to only be used with test classes that have a VrActivityRestrictionRule,
 * otherwise the annotation will have no effect.
 *
 * For example, the following would restrict a test to only run in ChromeTabbedActivity and
 * CustomTabActivity:
 *     <code>
 *     @VrActivityRestriction({VrActivityRestriction.CTA, VrActivityRestriction.CCT})
 *     </code>
 * If a test is not annotated with this and VrActivityRestrictionRule is present, the test
 * will default to only running in ChromeTabbedActivity (regular Chrome).
