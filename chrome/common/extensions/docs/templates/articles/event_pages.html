<h1 id="top-heading">Event and Background Pages</h1>


<p>
Background pages are Chrome Extensions answer to a common need for
single long-running scripts to manage a task or state. They are JavaScript files
that aid in the functionality and communication between your Extension and the
Chrome browser.
Background pages come in two flavors, persistent and non-persistent event pages.
</p>

<p>
Non persistent background pages,
event pages, are considered best practice when building an Extension.
They are loaded only when needed to fulfill a specific task or answer a call.
When an event page is not actively doing something, it is unloaded, freeing
memory and other system resources. This provides a considerable performance
advantage, especially on low-power devices.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Event pages are preferred to persistent background pages whenever possible.</strong>
</p>

{{?is_apps}}
<p>
Chrome Apps always use event pages instead of background pages.
It is not possible for a Chrome App to have a persistent background page.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>
Register your event page in the
<a href="manifest">extension manifest</a>
with the "persistent" feild set to false.
</p>

{{^is_apps}}
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  <b>"background": {
    "scripts": ["eventPage.js"],
    "persistent": false
  }</b>,
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>
If the function of your extension absolutely depends on a persistent script,
you can register a background page by updating the "persistent" field to true.
</p>

<p>
If you need to specify HTML in your event page,
you can do that using the page property instead:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  <b>"background": {
     "page": "background.html",
     "persistent": false
  }</b>,
  ...
}
</pre>

{{/is_apps}}
{{?is_apps}}
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "My app",
  ...
  "app": {
    <b>"background": {
      "scripts": ["eventPage.js"]
    }</b>
  }
  ...
}
</pre>
{{/is_apps}}

<p>
In many cases, an event page does not require any HTML markup.
This can be implemented using JavaScript files alone.
</p>

<h2 id="registration">Event Registration</h2>

<p>
Chrome will keep track of events that an extension has specified listeners for.
When a listener is triggered, the event page is loaded.
</p>

<p>
Listeners only exist in the context of the event page,
therefore you must use <code>addListener</code> each time the event page loads.
Only doing so at <code>$(ref:runtime.onInstalled)</code> is insufficient.
Recurring events should be located at the top scope of your functions
- they must be registered synchronously.
Conversely, if the extension removes all of its listeners
for an event by calling <code>removeListener</code>,
Chrome will no longer load the page for that event.
</p>

<p>
For an example of event registration in action, you can view the
<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/extensions/gmail/">Google Mail
Checker</a> extension.
</p>

<h2 id="lifetime">Lifetime</h2>

<p>
Both event pages and persistent background pages exsist in one instance at a time.
The only exception occurs if your extension uses <a href="manifest/incognito#split">incognito "split" mode</a>,
a second instance is created for incognito windows.
</p>

<h3 id="event-lifetime">Event Pages</h3>

<p>
Event pages are only loaded when Chrome dispatches an event
it is listening for, and unloaded when it goes idle again.
Here are some additional examples of things that will cause the event page to load:

<ul>
  <li>The app or extension is first installed or is updated to a new version
  - in order to <a href="#registration">register for events</a>.
  <li>A content script or other extension <a href="messaging">sends a message</a>.
  <li>Another view in the extension
    - for example, a popup -
    calls <code>$(ref:runtime.getBackgroundPage)</code>.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Once loaded, the event page will stay running as long as it is active
- for example, calling an extension API or issuing a network request.
Additionally, the event page will not unload until all visible views
- for example, popup windows -
are closed, along with all message ports.
Note that opening a view does not cause the event page to load,
but will prevent it from closing once loaded.
</p>

<p>
Event pages should close as soon as the event that opened it is processed.
You can observe the lifetime of your event page by opening Chrome's task manager.
You can see when your event page loads and unloads by observing when an entry
for your extension appears in the list of processes.
</p>

<p>
After the event page has been idle a few seconds,
the <code>$(ref:runtime.onSuspend)</code> event is dispatched.
The event page has a few more seconds to handle this event before it is forcibly unloaded.
If during this time an event occurs which would normally cause the event page to be loaded,
the suspend is canceled and the <code>$(ref:runtime.onSuspendCanceled)</code> event is dispatched.
</p>

<h3 id="background-lifetime">Background Pages</h3>

<p>
Persistent background pages exist for the lifetime of your extension,
and only one instance of it at a time is active.

</p>

<p>
Only use persistent background scripts if absolutely necessary.
</p>

<h2 id="communication">Cross Page Communication</h2>

<p>
You can communicate between your various pages using direct script calls,
similar to how frames can communicate.
The <code>$(ref:extension.getViews)</code> method returns a list of window objects for every active
page belonging to your extension, and the <code>$(ref:runtime.getBackgroundPage)</code>
method returns the event or persistent background page.
</p>

<p>
The following code snippet demonstrates how an event page can interact with
other pages in the extension and how to handle events such as user clicks.
</p>

<p>
This example extension has an event page and multiple pages created,
with tabs.create,
from a file named image.html.
</p>

<pre data-filename="background.js">
// React when a browser action's icon is clicked.
chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(tab) {
  var viewTabUrl = chrome.runtime.getURL('image.html');
  var imageUrl = <em>/* an image's URL */</em>;

  // Look through all the pages in this extension to find one we can use.
  var views = chrome.extension.getViews();
  for (var i = 0; i < views.length; i++) {
    var view = views[i];

    // If this view has the right URL and hasn't been used yet...
    if (view.location.href == viewTabUrl && !view.imageAlreadySet) {

      // ...call one of its functions and set a property.
      view.setImageUrl(imageUrl);
      view.imageAlreadySet = true;
      break; // we're done
    }
  }
});
</pre>
<pre data-filename="image.html">
&lt;html>
  &lt;script>
    function setImageUrl(url) {
      document.getElementById('target').src = url;
    }
  &lt;/script>

  &lt;body>
    &lt;p>
    Image here:
    &lt;/p>

    &lt;img id="target" src="white.png" width="640" height="480">

  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

<p>
If provided the correct permissions and registered in the manifest, you can call outside <a href="content_scripts">Content Scripts</a> as well:


<pre>
chrome.tabs.executeScript(null, {file: "content_script.js"});
</pre>
</p>
<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use event pages over persistent background pages whenever possible.

  <li>Keep necessary listeners at the top level scope of the event page.
      The event page is loaded once for each new version of your extension.
      After that, it will only load to deliver events you have registered for.

  <li>If you need to do some initialization when your extension is
      installed or upgraded, listen to the
      <code>$(ref:runtime.onInstalled)</code>
      event. This is a good place to register for
      <a href="declarativeWebRequest">declarativeWebRequest</a> rules,
      <a href="contextMenus">contextMenu</a> entries, and other such
      one-time initialization.

  <li>If you need to keep runtime state in memory throughout a browser
      session, use the <a href="storage">storage API</a> or
      IndexedDB. Since the event page does not stay loaded for long, you
      can no longer rely on global variables for runtime state.

      {{^is_apps}}
    <li>Use <a href="events#filtered">event filters</a> to restrict
      your event notifications to the cases you care about. For example, if
      you listen to the <code><a href="extensions/tabs#event-onUpdated">tabs.onUpdated</a></code>
      event, try using the
      <code>$(ref:webNavigation.onCompleted)</code>
      event with filters instead (the tabs API does not support filters).
      That way, your event page will only be loaded for events that
      interest you.
      {{/is_apps}}

  <li>Listen to the
        <code>$(ref:runtime.onSuspend)</code>
        event if you need to do last second cleanup before your event page
        is shut down. However, we recommend persisting periodically instead.
        That way if your extension crashes without receiving
        <code>onSuspend</code>, no data will typically be lost.

  <li>When using <a href="messaging">message passing</a>, close unused message ports.
      The event page will not shut down until all message ports are closed.

  <li>If you're using the <a href="contextMenus">context menus</a> API,
      pass a string <code>id</code> parameter to
      <code>$(ref:contextMenus.create)</code>,
      and use the
      <code>$(ref:contextMenus.onClicked)</code>
      callback instead of an <code>onclick</code> parameter to
      <code>$(ref:contextMenus.create)</code>.

  <li>Test that your event page works properly when it is unloaded and then reloaded,
      which only happens after several seconds of inactivity.
      Common mistakes include:
      <ul>
         <li>Executing work at page load time
           when it should only be done when the extension is installed.

	       <li>Setting an alarm at page load time, which resets any previous alarm.

         <li>Not adding event listeners at page load time.
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="transition">Convert persistent background page to event page</h2>

<p>
When converting an existing extension with a persistent background page to an event page, follow this checklist:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add <code>"persistent": false</code> to your manifest.

  <li>If your extension uses <code>window.setTimeout()</code>
      or <code>window.setInterval()</code>,
      switch to using the <a href="alarms">alarms API</a> instead.
      DOM-based timers won't be honored if the event page shuts down.

  <li>Asynchronous HTML5 APIs like notifications and geolocation
    will not complete if the event page shuts down.
    Instead, use equivalent extension APIs, like
    <a href="notifications">notifications</a>.

  <li>If your extension uses,
    <code>$(ref:extension.getBackgroundPage)</a></code>,
    switch to
    <code>$(ref:runtime.getBackgroundPage)</code>
    instead. The newer method is asynchronous so that it can start the event
    page if necessary before returning it.
</ol>
</p>
