<h1>Protect User Privacy</h1>

<p>
  Users will not use an extension if it compromises their privacy.
  Protect and respect extension users
  by taking the correct precautions to keep their identity safe.
</p>

<h2 id="required_permissions">Reduce Required Permissions</h2>

<p>
  What APIs an extension has access to
  is granted in the permissions field of the <a href="/manifest">manifest</a>.
  The more permissions granted,
  the more avenues an attacker has to intercept information.
</p>
<p>
  Only the APIs an extension depends on should be listed,
  and consideration should be given to less invasive options.
</p>
<h3 id="activeTab">activeTab</h3>
<p>
  Extensions using the <a href="/tabs"><code>tabs</code></a>
  API can often subsitute
  <a href="/activeTab"><code>activeTab</code></a> instead.
  The <code>activeTab</code>
  permission will grant an extension temporary access to
  the currently active tab,
  only when the user <i>invokes</i> the extension.
  Access is cut off when the user navigates away from or closes the current tab.
  It serves as an alternative for many uses of
  <code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code>.

</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  {
    "name": "Very Secure Extension",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "Example of a Secure Extension",
    <b>"permissions": ["activeTab"],</b>
    "manifest_version": 2
  }
</pre>
<p>
  The activeTab permission displays no warning messages durring installation.
</p>

<h2 id="optional_permissions">Opt for Optional Permissions</h2>
<p>
  Empower users to choose what features
  and permissions they need from an extension by including
  <a href="/permissions#manifest">optional permissions</a>.
  If a feature is not essential to the core functionality of an extension,
  make it optional
  and move the API or domain into the optional permissions field.
</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  {
    "name": "Very Secure Extension",
    ...
    <b>"optional_permissions": [ "tabs", "https://www.google.com/" ]</b>,
    ...
  }
</pre>
<p>
  Including option permissions allows an extension to explain why it needs a
  particular permission when the user enables the relevant feature.
  Updating extensions with optional permissions instead of required permissions
  will not disable the extension,
  it will only make the new feature available.
</p>
<h2 id="data_collection">Limit and Secure User Information</h2>
<p>
  Only request and use the minimum user infromation an extension needs.
  The less information an extension asks from a user
  means less exposure if the extension is compromised.
</p>
<p>
  Store and retrieve data in a secure server.
  Register the domain and use HTTPS to connect.
  Avoid keeping sensitive user data in the client side of an extension.
