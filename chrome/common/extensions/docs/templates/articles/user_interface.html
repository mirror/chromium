<h1>User Interface</h1>

<p>
  Extension user interface should be purposeful and minimal.
  Just like the extensions themselves,
  the UI should customize or enhance the browsing experience,
  not distract from it.
</p>

<p>
  While there are several different ways to implement a UI within an extension,
  only one or a few may be relevant to its functionality.
</p>

<h2 id="icons">Icons</h2>
<p>
  Extensions require at least one icon to represent it.
  For the best visual results,
  it should be provided as a png in at least the following sizes:
  <ul>
    <li>
      16x16 - this will be used as the favicon for the extensions pages
    </li>
    <li>
      32 x 32 - Windows computers often require this size.
      Providing this option will prevent size distortion when shrinking
      the 48 x 48 option.
    </li>
    <li>
      48 x 48 - displayed in the extension management page
    </li>
    <li>
      128 x 128 - used to display during installation and in the Chrome Web Store
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  They are registered in the manifest under the icons field:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  {
    ...
    "icons": {
      "16": "extension_icon16.png",
      "32": "extension_icon32.png",
      "48": "extension_icon48.png",
      "128": "extension_icon128.png"
    }
    ...
  }
</pre>

<p>
  Additional <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/images">images</a>
  such as screenshots and promotional material are provided
  when uploading to the developer dashboard,
  but these will not need to be registered in the manifest.
</p>

<h2 id="badge">Badge</h2>
<p>
  Badges display up to four characters on top of the browser icon.
  Use them to indicate the state of the extension.
  The
  <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples#search:drink">
  Drink Water Event</a> sample has no badge when there is not an alarm set,
  but shows "ON" to let the user know they haven't missed the notification.
</p>
<img src="{{static}}/images/user_interface/badge_off_example.png"
  width="72" height="72"
  alt="Badge Off" />
<img src="{{static}}/images/user_interface/badge_on_example.png"
  width="72" height="72"
  alt="Badge On" />
</p>
  Set the text of the badge by calling
  <a href="/browserAction#method-setBadgeText">
    <code>chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText</code>
  </a>
  and the background color by calling
  <a href="/browserAction#method-setBadgeBackgroundColor">
    <code>chrome.browserAction.setBadgeBackgroundColor</code>
  </a>.
</p>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
  chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText({text: 'ON'});
  chrome.browserAction.setBadgeBackgroundColor({color: "#4688F1"});
</pre>

<h2 id="action">Browser Action and Page Action</h2>

<p>
  Declare either browser_action or page_action in the manifest
  to specify how the extension icon is displayed.
</p>
<p>
  If the extension is only usable in certain situation, use page_action.
  Using page_action will grey out the toolbar icon
  when the extension is unusable.
</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  Example
</pre>
<p>
  Declare browser_action if the user can always interact with the extension
</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  Example
</pre>
<p>
  Register the browser toolbar icon under the chosen action.
  Multiple sizes are encourage to help scale for the 16-dip space.
  At minimum, 16x16 and 32x32 are recommended.
</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  Example
</pre>
<p>
  Any additional sizes are allowed, but ensure that all of your icons are square or they may be distorted.
</p>
