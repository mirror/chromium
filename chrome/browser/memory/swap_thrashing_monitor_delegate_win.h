// The Windows implementation of the delegate used by the swap thrashing
// monitor.
//
// The systems interested in observing the thrashing activity should ensure that
// the SampleAndCalculateSwapThrashingLevel function of this delegate gets
// called periodically as it is responsible for querying the state of the
// system. It is recommended to use a frequency around 0.5 and 1Hz.
//
// This delegate looks at a fixed number of past samples to determine if the
// system is now in a thrashing state. To do this it counts how many samples
// exceed a certain threshold.
