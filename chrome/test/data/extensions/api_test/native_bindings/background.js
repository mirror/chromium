// This is a good end-to-end test for two reasons. The first is obvious - it
// tests a simple API and makes sure it behaves as expected, as well as testing
// that other APIs are unavailable.
// The second is that chrome.test is itself an extension API, and a rather
// complex one. It requires both traditional bindings (renderer parses args,
// passes info to browser process, browser process does work and responds, re-
// enters JS) and custom JS bindings (in order to have our runTests, assert*
// methods, etc). If any of these stages failed, the test itself would also
// fail.

      // (not the API implementation), so as long as it's a possible response,
      // it's a success for our purposes.
