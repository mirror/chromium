      "message": "Hrm, so if I\u0027m following this route correctly, this FindCERT call is needed because  ClientCertStoreChromeOS::CertFilter takes an X509Certificate and needs to sniff at the NSS module or so associated with the CERTCertificate?\n\nThe other option would be if CertFilter took a CERTCertificate. That doesn\u0027t immediately work because it sees a ClientCertIdentity rather than the actual ClientCertIdentityNSS objects that ClientCertStoreNSS fills in. This seems like it should be resolvable, either by erasing the types a hair later or letting ClientCertStoreNSS::GetPlatformCertsOnWorkerThread see the filter.",
