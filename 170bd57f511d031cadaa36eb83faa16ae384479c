      "message": "As we discussed offline, destruction of KeyedServices happens in dependency order, just like shutdown does (and thus there is no risk that |signin_manager_| is already destroyed here). Per our offline discussion, I will change this to happen in shutdown as it seems like that\u0027s more in the spirit of KeyedServices, but I\u0027ll do that in a separate CL as it\u0027s orthogonal to this CL.",
