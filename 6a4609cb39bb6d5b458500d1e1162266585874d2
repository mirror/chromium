      "message": "If the only remaining usage of AccessTokenStore after this CL is to check whether it\u0027s null or not, would it reasonable to just eliminate those unittests as part of this CL, thus enabling removing the unused functionality in this CL as well?",

      "message": "Yep I could do that.\n\nThis falls into the category I was labeling a \u0027weird state\u0027, in this case: a unit of untested albeit unused, partially deconstructed (i.e. URLRequestContext parts excised) code.\n\nAnother option, I could almost-wholly deconstruct it, i.e. reduce AccessTokenStore to basically \"class AccessTokenStore() {};\". But using that as an of/off marker for NetworkLocationProvider is a \u0027weird state\u0027 in its own way.\n\nIn the end it\u0027s all for a short time, so happy to go with any of these really. What\u0027s your preference for review purposes?",

      "message": "OK, it makes sense for the removal of AccessTokenStore to be a \"clean removal\", i.e., it could be reverted to bring all the code back as it was. It\u0027s the end of my day now, so I\u0027ll review this CL on Monday (as-is). Apologies for the delay!",
