      "message": "Yep I could do that.\n\nThis falls into the category I was labeling a \u0027weird state\u0027, in this case: a unit of untested albeit unused, partially deconstructed (i.e. URLRequestContext parts excised) code.\n\nAnother option, I could almost-wholly deconstruct it, i.e. reduce AccessTokenStore to basically \"class AccessTokenStore() {};\". But using that as an of/off marker for NetworkLocationProvider is a \u0027weird state\u0027 in its own way.\n\nIn the end it\u0027s all for a short time, so happy to go with any of these really. What\u0027s your preference for review purposes?",
