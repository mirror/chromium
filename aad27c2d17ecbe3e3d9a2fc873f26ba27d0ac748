      "message": "I feel like these should have a subdir of contrib.\n\nThis is why I don\u0027t think we can only have contrib/arm and contrib/x86. Those two would rely on something like a third contrib/chunky.\n\nIt might be easiest to use contrib/chromium rather than contrib/chunky. That would allow us to have a place for other changes as well.\n\n\nI am okay with parts of contrib/arm depending on contrib/chromium. Not all parts will. It offers a bit of isolation if someone wants to not use the chunky bits, for example. But another option could be to just put everything in contrib/chromium.",
