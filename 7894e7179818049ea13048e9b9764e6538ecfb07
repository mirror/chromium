      "message": "Ah. I don\u0027t know what makes most sense as I don\u0027t know what the various flags trigger wrt to actually running tests. I just wanted to know if we actually considered the tests to be something we didn\u0027t want to fix. If Skip does the same as WontFix wrt to running tests and Skip is not deprecated or anything, skip sounds more correct, but I\u0027m fine with whatever.",
