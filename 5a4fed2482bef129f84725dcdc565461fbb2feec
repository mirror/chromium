Now the overflows of start and end collapsed border are cached; before crrev.com/c/515606 they were calculated during this function.\n2. The new line 906 was AddContentsVisualOverflow() before crrev.com/c/515606; Now collapsed border overflow should be treated as self visual overflow of the table because sometimes the table paints all collapsed borders (see LayoutTable::should_paint_all_collapsed_borders_).",
