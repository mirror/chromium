Have you double-checked that locally, so that we don\u0027t add an irrelevant histogram?\n\nAssuming that\u0027s true, in addition to comparing this histogram in the control vs treatment, it might be a good idea to compare this to some sort of total resource download time so we have an idea of its significance. Do you know if there\u0027s an appropriate histogram? If so, add it to this comment for easier future reference.",

      "message": "The connection time will be zero for those resources that use already opened sockets. So we should have roughly the same histogram count for the control and treatment but the treatment should have more zeros.\n\nFor the total resource download time we have Net.HttpJob.TotalTime* but it\u0027s reported for all completed HttpJobs. We could add a new histogram for the same subset of resources to allow direct comparison. WDYT?",

      "message": "I think just mentioning Net.HttpJob.TotalTime in this comment will be sufficient.\n\nWe just want an order-of-magnitude of how much pre-connection saves with respect to all network traffic, so I don\u0027t think we really get that much additional information by restricting the HttpJob.TotalTime to those that happen before FCP.  (I\u0027m assuming that those that don\u0027t require a network connection, ie, cached resources, won\u0027t contribute much to the total time anyway.)",
