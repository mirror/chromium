      "message": "Rather than have this catch an error, and then fire an event that the manager listens, and then have the manager re-show this, could we have the catch() update the error?\n\nSomething like:\n\nonRetryTap_: function() {\n  this.delegate.retryLoadUnpacked(this.loadError.retryGuid).then(() \u003d\u003e {\n    // The retry succeeded; our work here is done.\n    this.close();\n  }).catch(loadError \u003d\u003e {\n    // The retry failed; update the dialog.\n    this.loadError \u003d loadError;\n  });\n},\n\nWDYT?  Seems it\u0027d be simpler and more contained, and would prevent the \"dialog close -\u003e dialog open\" flicker that would happen otherwise.",

      "message": "When I played with this UI, I found that the \"flicker\" is actually signaling to the user that something happened and the same error occurred.\n\nClicking on \"retry\" without closing and re-opening the dialog seemed confusing as if nothing happened. I can re-examine and potentially post a video of the UX problem I am describing.",
