      "message": "Send some comments over email with screencasts. Repeating here for posterity:\n\nThe fade-out animation is affected by the dom-if changes (revealed if you set the animation speed set to 10% to make it very obvious).\n\nNote how the dom-if is applying display: none, before the fade-out has finished, which is undesirable.\n\nI am thinking that a better approach is to listen for the events dispatched by the view-manager (see [1]) when an view has been exited, and change the boolean at that time, instead of changing the boolean before switchView() has been called.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/resources/md_extensions/view_manager.js?sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr\u0026l\u003d69\n\nBasically the goal is that this optimization should not be causing any visual behavioral change.",
