      "message": "This will be a behavior change in some cases.  Right now it seems as though we always pass NO, but there are classes which override this method and take action if |inForeground| is YES.  That code was previously dormant, but now may get run.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to handle this.  I don\u0027t think there\u0027s an issue of correctness, but some of this code might be at risk of crashing?",

      "message": "I\u0027ve checked all the overrides that respect the value passed via \"inForeground:\". They use the flag consistently with what is done in the -tabModel:didChangeActiveTab:previousTab:atIndex: which is going to be called just after this one, so it should be safe to pass the correct value here.\n\nThere are located in:\n- browser_view_controller.mm\n- contextual_search_wrangler.mm\n- tab_strip_model.mm",
