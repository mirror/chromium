Right now it seems as though we always pass NO, but there are classes which override this method and take action if |inForeground| is YES.  That code was previously dormant, but now may get run.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to handle this.  I don\u0027t think there\u0027s an issue of correctness, but some of this code might be at risk of crashing?",
