      "message": "Done. As you suggest, the following would be sufficient in this case.\n.shortcut-card:last-of-type { ... }\n\nI initially added \"div\" and \"#container\" in an effort to make the subtleties of :last-of-type less subtle.\n\nAt first glance one would expect that \n.foo:last-of-type {...}\n\nwould match an element when\n1) Has the class \"foo\"\n2) Among children that have the class \"foo\", it\u0027s the last one.\n\nIn reality it matches when (example https://jsfiddle.net/r6j2h3ns/2/)\n1) Has the class \"foo\"\n2) Is the last child, among all children who have the same type, including the ones that don\u0027t have class \"foo\".\n\nI was hoping that \"#container \u003e div.shortcut-card:last-of-type {...}\"\nconveys this message a bit better, but maybe it caused more confusion, so removed.",
