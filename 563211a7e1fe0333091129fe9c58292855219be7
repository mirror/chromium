      "message": "hm, there\u0027s some inconsistency here. SetSnappedToLeft would be the correct name here to match SetMaximized above. That seems more correct as this is not a request to snap but an indication that window is already snapped, if I understand it correctly? It might be that wayland protocol used wrong name for \"maximize\" but maybe we should use \"set_snapped_to_left/right\" for this new protocol to not make the same mistake?",
