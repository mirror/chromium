      "message": "Ah yeah I agree with Scott.\nWe use const char* in tracing only to mark things that must be be long-lived strings (i.e. literals or leaked strings). This doesn\u0027t seem to be the case here (I guess it was and then somebody changed it to be a std::string).\nAlso given its simplicity I\u0027d probably make this an inline set_process_name(const std::string\u0026) accessor defined in the .h.\nThere are a dozen callers of SetProcessName, but given the mechanical nature of the change that would be TBR-able.",
