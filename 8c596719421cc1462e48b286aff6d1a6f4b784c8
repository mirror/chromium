      "message": "Eep, this suddenly got a lot more complicated.  I guess I wasn\u0027t expecting a class with lots of methods with my offhand suggestion or a new container in cc/base.  I was really thinking more along the lines of a typedef.\n\nI think I\u0027d almost prefer the previous solution than to have another container to understand, just in terms of increasing the complexity of cc.",

      "message": "I can make this an inner class of DiscardableImageMap? Wasn\u0027t sure if this needed to be in cc/base anyway.\n\nI do think having a class to encapsulate this functionality instead of having the vector iteration logic sprinkled over multiple places is better. May be limited places use it right now but not long before that changes. If you feel the extra code is still not worth it, happy to go back to plain old Region too.",
