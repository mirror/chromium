      "message": "I feel like it might be premature to start moving views browser dependencies into the release build on Mac until we can actually show a views browser -- otherwise it\u0027s extra bloat that we can\u0027t test, and it will be there for a number of releases. Maybe we need some other opinions on the \"badness\" of this (it\u0027s pretty high on my badness scale..). We still need a way to make progress on this though.\n\nMaybe the trick is a new compile-time flag. runtime_mac_views_browser or something. which implies mac_views_browser *and* Cocoa.\n\nThat comes with its own level of badness, but I think it is the lesser of the two. Assuming we can pull it off.",

      "message": "I think it should be an error to ever use this header on non-mac. This will force us to be diligent about how files are updated to use these flags. Which is a good thing -- we eventually want to tear this out, so dependencies in odd places will make that scary/churny.\n\nBut also any file that isn\u0027t *already* mac-specific, but wants to use these, should be a red-flag. The dependency is probably creeping in to the wrong place anyway.\n\nI think the best way to do that is to add a _mac suffix. And perhaps even add\n\n#if !defined(OS_MACOSX)\n#error \"This header shouldn\u0027t be used outside of Mac\".\n#endif\n\nor just guard the visibility of the contents of the file (i.e. still allow an #include but don\u0027t expose any symbols -- this way it\u0027s not necessary to #ifdef around the #include)",
