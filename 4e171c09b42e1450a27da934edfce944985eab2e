I understand that it\u0027s difficult to modify generate_conditiona_features.py to pass around the snake-case-generated-file but I guess modifying bindings scripts a bit reliable?",

      "message": "You\u0027re right, applying to_snake_case() in bindings scripts is more reliable, and we don\u0027t need fragile special handling like this. I confirmed all updated basenames in bindings/scripts/*.py are for #includes, so we can apply to_snake_case in normalize_and_sort_includes().\n\nMy concern was that we should not rewrite generated header files other than V8*.h, such as OriginTrials.h and RuntimeEnabledFeatures.h. move_blink_source.py won\u0027t rename them.\n\nI changed my mind so that bindings code modifies header basenames at runtime, and we hard-code exceptions for OriginTrials.h and RuntimeEnabledFeatures.h.  Also, we should snake them before the great mv and remove the exceptions.",
