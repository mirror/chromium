      "message": "We can\u0027t randomly remove a ticker without corrupting the indices of the rest, we should either only remove all of them or change the tickers array to be nullable pointers so that we can delete without removing from the array.\n\nDoes this happen? Do we need to remove random tickers from the array?",

      "message": "RemoveTicker was useful because I was thinking of adding support for add/remove tickers on the fly. Given that we probably won\u0027t need this feature, I\u0027ve taken it out so that we will never remove tickers from player_impl. Rather, we create new player if necessary and push properties to its corresponding new player_impl.",
