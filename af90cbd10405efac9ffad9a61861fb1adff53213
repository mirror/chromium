      "message": "Just to be sure, this doesn\u0027t intend to measure top-layer usage by modal \u003cdialog\u003e correct? As that issue points out, some of the complexity about top-layer is for multiple fullscreen elements and/or multiple modal dialogs . I don\u0027t believe modal dialogs come to this function (but i haven\u0027t been following code changes). \n\nI just want to ensure we understand what the use counter is measuring when making decisions about whether to remove nested support.",
