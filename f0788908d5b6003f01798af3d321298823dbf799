      "message": "I think that we could keep the code clean with overloaded operators.\n\nSo we\u0027d have class TracedValue\u003cT\u003e with overloaded assignment, conversion and comparision operators, which means that we could simply say TracedValue\u003cbool, kTracingCategoryNameDefault\u003e audio_playing and use it like a bool in the code (audio_playing \u003d true and such).\n\nAlso I don\u0027t think that having a subclass for each new value is a good idea. Why can\u0027t we just pass all required parameters (tracing name and a function to convert the value T to const char*) to the constructor?",

      "message": "I think this proliferation of classes is a little unfortunate. Could we not use a template instead so that we can keep the enum definitions etc. here where they belong rather than moving them to a tracing support file? A template would also make the underlying type obvious so there\u0027s no need to add comments like you\u0027ve done.",
