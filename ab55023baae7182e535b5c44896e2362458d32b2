      "message": "I\u0027m  squinting trying to understand if this is still applicable with visual rects. Since we would only rasterize ops that intersect the visual rect anyway so skia might not even see the op that we try to send? Sorry, I know I wrote this but memory fails.\n\nShould we have a test where we try to rasterize content where only an edge of the tile touches the visual rect that has the image? I would expect that the image is discovered but the op is never drawn with this, no?",
