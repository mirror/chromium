Since we would only rasterize ops that intersect the visual rect anyway so skia might not even see the op that we try to send? Sorry, I know I wrote this but memory fails.\n\nShould we have a test where we try to rasterize content where only an edge of the tile touches the visual rect that has the image? I would expect that the image is discovered but the op is never drawn with this, no?",
