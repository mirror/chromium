It suggests to me that the API is not intuitive.\n\nI added a comment on the design doc requesting a cleanup pass to make the proposal more readable and will consider the proposal more carefully once that is done.\n\nIn general I agree with oshima\u0027s comment that we should consider how the API will be used first and the implementation second.\n\nMy first thought is that we should use a MirrorMode enum, { none, all, mixed } instead of two booleans.",
