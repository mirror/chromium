      "message": "When the bar is configured to be at the top, then it should consume the scroll *before* and *instead* of the normal root layer scroll (leaving the remaining delta if any to scroll the root layer).  It looks like your code is only correct for bottom controls.  You can set \"Chrome Home\" to false in chrome://flags (or disable the flag in the code) for testing this case.",

      "message": "I tested both top and bottom controls. It seems both cases work fine.\n\nIf there is potential of buggy behavior because of this, how must I change this code? Just move this code before line 211 (i.e., the normal root layer scroll)?",
