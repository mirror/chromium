It looks like your code is only correct for bottom controls.  You can set \"Chrome Home\" to false in chrome://flags (or disable the flag in the code) for testing this case.",

That could be problematic for consuming delta since the controls won\u0027t cross the hide/show threshold so they might be snapping on each tick between half shown without actually changing state. If it\u0027s not and the default line size is big enough then this isn\u0027t an issue.",
