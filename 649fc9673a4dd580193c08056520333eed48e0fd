      "message": "IIUC this will effectively hide the focus affordance after a toggle button is triggered by any non-keyboard event, even though the button still has focus?  Personally I\u0027m not a fan of that because presumably an \u003center\u003e or \u003cspace\u003e keystroke will still activate the toggle action.  Do you know if design or accessibility have input here?\n\nSimilarly, if a ToggleButton has focus and a user clicks or taps on it they won\u0027t see any change.\n\nWould a circle shaped InkDropHighlight, shown only on focus, be a viable solution to both concerns here?",
