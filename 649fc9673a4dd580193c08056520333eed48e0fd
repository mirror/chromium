      "message": "IIUC this will effectively hide the focus affordance after a toggle button is triggered by any non-keyboard event, even though the button still has focus?  Personally I\u0027m not a fan of that because presumably an \u003center\u003e or \u003cspace\u003e keystroke will still activate the toggle action.  Do you know if design or accessibility have input here?\n\nSimilarly, if a ToggleButton has focus and a user clicks or taps on it they won\u0027t see any change.\n\nWould a circle shaped InkDropHighlight, shown only on focus, be a viable solution to both concerns here?",

      "message": "To your first point, yes. And that\u0027s pretty normal behavior --- we typically don\u0027t show focus indicators when someone is using the mouse to interact. And this matches paper-toggle-button. All that said, I consider this a corner case.\n\n\u003e Similarly, if a ToggleButton has focus and a user clicks or taps on it they won\u0027t see any change.\n\nnot so, as a \"tap\" implies a completed tap (down and up). Thus the glow would disperse at the end of the tap. Once again this matches paper-toggle-button.\n\n\u003e ...Highlight...\n\nNo, I don\u0027t think so because it doesn\u0027t easily give us the same nice animations when it comes and goes. It would just fade out instead of bursting.",
