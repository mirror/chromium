      "message": "If we receive a GetAll() when load state is KEYS_ONLY, then it posts a task to load map. This would cause a load on keys-values-map and clear the keys-only-map, which should set map_state to unloaded while this is happening.\nI wanted to make this behavior more explicit by stating that a reload is required if there are load tasks. If you prefer you can make this a dcheck here, but I would like anyone changing this code to be aware of this. So, had this comment here.\nmaybe:\nDCHECK(map_state \u003d\u003d INVALID || on_load_complete_tasks_.empty()) in this function?",
