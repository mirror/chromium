      "message": "Though there is a very limited UI path to reach here, I\u0027m a a bit cautious about switching to the original profile from the OTR profile because it\u0027s hard to notice for users. If the launched app uses webview, some user may continue browsing without noticing he/she is now out of the OTR mode. Instead of switching to the original profile, is there any possibility that we can fix the extension API so that it works with OTR profile?",

      "message": "The extension API is not the main problem here. Off the record platform apps are not well supported (off the record window is really a Chrome browser feature).\nMainly, an app window existence will not keep the off the record profile alive after all incognito browser windows are closed, but there are other issues too. For example, there is no separate app window registry for OTR app windows (the registry keyed service redirects to the original profile), there is no UI for launching platform apps in incognito, the user does not have any indication whether a platform app window is running in an incognito profile or not.\n\n+benwells, in case he can offer additional insight",

Could you double check with chromeos-privacy@ if it\u0027s OK to switch to the normal profile app from the OTF profile-browser? After getting the answer from the privacy team, LGTM.",
