      "message": "I agree this is confusing, but considering the usage scenario at hands (i.e. diagnosing a telemetry connection), it\u0027s more useful to know that the previous commands are not executed because of pending navigation rather than having some process killed. Should we perhaps introduce a flag that would cancel pending navigation? Or some return result that indicated what was done?",
