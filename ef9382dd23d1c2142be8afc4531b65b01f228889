      "message": "All in product help triggering logic for feature promos are triggered through user action. That seems to me that the browser must be active at that time. If a browser is minimized, the browser is not active nor will it show a promo.\n\nI.e. click on omnibox -\u003e show new tab promo\nclear browsing data history -\u003e show incognito window promo\n\nFeature trackers are per profile I believe, unless I misunderstood something during the implementation.",

I can technically get the browser from the LocationBarView that the OmniboxViewViews contain: \nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/ui/views/location_bar/location_bar_view.h?l\u003d356 However, that means adding a method get_browser into the location_bar_view. Would that be okay?\n\nI presume for the incognito window tracker, I will also need to do something along those lines from the clear browsing data handler which invokes the tracker.",
