      "message": "I noticed that you used Member here rather than TraceWrapperMember. Just want to make sure this is the intended behavior - there\u0027s no problem otherwise.\n\nFYI (I had to double check I remembered this correctly), the distinction is that using Member, expando properties on the XRDevice can be lost, if you do, e.g.:\n{\n  let xrdevice \u003d createXRDevice(); // or whatever\n  xrdevice.foo \u003d \"bar\";\n  gl.setCompatibleXRDevice(xrdevice);\n}\n// ... some time later, garbage is collected, and then\ngl.getContextAttributes().compatibleXRDevice.foo; // might be undefined because the wrapper was garbage collected.\n\nThis behavior should be testable using --js-flags\u003d--expose-gc + window.gc(), if you want to test it (we do this in the WebGL CTS).",
