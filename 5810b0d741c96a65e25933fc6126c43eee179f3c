      "message": "this is the only logic change in this cl. The reason this is needed is because the NavigateTo call for initiated_test.html now happens quite a bit later than earlier (i.e. before it was in PaymentRequestBrowserTestBase::SetUpOnMainThread) while now it\u0027s after the browser test harness posts a task to the browser main loop. The order of line 400 and 401 didn\u0027t make a difference in the expected output, so I put it there since I thought it improved readability (i.e. since the histogramtester ended up capturing events from that navigate).",
