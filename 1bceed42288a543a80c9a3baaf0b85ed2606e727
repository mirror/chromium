      "message": "I think this is a fine API, but in trying to evaluate the API I did a bit of brainstorming about what other APIs would look like, specifically around the backoff/delay that you mention, and I wanted to share that just FYI.\n\nFirst of all, I\u0027m a pretty strong believer in not putting in interface methods unless there\u0027s an identified consumer for them.  I presume the consumers for this are in the space of URLFetcher consumers, but I don\u0027t know that space well.  If that space is covered by max_retries \u0026 retry_mode, feel absolutely free to stop reading now.\n\nIf it isn\u0027t, I find myself wondering about an alternative interface, which is a callback that takes an enum k5XX, kNetworkChanged + number of tries so far, and returns a bool (try again/don\u0027t) and a delay until the trying again should happen.  That interface seems only a bit more complex than this one, but allows for semi-arbitrary backoff/delay semantics.",

      "message": "The the extent of my knowledge, it\u0027s only the print service that delays retries...So the question is:  Are other consumers all interested in doing their own (arbitrary) backoff, should we implement some sort of standard backoff, or should we implement no backoff, and let the consumers do that themselves, if they really want to.\n\nIf we want to leave it in the hands of consumers, I think your suggestion makes a lot of sense.",

      "message": "This CL is big enough that I don\u0027t want to make it any more complicated.  I\u0027m concerned about backoff APIs in that what consumers enable how many retries in what cases already seems completely random.  Allowing them more power results in even more completely random bifurcation of settings (If these were informed, I\u0027d have less concern here, but I don\u0027t think the consumers that use 3 vs 5 vs 1 retry, for one reason of the other, are at all informed).\n\nI think we should just implement sane default behavior, and if the consumer wants something else, they can implement it themselves.  This allows us to support retry-after (And *only* retry after) on 5xx, and maybe implement some sort of semi-principled delay on network changes (Though we could probably do best there if we had access to the network change monitoring stuff, not sure if hooking up to that is worth the effort).\n\nWDYT?",
