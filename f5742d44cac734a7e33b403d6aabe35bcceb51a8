It doesn\u0027t seem to be the common practice - normally WebTaskRunners are passed via pointers (and code style discourages the use of non-const references).\n\nI\u0027d personally vote for const scoped_refptr\u003cWebTaskRunner\u003e\u0026 task_runner as an argument. Kentaro-san, Taiju-san, WDYT?",
