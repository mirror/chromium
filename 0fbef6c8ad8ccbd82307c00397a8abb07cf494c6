It would be nice if the browser knew in some way what IDs were associated with the thing on the other end of the mojo pipe without relying on the embedded content to supply them.",

      "message": "We can check* v8_execution_context_id is from a \"valid\" range (quotes used because the id came from the renderer in the first place, via devtools).  Unfortunately it looks like mojo doesn\u0027t tell us anything about the sender so I don\u0027t think we can assert v8_execution_context_id belongs to the renderer sending the message.\n\n* This class is only used by C++ embedders of headless_lib so crashing seems the right thing to do.",
