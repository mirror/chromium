      "message": "So, off-hand it seems you\u0027re recalculating the styles for descendants only if `LayoutObjectIsNeeded` returns true, is that right?\n\nIf so, this is wrong in presence of `display: contents`, because descendants of `display: contents` elements still need their style up to date even though the element doesn\u0027t need a layout object.\n\nSo I think the check here needs to change to something like `LayoutObjectIsNeeded || IsDisplayContents`.",
