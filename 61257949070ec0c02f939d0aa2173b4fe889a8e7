Removing the SetupCrossSiteRedirector also didn\u0027t work.\n\nDid you use the EmbeddedTestServer in //chrome or //content? My browser test code here is very similar to:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/payments/site_per_process_payments_browsertest.cc?l\u003d40-72\nexcept it is in //chrome, but my browser test code is in //content.
