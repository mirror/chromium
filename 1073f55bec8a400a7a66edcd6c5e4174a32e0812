I\u0027m wondering if we should have something like USE_FEATURE_ENGAGEMENT (in the vein of other USE_ flags) instead?\n\nAlso, I assume you changed the definition here so as to exclude iOS?  I\u0027m not really sure of the purpose of the change if it\u0027s not that.",

      "message": "I changed it to exclude the MACOS but also changed it because I was told in a previous comment to keep it the same as the other files. Previously the check was \"if defined (OS_WIN) || defined(OS_LINUX)\" however the promos are not included in CHROMEOS which led to the current change which also affected all other files to be changed similarly.\n\ni.e. feature_constants.h \nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/614367/18/components/feature_engagement/public/feature_constants.h\n\nI wouldn\u0027t mind using having a USE_flag as it would probably be more intuitive to people reading it. Would you mind pointing to me where I would define this flag?",
