      "message": "I tried to explain it in my first message:\n\n\u003e These tests were not there to enforce chromium to meet a specification, but to document the current behavior (which looked strange to me). This behavior has changed after this patch, form re-submissions are no more blocked.\n\u003e The reason I can\u0027t adapt these tests is that a non-blocked form re-submission needs the user to manually approve the navigation and I can\u0027t do it using a LayoutTest.\n\nSo the reason is that in the LayoutTest, I can\u0027t click on \"OK\" (in the new dialog that appeared) to approve the form re-submission.",
