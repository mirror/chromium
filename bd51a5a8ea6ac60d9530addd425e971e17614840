      "message": "There are settings-dropdown-menu instances that don\u0027t have a label next to them, and will be pushed down unnecessarily, see http://imgur.com/a/fQlIr.\n\nThe more I look at this problem the more I think that the best way to address this bug is to add a margin on the specific md-select instances you care about (Clear browsing data?).  Also in the bug there is a screenshot of the \"Page zoom\" select not being aligned with the label, but:\n\n1) page zoom select is not a settings-dropdown-menu, so this CL does not affect it.\n2) Can a user tell that the text is slightly misaligned without drawing a line (see http://imgur.com/a/2ef4N)? The distance between the select and the label is sufficiently long where I don\u0027t think a 1px misalignment matters as much.\n\nAlso the proposed solution \"fixes\" the issue assuming that the label only takes up one line (which might not be the case everywhere for all languages).",

      "message": "Tried this change locally. I think we should add a \"height: 0\" within the .md-select-underline {} block below. The underline should have just 1px height (because of the border). Not sure why it has 2px height + 1px border currently.\n\nThen margin-top should be 2px instead of 4px (but also see other comment suggesting that margin-top should be added elsewhere).",

      "message": "the additional 2px come from the focus underline (md-select-underline::after) but setting \"height: 0\" works and the focus underline is still in the same position. This already reduces the misalignment. Thanks!",
