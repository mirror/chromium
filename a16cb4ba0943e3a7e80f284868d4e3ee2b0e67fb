Instead of testing the iframe\u0027s controller (which I expect several other tests already do), can we just add a TODO to test the shared worker\u0027s controller)?\n\nor if there is already a test for shared worker\u0027s controller, we don\u0027t need to check controller in this file and just test fetch() instead",
