How would you feel about having service fire these events when it received them, and then adding listeners for \u0027profile-state-changed\u0027 and such here?",

      "message": "Service is not an HTMLElement, so in order to fire its own events it would have to either\n\n1) inherit from cr.ui.EventTarget, see [1] or,\n2) contain a service.eventTarget member variable\n\nI was trying to avoid that, since it just seems it is adding an additional level of indirection (C++ event fired -\u003e Service handles C++ event -\u003e Service re-fires DOM event -\u003e Manager handles DOM event) and additional JS code to be executed.\n\nAlso DOM events seem more heavy-weight than necessary for Service-\u003eManager communication. DOM events have bubbling/capturing/preventDefault/stopPropagation mechanisms which only make sense when propagating events within a DOM tree.\n\n\u003e in order to avoid adding additional dependencies on the API\n\nDo you mean avoid additional methods on the API like getXXXTarget()? Personally I don\u0027t mind the extra method, especially since a FakeChromeEvent implementation already exists (see [2]) and I am already leveraging this during tests.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/webui/resources/js/cr/event_target.js\n[2] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/test/data/webui/fake_chrome_event.js",
