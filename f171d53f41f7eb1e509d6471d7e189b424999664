      "message": "I\u0027d slightly prefer that we be able to use DOM-style events rather than extension API events for manager in order to avoid adding additional dependencies on the API and also to be able to leverage regular web testing tools.  How would you feel about having service fire these events when it received them, and then adding listeners for \u0027profile-state-changed\u0027 and such here?",
