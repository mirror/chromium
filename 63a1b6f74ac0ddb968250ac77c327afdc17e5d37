      "message": "The comment here claims that this should check for an existing host running with the same configuration. However, get_daemon_proc only checks whether there is an existing host running under the same user. If the former is the intention, this should be fixed in a future CL. If the latter is the intention, I\u0027ll move this check up to before launching user-session.",

I can\u0027t think of any reason to limit users to one desktop, so perhaps we can just remove the check altogether? I don\u0027t remember why it was important.",
