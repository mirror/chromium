      "message": "This is probably off by subpixel accumulation. Here is my train of thoughts:\n--\u003e The cull rect came from the intersection of GraphicsLayer bounds and clip rects computed by PaintLayerClipper. Both of them are computed relative to snapped border box location.\n--\u003e In SPv175, paint offset is relative to the transform node.\n--\u003e In SPv175, we want the cull rect to be relative to the transform node as well.\n--\u003e Therefore, cull rect should be adjusted by the snapped border box location relative to its transform node, which is object_paint_offset - subpixel_accumulation, or simply PixelSnappedIntPoint(object_paint_offset). (Always equivalent probably?)\n\nIt is also questionable to only adjust for layers that has owned or grouped backing. For descendant layers the cull rect is relative to painting_info.root_layer\u0027s snapped border box, which is not necessarily equal to the transform node.\n\nI think maybe the right thing to do is to always\nnew_cull_rect.MoveBy(PixelSnappedIntPoint(painting_info.root_layer-\u003eGetLayoutObject().PaintOffset()));\n\nDoes it sound right to you?",
