      "message": "I don\u0027t have any strong recollection why we didn\u0027t move to ratios (I know that I wasn\u0027t terribly convinced we ever needed to make that change, but we\u0027re past that decision now).  I think is likely my place of concern.  As soon as we start using a mixture of ratio and PIX then it seems like we are more likely to have an off by one error.  I think if we want to move to ratio, we need to remove the top_shown_pix and bottom_shown_pix being sent out.\n\nI think we\u0027d want to store both the ratio and height in this class instead of just the prev_*_shown_pix_ var.  Then I think we\u0027d need to start sending up the ratio and size in PX of the various controls to let the final position be in charge of doing the final calculation.",
