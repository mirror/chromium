      "message": "I don\u0027t have any strong recollection why we didn\u0027t move to ratios (I know that I wasn\u0027t terribly convinced we ever needed to make that change, but we\u0027re past that decision now).  I think is likely my place of concern.  As soon as we start using a mixture of ratio and PIX then it seems like we are more likely to have an off by one error.  I think if we want to move to ratio, we need to remove the top_shown_pix and bottom_shown_pix being sent out.\n\nI think we\u0027d want to store both the ratio and height in this class instead of just the prev_*_shown_pix_ var.  Then I think we\u0027d need to start sending up the ratio and size in PX of the various controls to let the final position be in charge of doing the final calculation.",

      "message": "The thing I\u0027m most worried about breaking is IsUseZoomForDSFEnabled(), as I don\u0027t really understand how it works. If I turn on UseZoomForDSF, and intentionally set the wrong dip scale, everything appears to work correctly anyways, so I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on there.\n\nIn order to handle the density mismatch, I could send up the ratio and the size in dips. Does that sound reasonable? Otherwise I\u0027d have to make the fullscreen manager aware of both the java UI dip scale and web content dip scale.",
