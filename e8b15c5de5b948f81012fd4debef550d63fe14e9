      "message": "*Optional*: One thing I found hard to grok about the NCN Android is that the initialization is done in different places and needs to be in a specific order.\n\nMaybe we could add a note here or in the header file?\n\nFor instance, even though we do Java_NetworkChangeNotifier_init() here, the initialization of the global java singleton is actually done earlier than this. The init() just returns us a pointer to the Java object that we then use. The AutoDetect is also expected to be initialized with the appropriate policy for |register_network_callback_failed_| to be meaningful.",
