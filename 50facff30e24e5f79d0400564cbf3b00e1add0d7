As is, your probably mostly measuring network stuff (on top of any deferred loading time from my other comment).",

      "message": "Looking at the paths from HTMLme, it looks like this can be executed both in response to setting a \u003csource\u003e as well as things like playing. And then there are cases where the load is deferred. Basically, are you confident that you\u0027re measuring what you think you\u0027re measuring? Do you want to add bits to take into account the path to load (e.g. was deferred? was triggered by play()?)? \n\nAlso, for MSE, it looks like this will fire as soon as they set a blob URL which may be distant from the time they start appending media.",
