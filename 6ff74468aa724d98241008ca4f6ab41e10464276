      "message": "Does it make sense to pass PositionWithAffinity to AdjustPositionForMapping(), so that we can also handle block-anchored positions?\n\nFor example, if we have\n\n\u003cdiv id\u003dcontainer\u003e\n  foo\n  \u003cdiv id\u003dchild\u003ebar\u003c/div\u003e\n  baz\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n(#child@BeforeAnchor, upstream) should be adjusted to \"foo\"@3\n(#child@AfterAnchor, downstream) should be adjusted to \"bar\"@0\n\nIn fact I\u0027d like to add the entire logic into offset mapping so that it can also handle block-anchored positions by adjusting them to the correct inline. WDYT?\n\nBtw, it seems tricky when there are empty blocks. Seems that we should skip them during adjustion.",
