      "message": "Mostly my previous comment here was that this was inconsistent.  It was treating the pixmap size as a size_t here but checking it fit in a uint32_t later during serialization.\n\nI was wondering what we did elsewhere in Chrome.  I did some digging, and I found: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/child/blink_platform_impl.cc?q\u003dMaxDecodedImageBytes\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr\u003dCSs\u0026l\u003d681\n\nIt seems like we do support up to size_t on non-Android platforms.",
