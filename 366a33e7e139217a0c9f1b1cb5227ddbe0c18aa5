      "message": "The new baselines are created by \u0027run-webkit-tests --additional... --new-flag-specific-baseline\u0027 which won\u0027t create new baseline for results matching non-flag-specific baselines.\n\nThis one differs from the non-spv2 baseline at line 10 and line 15 (you can see it from the try result of the previous patch set here: http://build.chromium.org/p/tryserver.chromium.linux/builders/linux_layout_tests_slimming_paint_v2/builds/5448). The difference is because we use the display item clients found in the display items for spv2.\n\n(However, we will have spv2 baselines same as the non-spv2 baselines, in the following process:\n1. we create a new spv2 baseline which is different from the non-spv2 baseline;\n2. then some code change causes spv2 create the same baseline as non-spv2 for the test, and we rebaseline for spv2.\nThis can be avoided by optimizing results of above step 2, but the duplicated baselines seem not a big deal in this case which seems rare.)",
