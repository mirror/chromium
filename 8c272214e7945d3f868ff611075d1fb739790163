      "message": "Mark, on ios-chrome-passkit design doc you said that it\u0027s OK to have dependencies on InfoBarManager, InfoBarManagerImpl and SimpleAlertInfoBarDelegate:\nhttps://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1ww4AGMXxgGc25l1VIZkTPblJWrRe4kStGzDHmHtFCpo/edit?disco\u003dAAAABbPXWH8\n\nbut you also said that coordinator should delegate infobar presentation to BVC:\nhttps://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1ww4AGMXxgGc25l1VIZkTPblJWrRe4kStGzDHmHtFCpo/edit?disco\u003dAAAABbPXWIw\n\nI think if we have to choose between 2 bad options (add code to BVC, or present infobar in coordinator), I would go with presenting the infobar in the coordinator. This is because I believe that bloated BVC is a bigger problem, than coordinators dependency on infobar code. But I don\u0027t have a strong opinion, so please let me know if you prefer the delegation for presenting the infobar.",
