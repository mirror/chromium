Unless that could actually happen, I would just set bluetoothToggleDisabled_ to \u0027false\u0027 here to be more clear.\n\nadapterState_.available being false means it\u0027s a bug in bluez and/or below layers, and when it happens it can happen anytime randomly. I restore the Disabled property to adapterState_.available because I can\u0027t trust that the adapter is always healthy even after success callback.
