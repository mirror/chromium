It seems to suggest that there\u0027s a different algorithm applied but really it\u0027s the same logic with just the classes inverted.\n\nHow about:\n\n- if |text_is_search_query| is true, applies the same logic, but uses NONE for the matching text and MATCH for the non-matching text. This is done to mimic the behavior of SearchProvider which decorates matches according to the approach used by Google Suggest.",
