There\u0027s a good amount of work there just to bring (only) the IO thread up sooner so that can happen. \n\nThis now adds yet another ordering dependency on another part of the browser before we can bring up Service Manager, which seems like a clear step in the wrong direction.",

      "message": "Hmm, if we need to specify the task runner for an embedded service during the initialization of ServiceManagerContext (as is currently the case), then I don\u0027t see any alternative to passing it into this initialization call.\n\nIMO, this dependency on \"another part of the browser\" is not a big one. If you look at [1], all that is needed is to create an instance of AudioThreadImpl, which is essentially just a base::Thread. If creating that before the initialization of ServiceManagerContext would cause any issues, we would probably have to allow configuration of the task runner for embedded services in a stage _after_ the initialization of ServiceManagerContext. But I don\u0027t currently see any issue with creating the AudioThreadImpl first.\n\n[1] https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/759412/10/content/browser/browser_main_loop.cc",
