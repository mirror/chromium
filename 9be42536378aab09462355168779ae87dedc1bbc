      "message": "This is likely adding some amount of overdraw. Can you try running with --show-overdraw-feedback and see how much overdraw there is? If there is overdraw, then that can affect the frame rate during the animation quite a bit, and you would end up with a janky affect. Consider using a ui::AnimationMetricsReporter [1] (or something similar) to measure the frame-rate during animation. See its various uses for measuring animation smoothness for overdraw mode [2].\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/compositor/layer_animation_element.h?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d29\n[2] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ash/wm/overview/scoped_overview_animation_settings.h?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d26",
