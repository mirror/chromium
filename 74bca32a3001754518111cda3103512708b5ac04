      "message": "I\u0027m not sure this is really \"layout unit * 1.5\".  It seems like the desire here was for text or controls to have the same apparent whitespace above them.  The text has more \"built-in\" whitespace in the form of the internal leading (and maybe the cap height minus the x-height).  I imagine, then, that the whitespace here is \"text content to buttons, plus that built-in whitespace\", and the latter is ~8 DIP by default.  So maybe this is \"+ 8\" instead of \"* 1.5\"?\n\nIt seems like we could go further to try and dynamically calculate all this, but ugh.",

      "message": "I dunno, these values feel fairly arbitrary to me. I do think they\u0027re compensating for the text\u0027s internal leading, but that leading isn\u0027t 8pt. Even if it was that would mean the text versions should have 8pt *subtracted*, rather than the other way. But that makes them even harder to relate back to the layout unit.\n\nOn the other hand, the spec has us using the control version for checkboxes, which also have some internal padding.\n\nIn terms of dynamic calculation, that seems way out of scope for phase 1 at this point. And for phase 2 hopefully the \"margin combining\" idea you were talking about will make this less necessary.",

      "message": "Internal leading + (cap height - x-height) is about 8.\n\nAdding to controls or subtracting from text both produce equal results between text and controls, they just produce different results.  Presumably, Alan wants the larger value.\n\nUsing the control version for checkboxes seems likely wrong.  I\u0027d explicitly ask Alan about that.  I bet he\u0027d prefer the visuals of treating those like text.\n\nI agree that dynamic calculation is gross.  In the end, I think I\u0027m spending too much time concerned about this.  Hopefully by the time we\u0027d try to change the layout unit (which is the only case where \"* 1.5\" vs. \"+ 8\" would matter), we\u0027ll have nuked this.\n\nDo whatever seems wise.",
