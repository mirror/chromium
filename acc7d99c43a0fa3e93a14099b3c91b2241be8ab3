      "message": "This is an awkward indirection through PaintRecord just to write an SkPicture into some backing printing context.\n\nI assume that this is all getting drawn into some top level SkiaPaintCanvas / SkCanvas? GraphicsContext itself already has some Printing() boolean.  As an alternate suggestion, could you just store this SkCanvas on the context (possibly as a part of setting Printing to true?) and then just draw your placeholder into it directly?",
