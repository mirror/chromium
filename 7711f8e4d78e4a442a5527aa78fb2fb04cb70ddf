      "message": "As I\u0027m mentioned multiple times offline. I think GMB is the wrong level to do this. Dummy GMB \u003c-\u003e protected GMB mapping only works on one chrome platform, Ozone. And only with one Ozone implementation Ozone-DRM. To avoid unnecessary maintenance burden and keep it simple to understand it should ideally be done at the Ozone-DRM level. By introducing it at the GMB level we\u0027re making two abstraction levels above what is needed aware of it. I\u0027d like this to at least be moved back to the NativePixmap abstraction level as ProtectedNativePixmapManager. I thought that was what we agreed on? and not clear why the plan changed.",
