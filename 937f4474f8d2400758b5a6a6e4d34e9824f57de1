      "message": "This is interesting. Eventually, I would like to update UiRenderer so that we can make one call to Draw and pass in \"platform graphics utils\" that could vend out frames in a platform-specific way. Do you think this could be generalized for that purpose? Please ping me in the likely event that I\u0027ve been unclear :)",

      "message": "This, I believe, duplicates a bit of what cjgrant is working on.\n\nI don\u0027t think this is a big problem for now, and would be ameliorated by making a pixel test fixture. This would let you write a new TEST_F using the fixture for each pixel-testable scenario. I presume that the fixture will expose two functions for \"set things up so that I can configure the scene\" and \"now that I\u0027ve configured the scene, please render\", allowing the test author to concentrate on the middle bit: setting up the scene.",
