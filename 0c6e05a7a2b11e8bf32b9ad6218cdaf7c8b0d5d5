      "message": "I think we need to return here unless it\u0027s INSTALLED.\nAnyway, do you know when it\u0027s INSTALLED here? I guess if skipWaiting is called in e.waitUntil() for the install event handler, |status_| should be INSTALLING. If it\u0027s INSTALLED, that probably means skipWaiting was called in the install event handler directly without using waitUntil().\nIs that case still valid?",
