I guess if skipWaiting is called in e.waitUntil() for the install event handler, |status_| should be INSTALLING. If it\u0027s INSTALLED, that probably means skipWaiting was called in the install event handler directly without using waitUntil().\nIs that case still valid?",

This is the reason that we need deal with the INSTALLED case here.\n\nHowever, for the sample in this issue #725616：\n----\noninstall \u003d function() {\n    console.log(\u0027install\u0027);\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        self.skipWaiting()\n          .then(function() {\n              console.log(\u0027skipWaiting resolved\u0027);\n            });\n      }, 0);\n  };\n----\n\nＩ am thinking the result can NOT be: \"install\"-\u003e\"skipWaiting resolved\"-\u003e\"activate\", because what setTimeout does is add a new event to the browser event queue and the rendering engine is already in that queue, so it gets executed before the setTimeout event, so even with the fix patch, the result is \"install\" -\u003e \"activate\" -\u003e \"skipWaiting resolved\", am I right?",

It calls skipWaiting and sends an IPC to the browser (OnSkipWaiting() is called).\n5: Activate procedure is triggered (it\u0027s L.1321-1329 in this patch)\n6: Activate event is triggered and it\u0027s sent to the renderer.\n\nIf it\u0027s correct, I think the test works well once your patch lands.\nWDYT?",
