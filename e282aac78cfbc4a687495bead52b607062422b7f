      "message": "This is the biggest change I had to make. Note that unprovision_bytes can only be set by the code inside of \"if (truncated_slots)\". Therefore it is more logical (and also allows us to reduce the scope of three variables) to move \"if (unprovisioned_bytes \u0026\u0026 discard) {\" into the same block. This then avoids variable shadowing on begin_ptr and end_ptr.",
