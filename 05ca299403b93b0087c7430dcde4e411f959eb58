      "message": "Wondering if this test can be improved a bit. Currently the line that calls getPreviewsEnabled() in the prod code is not tested. One could delete it, and this test (and next one) would still pass.\n\nNormally, you would test this as follows:\n1) TestPageHandler extends TestBrowserProxy,see examples https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q\u003dTestBrowserProxy+lang:js\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026type\u003dcs.\n\n2) Instead of manually calling getPreviewsEnabled(), would would call\ntestPageHandler.whenCalled(\u0027getPreviewsEnabled\u0027).then(function() {\n ... assertions here\n});\n\nThis way the test actually ensures that the prod code does call getPreviewsEnabled.",

The reason I had to do it that way is because the prod\u0027s getPreviewsEnabled is called when the website is done loading.\n\nIs there a way to do customize the proload stage so that we can use\n  window.testPageHandler.setPreviewsEnabled(enabled);\nfor each test?",

      "message": "I think there is. It\u0027s not super pretty though. So first let me give you some examples from code that has now been deleted, from chrome://plugins which also used Mojo, see [1] and [2]. Specifically sethe window.setupFn in [1] and the comment. [2] was fixing some race condition that was not addressed by [1].\n\n[1] https://codereview.chromium.org/1726153002/diff/100001/chrome/browser/resources/plugins.js\n[2] https://codereview.chromium.org/2563743002/\n\nThe overall idea is the following:\n - Define a dummy window.setupFn function that in prod code simply does nothing (return immediately resolved promise), but make prod code wait for that Promise to resolve before doing anything.\n - Within the  test\u0027s preLoad() method you will override window.setupFn to return a Promise that you control with a PromiseResolver. Once the Mocha lifecycle methods start being called, you will setup any fake data/proxies, then you will resolve the Promise via the PromiseResolver. Effectively you create a time window where the loaded page simply waits without doing anything, so that the test has time to setup fake stuff.\n\nI hope this makes sense. There might be an easier way I have not thought of (it\u0027s been a while since I tested a Mojo-based page).",

However, returning to your previous comments about the whenCalled(\u0027getPreviewsEnabled\u0027). When this promise got resolved, the result actually has not been rendered on the DOM yet. Because on index.js, when testPageHandler.getReviewsEnabled() resolved, there are codes that have not executed yet.",
