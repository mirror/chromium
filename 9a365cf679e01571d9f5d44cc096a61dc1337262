      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is the correct fix. This CL isn\u0027t working for example when:\n1. Open html from crbug.com/780761\n2. Add autofill address with city\u003dSpringfield to profile\n3. Click city input to show autofill popup\n4. Hover mouse over Springfield suggestion\n5. Move mouse outside autofill popup\nExpected: city field doesn\u0027t have purple border\nActual: city field has purple border\n\nThe real problem is that we are conflating HTMLInputElement::is_placeholder_visible_ with two meanings.\n- TextControlElement::UpdatePlaceholderVisibility is using the \"is placeholder element (placeholder and suggestion) shown\" meaning\n- SelectorChecker::CheckPseudoClass is using the \"is placeholder (not suggestion) shown\" meaning\n\nHTMLInputElement::is_placeholder_visible_ should probably be used with the second meaning for SelectorChecker::CheckPseudoClass.\nI think we might need to add a new bool in TextControlElement for the first meaning.\nWhen we do that I think we might want to call UpdatePlaceholderVisibility() right after UpdatePlaceholderText() in TextControlElement::SetSuggestedValue.",
