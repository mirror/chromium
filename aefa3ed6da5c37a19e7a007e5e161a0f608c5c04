      "message": "\u003cterrible-idea\u003e\nCould/should we just RunTask() the |pending_task| here but continue in the case of it having already been cancelled, to minimize the semantic effect of this change?  We\u0027d still have the overhead of tracing, Did/WillProcessTask, etc, but we\u0027d be avoiding the overhead of returning to the task processing loop.\n\u003c/terrible-idea\u003e\n\nOr, just move this logic into a static helper method that  accepts |pending_task| and |pending_high_res_tasks_| and decrements the latter if the former is a high-res task and we\u0027re on Windows, to avoid duplicating this code another three times.",

      "message": "It\u0027s a bit odd to check IsCancelled() and then dispatch it anyway \u003d)\n\nThere\u0027s several issues with trying to combine this code:\n- deferred_non_nestable_work_queue_ and delayed_work_queue_ are different types: the former is a queue, the latter is a priority_queue. We\u0027d have to template it.\n- they don\u0027t have quite the same semantics: sweeping only pops if the task is cancelled, while this one unconditionally pops. We could have it just pop as well here.\n\nI just added a helper to decrement the count if needed, which saves a few lines of copied and pasted code.",
