      "message": "The name of the method and this param threw me off.\n\nI wonder if these would be clearer if it was getServiceWorkerUrlWithManifest...getNonServiceWorkerUrlWithManifest.  The problem is that those both imply that \"this is a service worker url that has a manifest\".  I don\u0027t honestly think this is any better.\n\nMy thinking is that with getNativeBannerUrlWithManifest is that it doesn\u0027t actually require that the manifest passed in is a native app one.  Just that it\u0027s applying this manifest to a URL that has no service worker defined.\n\nNames are hard...it\u0027s a lovely shade of lilac blue though.",

I\u0027m planning a renaming CL after this and its follow-up have landed (since there are names like this in lots of places) to try and make things a bit more consistent and consolidate more url stuff in here. We can bikeshed more over names when I get to that. :)",
