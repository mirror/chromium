      "message": "M61 will be the first time to use background blur in the production code path of chromium. So either ways will be fine to define this API.\n\nRounding errors will be the major concern. Although GaussianBlur will take float sigma, what will be the effect if sigma * 3.0f has big difference than static_cast\u003cint\u003e(ceilf(sigma * 3.0f))? I can see everything will be approximate at last. The radius user set may not be the exact radius used in the blur. So this may not be an issue. \n\nsenorblanco@, WDYT?",

      "message": "If it\u0027s a new API, I\u0027d prefer a float sigma here, as used elsewhere in Skia, Blink and in the web platform specs. It allows subpixel blurring, which can be nice for animation. I also don\u0027t think pretending that the sigma is an integer pixel measurement has much value, since the affected area may be greater or fewer than 3 * sigma pixels in width anyway. (An integer radius is even more misleading on that front.)",
