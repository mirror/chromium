Better to be clear on this point, too, in the comment above.\n\nSupposing that this only installs the runtime-enabled features, RuntimeEnabledPropertiesInstaller for example?  RuntimeEnabledFeaturesInstaller is fine for me, too.  Of course, any other better names are welcome.\n\nGiven that this only handles v8::Object case, we can give the name based on it.  At least, we can comment about it (i.e. v8::ObjectTemplate case is handled separately).",
