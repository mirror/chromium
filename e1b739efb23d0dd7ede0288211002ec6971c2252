      "message": "I guess using bare base::Histogram here is to pass the flag and to call AddCount() thaose are not supported in platform/Histogram.h. But could you modify Histogram.h to support them?\n\nI\u0027d keep metrics code in this source file to be consistent as possible, and having AddCount() and flag in blink sounds useful.\n\nAlso, static_casts\u0027 target type are not accurate here, they should be casts to Sample or uint32_t. For Sample type, this file has ToSample(), and we may need ToBucketCount() for ...hum... bucket_count is uint32_t in base/, but is int32_t in platform/Histogram :(",
