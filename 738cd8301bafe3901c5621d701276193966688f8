      "message": "You mean 1 hour vs 2 hours? No, that\u0027s correct, though very much not obvious. The code below computes a \"candidate delay\" as 2 * current_delay. If that\u0027s larger than the max, it just sticks with the existing delay. So with a limit of 2 hours, it\u0027s only guaranteed that the actual max delay will be larger than 1 hour.\n(FWIW, I\u0027m working on a followup to clean up this convoluted logic, but I wanted a minimally-intrusive mitigation first.)",
