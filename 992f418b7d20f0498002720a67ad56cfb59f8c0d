      "message": "So in one of my follow up changes I wanted to add a MakeSubset method to provide the SkImage-\u003emakeSubset functionality. It would take a copy of the original image (content included) and just add a subset rect. Something similar will need to happen for the color space.\n\nDo you think we could do something like add a flag to this (retain_content bool or enum)?",

      "message": "Hmm.. I think that\u0027s reasonable. But why would you go through PaintImageBuilder for that functionality? If you already have a PaintImage you should be able to subset it already?\n\nEither that or do\nPaintImageBuilder(existing_image.MakeSubset(...)).set_whatever(...).TakePaintImage()?\n\nEither way works for me, but I would prefer to add the enum in the patch that would actually use it.",
