The intent is that you should be able to do \n\nPaintImageBuilder().set_id(...).set_image(...); and have that be a static complete image (since that\u0027s typically what we want and what you would get with PaintImage(id, image) before this patch.\n\nAlso, there are no uses of UNKNOWN anymore. It was only used in one of the cases that I fixed up in this patch.",

It would take a copy of the original image (content included) and just add a subset rect. Something similar will need to happen for the color space.\n\nDo you think we could do something like add a flag to this (retain_content bool or enum)?",
