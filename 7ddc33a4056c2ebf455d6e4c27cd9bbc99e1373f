      "message": "The emoji is cute... but I don\u0027t think it adds anything, and risks odd behaviour in outdated version control tools. Even when I\u0027m actually fixing emoji bugs in Chrome I try to avoid putting them in CL descriptions (like http://crrev.com/c/720581 :). But, Chrome still has emoji bugs - e.g. http://crbug.com/566954 is a renderer crash triggered by emoji -- you don\u0027t want your CL description to be the cause of someone being unable to view the git log.",
