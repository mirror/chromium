      "message": "I\u0027m not totally sure I agree with this. Suppose the user went from 2g -\u003e offline, for that reporting period, it makes sense to say 2g. If they stayed offline for the entire next reporting period, why would we want to report that as 2g?\n\nWhat about adding offline to the conditional below instead? So if (min \u003d\u003d unknown || min \u003d\u003d offline) \u0026\u0026 (max \u003d\u003d unknown || max \u003d\u003d offline) {min \u003d type; max \u003d type;}",

      "message": "I think the device being offline during the complete lifetime of UMA report is an interesting case. However, conceptually, it does not differ much from device going offline for a brief period of time. \n\nIn general, it should not be possible to load requests if the device is offline. So, I am not too worried about that affecting metrics.\n\nIn the worst case, it is possible to exclude such reports by looking at connection_type field which includes the device connection type.",
