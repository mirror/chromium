In fact (oversight on my part), this documentation really should not be referring to processes at all since that\u0027s a detail of the system, not a guarantee of the API. (we may choose to run data_decoder in-process someday, in some cases.)\n\nMaybe something like \"If |batch_id| is non-empty, the system may batch this parse request with other parse requests using the same |batch_id| in an effort to amortize the overhead of a single request.
