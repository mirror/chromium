It changes to [800, 600] with this CL because \u003chtml\u003e has overflow:hidden and the viewport is not user scrollable and we apply the viewport clip on the contents layer.\n\nMost of the other new baselines are of the same reason.",

In the following case:\n  \u003cdiv style\u003d\"width: 100px; height: 100px; overflow: scroll-y; writing-mode: vertical-rl\"\u003e...\u003c/div\u003e\neven if the div is not scrollable, we create a ScrollTranslation node with translation -15,0 to move the contents to the left. The div\u0027s ScrollOrigin is zero, and ContentsSize is 85x100. FlipForWritingMode() doesn\u0027t work for the case because it flips in the border box rect, not the client rect.",
