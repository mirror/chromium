      "message": "As discussed offline, I\u0027m not sure this is right: the current non-S13nServiceWorker code aborts the callbacks when the service worker is destroyed. I think this patch should keep the current non-S13nSW behavior when S13nSW is disabled, and it can incrementally change the S13nSW behavior when S13nSW is enabled.\n\nMy question was about the \"kill on timeout\" flag in ServiceWorkerVersion. This patch isn\u0027t implementing \"kill on timeout\" for S13nSW which is fine (we can do it in a later patch). But we should try to not change the non-S13nSW behavior.",
