      "message": "I think the right way to phrase this is:\n\n\"Success to us means System Health benchmarks cast a wide enough net to catch major regressions before they make it to the users.\"\n\nThis has two small changes (in addition to the create/cast change) from your sentence:\n\n- I switched \"that\" to \"to\". I spent a little while trying to think about why \"that\" sounds funny. Unfortunately, I think this is basically just another idiom: both \"that\" and \"to\" in this context indicate the purpose of the preceding noun. However, the phrase is usually \u003cadjective\u003e enough TO \u003csome objective\u003e\" (e.g. \"fit enough to run a marathon\", \"responsible enough to do her homework\") rather than \"\u003cadjective\u003e enough THAT \u003csome objective\u003e\". This shows up in this list of phrases (https://www.phrases.org.uk/cgi-bin/phrase-thesaurus/exact.cgi?w\u003denough), but I\u0027m not sure I can really say why this is.\n\n- I switched \"catches\" to \"catch\". The subject here is still \"System Health benchmarks\", which means the verb should be plural, therefore \"catch\"",
