      "message": "nit: Maybe elaborate a bit more since this comment is confusing in isolation from the bug. How about:\n\n // We want to bind this interface as early as possible, but the\n // constructor is too early. Subclasses may not be fully initialized at\n // that point and thus may be unable to properly fulfill the \n // BindInterface call. Instead we bind here since the subclass constructor\n // has already run and this is the first potential use of the interface.",
