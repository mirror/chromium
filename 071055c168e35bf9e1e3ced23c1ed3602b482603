This call will display the context menu from top left of the screen I guess. So there should be a way to figure out whether topContentOffsetYPx is explicitly set and if not, call animation \u003d new ScaleAnimation(fromX, toX, fromY, toY, Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF, 0.5f, Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF, 0.5f).",
