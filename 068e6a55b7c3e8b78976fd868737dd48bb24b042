      "message": "Bubbles that have BubbleDialogDelegateView::close_on_deactivate() returning false should not automatically dismiss. Also right-clicking parts of the UI that don\u0027t show a menu should also dismiss (when close_on_deactivate is true).\n\nI think the solution to this bug needs to look more like the code in -[BaseBubbleController registerKeyStateEventTap]. i.e. watch for right-click and invoke windowDidResignKey:\n\nAlso is it possible to test?\n\nSomething in native_widget_mac_uniteractive_uitest.mm has the best chance.",
