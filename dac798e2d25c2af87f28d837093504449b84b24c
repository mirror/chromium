      "message": "The code that uses it is in the pref-pane that is no longer installed because of this CL. So this CL does remove it, in a sense :)\nA followup CL will completely purge all of the pref-pane code.\nI don\u0027t think there is a serious version problem. The old pref-pane might still be running while this script is updated. If the user tries to do anything with it, it performs a version-check which will detect the mismatched versions, and it puts up an alert which says that the pref-pane needs to be restarted. Pressing OK on this dialog is the only place where it will try to use this deleted command-line option. It will therefore fail to restart the pref-pane, and the user will be left with an open pref-pane with all controls disabled. It will look a bit weird that the pref-pane is still running, but nothing really bad will happen.",

      "message": "Actually, the pref-pane won\u0027t be left running; it self-terminates. So the effect would be that the user is presented with an alert that the pref-pane needs to be restarted. They click OK, but the pref-pane disappears and doesn\u0027t come back.\nAlternatively, we could try to make the installer close any open pref-pane (during the preflight script where we actually delete the pref-pane bundle). I\u0027ve read through Apple\u0027s pref-pane developer guide, and done a few Internet searches, but haven\u0027t found any way to do this.\nI don\u0027t think the behavior is bad enough to justify some staged rollout over 2 versions.",
