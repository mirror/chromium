      "message": "I think this is a somewhat misleading comment change. Yes, CloneableMessage is in some manner used for MessageChannel, but only because TransferableMessage (the struct type actually being used for MessagePort/MessageChannel) happens to include it. As explained by both the comment above and the comment regarding TransferableMessage.\n\nThe comment was trying to make it clear that BroadcastChannel in a way is special for using CloneableMessage directly instead of TransferableMessage.",
