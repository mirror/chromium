      "message": "Prefer a longer comment (if my understanding is correct): If this registration impl is for a service worker execution context, |this| lives on the worker thread but |binding_| is bound on the IO thread due to limitations of channel-associated interfaces. Close |binding_| here since this is the thread it was bound on, then hop to the worker thread to handle lifetime of |this|. In the case of a service worker client, both |this| and |binding_| live on the IO thread, so the binding can be closed normally during destruction.",
