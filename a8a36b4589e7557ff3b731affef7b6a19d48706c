As BOOL !\u003d bool when targeting 32-bit architectures, this cause compilation failure.\n\nA simple fix would be to change this to have a conversion to bool using the !! trick (!! is a bool no-op but is defined to return bool in C++):\n\n  ConditionBlock condition \u003d ^{\n    return !![[UIPastboard generalPasteboard].string containsString:@\"www.a.fr\"];\n  };",
