Can user just call this method and then resolveNode by nodeId?\nFrom compatibility point of view - I think it\u0027s better to add separate method here, or at least move new optional argument to the end.",

We\u0027d like to avoid both for users that retrieve nodes (and their backend IDs) via the DOMSnapshot domain.\n\nPavel suggested adding a backendNodeId param here, but I\u0027m happy to add a separate command instead or move the param to the end if that\u0027s beneficial for compat.",

It is now clear that nodeId does not work for the automation case, it only works for inspection. So I would be in favor of migrating (adding) to backendNodeIds where ever possible to enable automation.",
