      "message": "Give that this class no longer needs to interact with JavaScript the use of setter and getter functions is unnecessary. I\u0027d consider making the members public and removing the functions (except for Trace, obviously). Of course, that may trigger far more changes to other files than desired. If that\u0027s the case it seems pretty reasonable to keep this structured as-is and maybe revisit the getter/setter design as a followup.",
