      "message": "Writing zero bytes _is_ permitted by write(), and is specifically called-out as being a way of testing for certain error conditions.\n\nIt almost seems that we should be passing a dummy pointer in the zero-bytes case, rather than not calling write(), but at that point I\u0027d be tempted to just make Fuchsia compatible with everything else. :-/",

      "message": "It is permitted and may be useful in some cases, but I don\u0027t think it means that we have to call [p]write() for File::Write(0). base::File provides cross-platform FS access. It doesn\u0027t have to mirror system API behavior. Treating Write(0) as no-op seems to be appropriate here. If any code needs to use write(0) for something useful then it shouldn\u0027t be using base::File.\nFWIW MSDN says that null writes are FS-dependent, i.e. some file systems may not allow it.",
