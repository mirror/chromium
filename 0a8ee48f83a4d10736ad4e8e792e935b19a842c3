      "message": "As currently factored, it\u0027s not clear to me why it\u0027s safe to repurpose PHYSICAL_MEMORY as MEMORY_FOOTPRINT.\n\nThe idea of RefreshType is that each separately-collectible metric should have its own bit, so that we can avoid the cost of collecting the source data for columns that aren\u0027t visible. MEMORY_DETAILS and PHYSICAL_MEMORY were separately-collected data sources: SharedSamplerWin provided the REFRESH_TYPE_PHYSICAL_MEMORY source for the \u0027physical mem\u0027 column (using the all-processes-in-one-shot technique), but on Windows, the REFRESH_TYPE_MEMORY_DETAILS source for the \u0027shared mem, swapped mem, and private mem\u0027 columns were collected via task_group.cc (i.e. they were gathered separately for each pid, rather than all-in-one shot via the shared_sampler).\n\nSince you\u0027re now adding a new column, with its own source, it seems like you ought to add a new RefreshType as well.\n\nLet me know if I\u0027ve misunderstood the above -- I\u0027m not against reifying the RefreshType enum if you\u0027ve in fact noticed that we were doing something unnecessary.",
