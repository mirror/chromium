      "message": "+1 to test that this doesn\u0027t have issues with those strange strings that get shorter with more characters (or maybe just end with 0-width glyph characters and thus don\u0027t get longer?)... I\u0027m not sure how to construct meaningful examples, but maybe try testing ligatures like fi and cases where including trailing (logically-ordered) characters of a Bidi (mixed ltr and rtl) string yields thinner glyphs up front when visually-ordered... jeez that might be tough, maybe ping a i18n reviewer! You can use fixed glyph widths in render text tests, maybe you\u0027d want to add the ability to use preset, but varying-length glyph sizes? This isn\u0027t easy, but it\u0027d be good to avoid infinite loops or similar with weird omnibox strings",
