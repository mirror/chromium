We might make use of ReleasePeerConnectionHandler() or DCHECK that the utility function is called before the handler does not exist.\n\nIt probably makes more sense to construct the PC with closed_ \u003d stopped_ \u003d false or to replace these, but I feel like this discussion is outside the scope of this CL.",
