      "message": "I want to call attention to this just to make sure we don\u0027t accidentally venture into undefined behavior.\n\nThis is done for type punning, which is legal in C. But in C++, it is undefined behavior (assigning one union member and then reading another).\n\nThis header is only included from .c files. There are no special flags in the BUILD.gn to force using a C standard but perhaps the default treatment of .c files is to compile as C and not C++. If so, this is fine -- it is just something we should be aware of.\n\nAnother bit of interest is the alternate union member is only ever read via a memcpy right now. memcpy has special semantics for aliasing, but I don\u0027t think it has special semantics for this UB.",

      "message": "I believe the designated initializers we use below to initialize this union would also make all the C++ compilers sound the klaxons if we accidentally tried to treat this as C++.\n\nBut if we\u0027re feeling anxious, I bet it wouldn\u0027t hurt the codegen to just fill a local array with the splatted values and then memcpy them into a non-union 16-byte chunk, e.g.\n\nstatic inline Chunk splat4(const void* src) {\n    int32_t v;\n    memcpy(\u0026v, src, sizeof(v));\n\n    int32_t vs[] \u003d { v,v,v,v };\n    Chunk c;\n    memcpy(\u0026c, vs, sizeof(vs));\n\n    return c;\n}\n\n(Lots of compilers _do_ violate the standard to make this union punning explicitly safe even in C++.  I believe that list includes GCC and MSVC, but I can\u0027t remember about Clang.)",

Although the standard doesn\u0027t define anything (nor call out that the implementation can define it), I\u0027m pretty sure VC, Intel, GCC, and Clang all do what we expect.\n\nI\u0027m not too worried about it.
