      "message": "Matt, what do you think of making this +\u003d headers and dropping the EXPECT_FALSE above? This allows us to have an \"Occurred at least once\" and \"Occurred never\" semantic.\n\nI am not sure how else we could keep external factors out while still keeping this as an integration test (which I think it a good thing in this case).",

      "message": "The issue is that the GoogleURLTracker issues a request to https:/www.google.com/ in unittest mode. This means that we would need to request a different URL in this test case. We could certainly do that but it is kind of nice to check the homepage. Do you prefer that we test https://www.google.com/foobar instead? It feels a bit dirty to me as well but I\u0027m fine with it. The setup may become a bit more cumbersome when we register all relevant URLs.",
