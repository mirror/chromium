      "message": "I haven\u0027t done this change in the final patch set. \nInitially I thought that we will remove EndingVisibleSelection(), but as\ndiscussed with Xiaochengh we will make EndingVisbleSelection as protected member of editor commands. This was the reason i went ahead by not doing change in ReplacementFragment, as it may not solve any overhead of calculating canonicalized values. \nShall i make this layout update change included in the final patch ?",
