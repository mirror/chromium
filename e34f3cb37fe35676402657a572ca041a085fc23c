I feel like many developers would assume they can put anything they want into an anonymous namespace without having to worry about naming conflicts.\n\n(Or alternatively, would it be prohibitively complicated to add eg. a pragma to clang to make it forget anything seen so far in an anonymous namespace, and insert that between translation units?)",

Just realizing that this is apparently common in chrome/browser/android. any idea why?\n\n\nPS: Please don\u0027t try to fix those things with more complicated means like pragmas, etc.",
