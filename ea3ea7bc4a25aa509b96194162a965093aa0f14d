      "message": "You asked me to point out anything I found confusing.\n\nWell I\u0027m confused about the difference between UpdateRegistrationUI and UpdateUI - are these two different kind of updates? From looking at this function and the one above, it seems that we\n\n1. Update Registration UI in the data manager\n2. Update UI in the relevant job controller, as part of DidUpdateRegistrationUI\n3. Run the \u0027Update UI Callback\u0027 - (which presumably updates some more UI ???), also as part of DidUpdateRegistrationUI\n\nCould you maybe make the method names more descriptive?",

      "message": "I agree it\u0027s confusing. It all comes from:https://wicg.github.io/background-fetch/#dom-backgroundfetchupdateevent-updateui\n\nWe define a method called UpdateUI on the Javascript Background Fetch Registration object, which calls in BackgroundFetchServiceImpl.\n\nThe DataManager is just a data store (or at least it will be when I\u0027m done). So this is saying update the storage for Registration\u0027s UI.\n\nThe JobController actually changes what\u0027s shown to the user.\n\nThe UpdateUICallback is the signal that\u0027s sent back (ultimately to Javascript) to say that the callback succeeded. (it doesn\u0027t update any UI).\n\nI\u0027ve renamed the JobController method to UpdateJobTitle as suggested in your other comment - although I suspect in the future the JS method may be updated to add other kinds of UI like images.",
