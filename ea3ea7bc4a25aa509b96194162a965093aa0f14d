      "message": "You asked me to point out anything I found confusing.\n\nWell I\u0027m confused about the difference between UpdateRegistrationUI and UpdateUI - are these two different kind of updates? From looking at this function and the one above, it seems that we\n\n1. Update Registration UI in the data manager\n2. Update UI in the relevant job controller, as part of DidUpdateRegistrationUI\n3. Run the \u0027Update UI Callback\u0027 - (which presumably updates some more UI ???), also as part of DidUpdateRegistrationUI\n\nCould you maybe make the method names more descriptive?",
