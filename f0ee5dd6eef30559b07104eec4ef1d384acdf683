As such, this is fragile - the other code may change at any time, and nobody will know that this must be updated. I\u0027d rather make whatever dependency we require obvious in the API well call.",

      "message": "Fair enough. I totally agree with you and that\u0027s what I originally did. But owners of constrained_window doesn\u0027t like that change and is concerned about changing the behavior of other dialogs.\n\n+wittman: I kinda agree with Mattias that users of the constrained_window::ShowWebModalDialogViews API won\u0027t necessarily know all these details and it\u0027s seem pretty easy to introduce crashes somewhere. Asking the caller to do some magic check won\u0027t really scale.",
