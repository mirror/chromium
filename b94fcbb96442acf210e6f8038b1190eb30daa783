As it turns out, unfortunately, yes it is still needed (the public:blink_headers target depends on public:generate_mojo_bindings which depends on public:mojo_bindings_blink__generator, and public:mojo_bindings depends on common:mojo_platform_bindings, but the __generator targets don\u0027t really work for transitive dependencies, and generate_mojo_bindings only has private deps anyway, so it wouldn\u0027t help with making any headers available for gn check anyway...)\n\nSo another fix would be to change public:generate_mojo_bindings to use public_deps rather than deps, and additionally add an explicit dependency on //third_party/WebKit/common:mojo_platform_bindings_blink__generator to public:generate_mojo_bindings.",
