Are they their own wholly contained type of animation or do they build on top of or otherwise make use of the more base set of transform, opacity, filter animations?\n\nAdded comments in ScrollAnimator.h about the use of compositor animation machinery.  Tried to clarify terminology throughout.  (\"Smooth scrolling\" is synonymous with \"scroll offset animation\" which can be input-driven or programmatic.)\n\n\u003e Subsequent prose reads as if it builds atop but it\u0027s phrased in such a way that I think what it\u0027s saying is that other totally Mac specific logic handles scroll offset animations, rather than using other cc animation(s) to effect them.\n\nAdded comments in ScrollAnimatorMac.h clarifying that Mac is a special snowflake.\n\n\u003e Re: scroll offset animation type/property, there are for example:\n\u003e \n\u003e TargetProperty:\n\u003e https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/trees/target_property.h?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d17\n\u003e \n\u003e AnimationCurve:\n\u003e https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/animation/animation_curve.h?q\u003dSCROLL_OFFSET+animation\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr\u003dCSs\u0026l\u003d34\n\nYes, non-Mac compositor-serviced smooth scrolls use these.
