      "message": "Commenting here in the Mac one as I am reading it first, but some additions probably make sense to add in non-Mac classes.\n\nAre these the same as, related to, or different from, smooth scrolling? Are they their own wholly contained type of animation or do they build on top of or otherwise make use of the more base set of transform, opacity, filter animations?\n\nSubsequent prose reads as if it builds atop but it\u0027s phrased in such a way that I think what it\u0027s saying is that other totally Mac specific logic handles scroll offset animations, rather than using other cc animation(s) to effect them.\n\nRe: scroll offset animation type/property, there are for example:\n\nTargetProperty:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/trees/target_property.h?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d17\n\nAnimationCurve:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/animation/animation_curve.h?q\u003dSCROLL_OFFSET+animation\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr\u003dCSs\u0026l\u003d34\n\nLayerAnimationElement::AnimatableProperty which I think is wholly unrelated but am not sure:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/compositor/layer_animation_element.h?type\u003dcs\u0026q\u003dLayerAnimationElement::AnimatableProperty\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d39\n\nHow do these interact, and if there are platform specific considerations re: them, describing them in top level ScrollAnimator or README.md would be helpful.",
