      "message": "Odd question while I\u0027m here: do we ever have to add https scheme now?  For example, in the coming future, we won\u0027t display https:// in the omnibox in resting mode, but we will want it for the copy if it\u0027s part of the underlying URL.  Likewise, we might not display https:// in the fill_into_edit part of URLs in the dropdown, but we would want to copy them with it.  Can you think about / future-proof against these cases while you\u0027re here?",
