      "message": "\u003e Is this because the Mojo IPC is sync?\n\nYes.  If the utility process fails to start or crashes, the error callback is invoked and the sync IPC call terminates (and returns empty results).\n\n\u003e Does this need to be set at all?\n\nYes.  The utility process mojo client DCHECK\u0027s that an error callback has been set when you Start() the utility process; see the code and comments at http://bit.ly/2t52UdU and http://bit.ly/2t5j5aJ",

      "message": "\u003e Why are these becoming sync IPCs if they weren\u0027t sync before?\n\nAs discussed in [1], code-left blocked the caller with a WaitableEvent.Wait() waiting on an async response from the utility process, which Signal()s the event and unblocks the caller.  Seems like a round-about way to create the same effect as a SYNC IPC.\n\n[1] https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/538519/5/chrome%252Fbrowser%252Fwin%252Fchrome_select_file_dialog_factory.cc#174",
