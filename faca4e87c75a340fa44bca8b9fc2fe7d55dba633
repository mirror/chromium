      "message": "can this pass |browser_|? I think the logic in UpdateCreateHostedAppLabel() can move to GetCreateHostedAppMenuItemName() then.\n\nI see that |zoom_label_| is closer to your approach, but it\u0027s more complex. Also it\u0027s creating repeated code - if that approach is needed we should add a `UpdateDynamicLabels()` method that ActiveTabChanged/TabReplacedAt/NOTIFICATION_NAV_ENTRY_COMMITTED invoke, and which will call both updaters. But I think it\u0027s safe to move the WebContents access to occur here (unless I\u0027ve missed something)",
