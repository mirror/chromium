OutgoingBrokerClientInvitation it has a pointer to.\n\nWhen the GPU thread runs the deleted OutgoingBrokerClientInvitation\u0027s ExtractInProcessMessagePipe() it crashes on the NOTREACHED because attached_ports_ has already been destructed.\n\nA simpler solution may be to just fix the destruction order. I already suggested that here https://codereview.chromium.org/2973723003/diff/1/content/browser/gpu/gpu_process_host.h (as a solution to another race). What do you think?",
