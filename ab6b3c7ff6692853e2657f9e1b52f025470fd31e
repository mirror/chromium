      "message": "Does the MainThreadFrameObserver actually wait for composite?\n\nSeems like either:\n1. The comment is wrong.\n2. We made the test flaky.\n3. MainThreadFrameObserver is named poorly.\n\nLooks like it\u0027s probably option 3? If MainThreadFrameObserver actually observes compositor frames as well, can we rename it before depending on it in these tests?",

      "message": "So MainThreadFrameObserver waits on an ACK from RenderWidget.\nWhen the ack is received by the browser process it is enqueued. This queue is not processed until a new FrameToken is received.\n\nSo while the ack can arrive before a compositor frame has been submitted. The processing doesn\u0027t occur until after the token for that frame submission arrives.\n\nI\u0027d certainly be up for renaming this class to help clarify this.",
