      "message": "I deliberately separated this path in http://crrev.com/497601, not just because it\u0027s for the non-SCL path, but because setting the needs-invalidation bits on the LayoutObject is a different thing from actually issuing the invalidation.  Unfortunately we use the verb \"invalidate\" for both of these which causes a lot of confusion.  I think we should try not to have a method that does invalidation-issuing in the SCL case but only needs-invalidation-bit-setting in the non-SCL case.",
