The user could be typing an URL in the address bar, get focus stolen by the dialog and have their space/enter key press misinterpreted as consenting to Chrome Cleanup and reporting data to Google. \n\nThis consent isn\u0027t reversible and puts the user in an unexpected state. I think avoiding these false prompt acceptance is worth deviating from the normal modal dialog behavior.",
