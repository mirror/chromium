      "message": "As I mentioned in-person last week, most/all of Chrome\u0027s ShelfItemDelegate subclasses use LauncherContextMenu::Create as the impl here. I could potentially change ShelfItemDelegate to store a base::Callback for generating context menu models (with a late-binding display_id arg), and make ChromeLauncherController set that callback for most/all of the delegates it creates; that would avoid needing to override this new GetContextMenu method for each of Chrome\u0027s delegate subclasses. That may be a worthwhile consolidation/cleanup; I\u0027ll investigate after lunch...",
