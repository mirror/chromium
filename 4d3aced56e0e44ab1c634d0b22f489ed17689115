      "message": "BTW, pursuant to our conversation the other day: this name is actually now worse than the old one as a reader, because it looks as if this call gives a me a new tab (not a feature engagement tracker).  The old name was verbose; this is misleading.\n\nI still think one of the following courses would be best:\n* No namespace, keep NewTabFeatureEngagementTracker as classname\n* Namespace feature_engagement[_tracker]::, classname NewTab[Tracker]Factory (I\u0027d probably put the \"tracker\" on the classname here and not the namespace).  If you do this, make the directory name for the general feature engagement stuff match the namespace name and put everything in there in that namespace",
