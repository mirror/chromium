      "message": "Be careful, \"stream\" is an overloaded term here, and so this is not really true.\n\nAn IPC channel has multiple \"streams\", each of which has multiple command buffers. Command buffers in the same share group must be in the same stream. A stream is the granularity of scheduling.\n\nMultiple command buffers within the same stream can use an ordering barrier to order their commands, but command buffers in different streams need a sync token. If the 2 streams are on the same IPC channel (i.e. same client process), they can use unverified sync tokens, but if they are on different channels, the token needs to be verified.",

A class that implements this interface is compatible with the CHROMIUM_gpu_fence mechanism, and a GpuFence object owns the resources backing a GpuFenceHandle and is responsible for cleaning them up.\n\nThe caller uses AsClientGpuFence for the InsertClientGpuFenceCHROMIUM argument, and the implementation will then use GetGpuFenceHandle on the underlying object for IPC transport.\n\nWe\u0027ve been through multiple variations of this in the course of the review, and this is-a implementation seemed cleanest overall.\n\nBasically, the choices are:\n\n- the current implementation: GLFence is-a GpuFence since it\u0027s basically directly usable as a ClientGpuFence for the API.\n\n- don\u0027t have a GpuFence class at all, and work with GpuFenceHandle directly throughout the API. This could work, but would make resource ownership rather nasty. GpuFenceHandle is copyable, but the underlying resource (file descriptor in this case) must be closed exactly once.\n\n- make GpuFence a pure container that owns a GpuFenceHandle. I had this implemented in PS42, see https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/680135/42/ui/gfx/gpu_fence.h and https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/680135/42/ui/gl/gl_fence.h . This was rather confusing since a GLFence conceptually owns the resource, so in this implementation GLFence::GetGpuFenceHandle passed ownership to the caller. The resulting code in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/680135/42/docs/design/gpu_synchronization.md looked weird, where the \"send fence\" case needed to create a GLFence using a special CreateForGpuFence method and then use the GpuFenceHandle from it to construct a GpuFence. In review you had requested that I should rename CreateForGpuFence to CreateGpuFence which I think is evidence that it\u0027s a confusing API - this kind of GLFence isn\u0027t a GpuFence, just a specially constructed GLFence that can be used to create a GpuFence.\n\n- have GpuFence own a GLFence. This seems like a layering violation unless we make a EGLGpuFence subclass just for this purpose, and would involve a fair amount of boilerplate since we\u0027d need a GetUnderlyingGLFence method.\n\nI\u0027d be happy to discuss this more, but I think this seems to be the cleanest approach so far.",

GLFence is different from GLSurface and GLImage which have public Initialize methods that the caller must use after construction. The existing GLFence variants just build objects in the constructor, assuming it can\u0027t fail. The new types can have construction fail, so there needs to be a new mechanism to handle that.\n\nThe public API is to use the Create factory methods to get an initialized objects, it calls InitializeInternal to make this happen. I\u0027ve made this CreateInternal private since clients of this class should use one of the two public creation methods to ensure that the resulting object works as a non-null GpuFence. Clients could use GLFenceEGL::Create(type, attribs) to get an equivalent EGL object which may be useful for low-level code, but they shouldn\u0027t expect that to work as a GpuFence.\n\nAs per earlier discussions in the CL, I think changing the GLFence contract to require explicit client-side initialization would be a potential trap since in current usage a new GLFence is immediately usable. A private constructor with factory methods seemed cleanest.",
