      "message": "All of these functions would be slightly cleaner by dynamically generating the metrics name as \"TabManager.\" + kSessionTypeName[type] + \".\" + metric_name, and then looking up the histogram directly using the Histogram API in base/metrics/histograms.h. Maybe a RecordTabManagerMetric(SessionType type, const char* metric_name, double value) ?\n\nAs is, this is a lot of copied code. And the macros are optimized for metrics that are called MANY MANY times per second, which is not the case here. So we don\u0027t need the complicated caching and code expansion that backs them.",
