Could call it network_tracker_browsertest - that is pretty specific...  network_service_browsertest seems too general, though.\n\nAnyhow, the advantage of putting it there is we own it, and I suspect chrome/OWNERS aren\u0027t really great reviewers for this file.",

Could also update the comment to make that explicit.\n\nActually...This is only called from OnConnectionChanged, so it should always complete synchronously, right?  So no need to block, can just assert it completes synchronously.  If you do that, I think it would make the most send to inline it in OnConnectionChanged.",

We could change one of the APIs, or make a helper inner class, that just listens to one type of event or the other...Not sure that really gets us much, though.\n\nThat having been said...Do we need this?  It will require some work, but we can create a UI-thread content::mojom::NetworkServicePtr for the IOThread\u0027s NetworkService.  This will probably be useful in the future, even if it does require a bit of setting up.\n\nWe may still need this, eventually, for use in other content embedders, not sure, but I think it would be good if we could use the mojo interface in production chrome.",
