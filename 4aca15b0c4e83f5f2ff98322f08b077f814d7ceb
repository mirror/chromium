      "message": "//chrome/VERSION would work if we made the download step first run _UpdateReferenceApks if they were out of date but that would make resource_sizes.py fail if we try to run it on the bots in the future (unlikely).. I added a note in the README about updating the current milestone but I\u0027ll change it to parse the .sha1 files if you\u0027d prefer that.",
