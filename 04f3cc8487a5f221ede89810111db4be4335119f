This would be safer.\n\nWe already passing some data to AnswerCardContents at L171 for example.",

      "message": "When I introduced SetIsMouseInView, xiyuan@ was quite unhappy, as this event gets passed to the UI layer (SearchResultAnswerCardView and co) via SearchResult... We always considered this as a temporary measure, dreaming of a future when WebView would get events and pass to the parent. We planned taking care of this in post-M61 cleanup.\n\nThen I realized that some early approximation of that future is achievable right now, using the just-implemented pattern. I also plan getting rid of SetIsMouseInView in favor of this pattern.\n\nAs for passing also DOWN event, I’d kind-of prefer to not overdoing it. The event goes to a known class SearchResultAnswerCardView, which is CustomButton, and behaves well if it receives only events I send.\n\nWe could send other events, but this seems to be unnecessary work, and, arguably, it could reduce stability (more code \u003d\u003e more bugs).\n\nThat’s my take on this.",
