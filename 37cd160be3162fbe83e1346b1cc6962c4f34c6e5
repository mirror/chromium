      "message": "I\u0027ve folded it into the previous section and added a comment:\n\n        # These modules need access to GL drawing, cross-process image\n        # transport, and related interfaces.\n\nWhat\u0027s the desired level of granularity for these checks? For example, I have a pending change that wants to use gfx::GpuFence for WebVR, and that would need another edit for this list in addition to a modules/vr/DEPS entry. Would it make sense to use gfx::.+ and gpu::.+ here?",
