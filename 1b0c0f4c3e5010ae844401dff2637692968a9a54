      "message": "I\u0027m afraid that this might bring back some of the flakiness issues we had to fix last year.\nHow about creating a separate test file, as in this CL: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/827075 ?\n\nOr you could set up all the test cases with different form files, which may require a bigger change but is more forward-looking.\n\nIn doing so, could you also add test cases around\n1) inheriting autocapitalize values from the enclosing form element\n2) div or span\n\nfor more coverage?",

      "message": "Updated. I was trying to avoid splitting up ImeTest because ImeActivityTestRule is coupled quite closely with the test file it uses; for example, to add a separate file for autocapitalize, I had to add an \u003cinput\u003e element with the ID input_text (since it looks for that ID) and also copy over a bunch of JavaScript I don\u0027t need.\n\nI\u0027ll consider trying to clean this up in a separate CL; I\u0027m somewhat afraid to make substantial changes to ImeTest though given how prone it is to flaking.",
