Like, if you have a clean chrome install, and you launch chrome, sign into an account that enables local sync, does it time for your policy to get downloaded and set this preference? This only happens after you sign in, right? I don\u0027t know enough to know why  there is or isn\u0027t a race here.",

It is read as a blocking operation very early in the startup process before the PrefService can be accessed so it is guaranteed to be set then.  We don\u0027t offer this policy as a cloud policy so it can\u0027t come from the cloud right now but even if it can it will be cached and available at the next start just as regular Windows GPO policy.",
