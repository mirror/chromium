      "message": "Right now in the implementation, there is no way to not show these in the toolbar. I mean there was an old deprecated API that added buttons to bottom bar (and that is why onToolbar was here-to support old clients).\n\nAre we planning to make this optional? If we are then we need to see what happens when this is false. Our implementation will probably add it to bottom bar? If that is what we want, are we bringing back the old API surface? (or if there is no API surface yet, how are we gonna have this interact with clients who set a RemoteView and also add this two buttons with no extra for SHOW_ON_TOOLBAR?)",
