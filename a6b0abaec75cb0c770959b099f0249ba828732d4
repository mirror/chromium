      "message": "Hm... thinking about this a bit more, should this be simply named like \u0027SharedSchedulerState\u0027 and document that this is the scheduler state shared by the main thread and non-main thread, in order to propagate the main thread\u0027s scheduler state to other threads?  It looks there\u0027s nothing specific to \u0027worker\u0027 (either in core concept or in scheduler one) in this class and also in the handle one?  I think we keep getting confused by the term \u0027worker\u0027 here and there in general...",
