      "message": "OnProvisioned() sounds like \"provisioning runs, and completed\" because of our common naming in chrome, while this is called if \"the device was already provisioned in previous session etc, so it is not necessary to run provisioning here\", right?\n\nAt least could you rename to reflect it more explicitly?\n(An idea is; maybe OnWasAlreadyProvisioned(), hmm... but not really sweat...).\n\nAlso, do you think it is possible to add another status in Complete() function so that the flow could be slightly simpler, instead of this function? WDYT?\n\nPlease find my comment in ArcAuthService, too, which may affect here, too.",
