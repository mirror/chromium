In other words, should we specialize this for the specific phone? It will have a significant performance impact.\n\nI\u0027ll take any advice you have. We could check gles2, or maybe android version though I wouldn\u0027t know where the best cut off is.\n\nI don\u0027t know the GPU market, but I was going by vivante not being a big portion of the market, so ok to err on the safe side. And if anyone complains about performance, then we can check back.",

(Not sure that a GL_VENDOR check of \"Hisilicon Technologies\" and a GL_RENDERER check of \"Immersion.16\" is a good idea.) Therefore I think you\u0027ve actually got the best idea already here.",
