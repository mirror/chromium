      "message": "Done. \n\nActually, this was done to avoid overriding AnimationPlayer::Tick as it has a whole bunch of\nunrelated logic. However, since I had rebased, most of that functionality has moved to AnimationTicker so overriding Tick makes more sens. \n\nNow, I simply implement an interface on player that allows it to control \nindividual tick values for each animation while actual ticking is done by ticker.\n\nPTAL.",
