      "message": "i think that ryo\u0027s point is that instead of calling this automatically here and adding a NetworkSynchronizationUpdated method to the observer, you should instead just add a public GetLastSyncInfo method to this class that takes a callback that it runs asynchronously. then, your class would call GetLastSyncInfo when its SystemClockUpdated method is invoked.\n\nthis way, the actual logic lives outside of this class and can be tested. these (untested) client classes should just be thin wrappers around receiving d-bus signals and calling d-bus methods.\n\nsorry for the conflicting comments on the last round of reviews.",
