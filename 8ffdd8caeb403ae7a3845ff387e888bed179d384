      "message": "Can you add a comment to clarify what this is doing?\n\ncontainer() in this case is the shelf-container? So |window| should only be |shelf_-\u003eGetWindow()|? So I guess this makes sure that the extended bounds only applies to the shelf window itself? If that is the case, then it\u0027s a little weird to have to explicitly do this. What other window is this targeter being called for?",

      "message": "This is here to override the base class behaviour. The base class would only extend the hit-test area if the |window| is resizable. Shelf is not. Shelf relies on having the hit-test extend above it to facilitate dragging it up from auto-hidden state, without this you won\u0027t be able to drag it back out once it has been auto-hidden.\nAlternative would be to set some property on the base class to allow it to always (as long as the parent matches) extend the hit-test region - even when the |window| is not resizable.\nDo you like this alternative better?",
