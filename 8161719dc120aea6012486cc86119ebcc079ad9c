According to http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/eval_order , the call to TokenRange() is sequenced before the call to MakeSubRange. The order of evaluation of the arguments to MakeSubRange, however, is not defined.\n\nIs it possible to write a unit test for this, and/or to change the API to prevent others from running into the same bug?",
