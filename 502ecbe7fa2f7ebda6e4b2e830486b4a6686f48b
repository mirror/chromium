      "message": "\u003e That SGTM. So, I think, what we want for now is to unconditionally send whatever seed the service has back to the app. There are two issues here that could make this a waste, but for now it seems ok.\n\u003e 1. The app and service already have the same seed. We\u0027re not currently checking for this anyways\n\u003e 2. The service has a seed \u003e 30days old, so even if the app receives it it will later be ignored during field trial setup.\n\nNeeds a comment here explaining what Alexei said. expired is actually still ok..",

      "message": "\u003e Hm, maybe not. At this point we still have the 4 fields, they originally come from https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/variations/android/java/src/org/chromium/components/variations/firstrun/VariationsSeedFetcher.java which is shared between WebView and Chrome. Alexei previously agreed that the gzip field could be removed entirely, but that feels like a separate change.  For now I could just add a comment here to say we\u0027re ignoring the gzip field?\n\nYeah, a comment why this doesn\u0027t match the actual number of fields would be good.",
