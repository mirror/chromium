      "message": "So this means that sticky would jitter right? Because we would update the scroll on the compositor but not the sticky element position until the next main frame. I think the right long term thing to do here is also tweak the sticky element position within the scroller by similarly compositing a dummy node which sets the offset in the display list. We should track this issue somewhere.",
