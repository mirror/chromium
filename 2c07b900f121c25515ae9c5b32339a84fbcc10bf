      "message": "One caveat of just calling tryImportScanEntries_ is, it\u0027s possible that sync of a very small file triggers a retry in vain and aborts the backup even if succeeding syncs could spare enough space for it to finish.\n\nIdea: how about counting the number of successfully imported files and wait until this amount of events are received? It\u0027s still not the best effort considering the situation that two or more imports are in progress, but I\u0027d say it a reasonable compromise.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m understanding the question - DriveSyncHandler.COMPLETED_EVENT only gets sent once all syncs that are scheduled are done, and that number can dynamically readjust. Also, this function is the completion_callback for AsyncUtil to signal that it has processed all elements, meaning it does get called once all of sourceEntries have been processed, and not once for every entry. Or, in short, I have witnessed the following situation that describes what I\u0027m trying to describe here:\n\nThere is quite a lot of local space available, so a lot of snapshots can be done before running out of space. So DriveSyncHandler as a lot of time of noticing the new files - which means it starts syncing while the first try is still in progress. So the number of files to be synced (as witnessed in the text above the progress bar) slowly grows (because more files are scheduled than done, the progress bar also readjusts by jumping back). At some point, the current try runs out of memory and schedules a retry. The import progress bar freezes until Drive has completed _all_ of the syncs, then DriveSyncHandler.COMPLETED_EVENT is being sent, triggering the next try.\n\nSee also https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/file_manager/file_manager/background/js/drive_sync_handler.js?l\u003d140\u0026rcl\u003d5c08d895d20dcde58e3f33ca3f68f52df03386b1 - \u0027in_progress\u0027 notifies of the completion of the sync of one single file, whereas \u0027completed\u0027 notifies of all of them finishing.\n\nBut maybe I just misunderstood what you tried to say, so please do correct me if you were talking about something different!",
