      "message": "i don\u0027t understand these GetBlockingPool flushes. i think they were maybe here to run the SaveUpdateRebootNeededUptime call that was moved away from PostBlockingPoolTask by https://codereview.chromium.org/2770783002/, but that change *added* the base::TaskScheduler flushes and didn\u0027t remove these.\n\ni experimented with trying to switch this code to use ScopedTaskEnvironment, but i get a lot of test failures that i don\u0027t understand. i suspect that the problem may be that there\u0027s seemingly no way to flush only ready (but not delayed) blocking tasks when using ScopedTaskEnvironment -- i only see a RunUntilIdle method.\n\nthe test continues to pass locally for me when i remove these calls, but i have no idea if doing so will cause flakiness.",

I recently converted a unit tests that was using FlushForTesting() and my original patch [2] got reverted due to an ASAN error, hence needed a reland with a fix [3].
