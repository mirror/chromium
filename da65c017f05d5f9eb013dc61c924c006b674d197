I\u0027d like every task to decide how it will respond to db check failing and I want the DB check to be consistent everywhere.\n\nI am working on a patch with README.md for this store, so that prefetch team has a good guidance on how to write such Sync methods.\n\nWould that pass in your book?",

I think it\u0027d be easier to have Execute create a OnceCallback for an internal function that checks initialization_status_ and calls Initialize(), then calls the user\u0027s run_callback if initialization succeeds. This removes pending_command_ and DbCheck().\n\nI think this would mesh well with having a sqlite error callback that attempts to do recovery / raze the db, poisons the connection and sets the initialization status to failure.",
