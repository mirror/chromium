However, the history of the code is sufficiently weird that I\u0027ll err on the side of separate CL (it\u0027s moved around several times, but took its current shape as IsURLValidForNewHistoryEntry in https://codereview.chromium.org/27024004/diff/42001/Source/core/loader/DocumentLoader.h). I\u0027m going to move it above the CanCreateHistoryEntry() check as mentioned elsewhere, to ensure that CanCreateHistoryEntry() only counts cases where it\u0027s actually changing the load type.",
