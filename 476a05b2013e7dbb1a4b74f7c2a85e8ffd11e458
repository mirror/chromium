      "message": "We would have to be careful so that the root does not process an event in a way that assumes the root is the target for the event. For example, it is safe to have the overscroll controllers process a child\u0027s events because they won\u0027t consume them until there is an overscroll gesture in the root. WakeUpGpu seems sensible, but I took a look at ContentViewCore::FilterInputEvent and it looks like that might be an issue.\n\nOn the other hand, it looks like RenderWidgetHostViewChildFrame::FilterInputEvent copy-pastes some code from RenderWidgetHostViewAura::FilterInputEvent which only looks at the event itself. It\u0027d be nice to deduplicate that.\n\nSo there are 3 cases that FilterInputEvent deals with:\n- purely functional inspection of the event\n- processing of the event which can be safely done with an event targeted to another view\n- processing of the event that is only safe for the target view",
