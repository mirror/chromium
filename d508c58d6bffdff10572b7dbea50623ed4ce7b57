      "message": "This file could probably use some close scrutiny. In the old world, content::InterstitialPage owned the blocking page. In committed interstitials world, we don\u0027t use content::InterstitialPage, so it\u0027s the job of this class to own the blocking page and manage its lifetime. It takes ownership of the blocking page when it\u0027s constructed when a navigation fails (when AssociateBlockingPage is called). DidFinishNavigation() is then supposed to clean up owned blocking pages when they\u0027re no longer needed: that is, when they were for a committed navigation that is now replaced with another navigation, or when they were for a navigation that didn\u0027t end up committing.",
