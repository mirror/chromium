      "message": "Why add this restriction regarding threads?\n\nI think one of the nice performance wins we will get soon is the ability to avoid multiple I/O hops, now that protocol handlers aren\u0027t tied to net/. For example, once plznavigate uses URLLoader interface and we can use the new webui protocol handler, I was planning on making all of them run on the UI thread which reduces hops \u0026 removes a bunch of complexity. Seems other protocol handlers like extensions will also be easier to live on the UI thread?",
