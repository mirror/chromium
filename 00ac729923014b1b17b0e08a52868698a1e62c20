I will make the necessary corrections.\n\nHowever, I noticed that old URL \"https://code.google.com/.. \" gets automatically redirected to the new URL \"https://bugs.chromium.org/..\" . So, fixing the URL does not actually resolve the issue.\nI think there seems to be a known Ubuntu/Python bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/+bug/965371 which is causing the issue. I am not sure of the workaround though.",
