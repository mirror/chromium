      "message": "Nit: Given that accountsInList_ is only used once, do we need the computed property? Maybe just a binding would be shorter. As follows:\n\n\u003ctemplate is\u003d\"dom-repeat\" items\u003d\"[[computeAccountsInList(shownAccount_, storedAccounts_.*)]]\"\u003e\n\nAlso, is |storedAccounts_.*| necassary? Could it simply be |storedAccounts_| instead? Does this array ever get splice()d in place? Or does it always gets reset to a new array object?",
