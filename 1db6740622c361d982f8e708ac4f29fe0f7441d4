      "message": "I realized after I left that I should have explained what happened here.\n\nIt looks like this try/catch was here before because using a ContentResolver from a renderer throws a SecurityException. The bug I introduced with my previous change, is that context.getApplicationContext() returns null until after attachBaseContext(), so this was throwing (and catching) a NullPointerException.\n\nI\u0027ve added a note about this to attachBaseContext, and that\u0027s also why I\u0027ve added the if isIsolatedProcess() check. I don\u0027t think we should be even bothering to call this from renderers, since they get their flags given to them via IPC, so I\u0027ve removed the try/catch so that we\u0027ll notice if a renderer tries to call this.",
