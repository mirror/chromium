      "message": "Good idea!\n\nHmmm... I tried this but didn\u0027t work. Worklets can call eval() regardless of the \u0027unsafe-eval\u0027 directive. Looks like Worklets don\u0027t obey the directive.\n\nWorklets share the infra with Workers, so I looked into the Worker code. Looks like Workers can also call eval() regardless of the directive. IIUC, Workers don\u0027t inherit CSP from the owner Document, so I specified CSP on a response for a worker script, not for the owner Document, but it didn\u0027t work.\n\nmkwst@: Do you know how Workers handle the \u0027unsafe-eval\u0027 directive? Is there layout/WPT tests for that?",
