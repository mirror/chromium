In theory that\u0027s always going to be racy, because js bridge calls arrive on a background thread for the app, and has to be posted to UI thread again (or maybe they are doing something even less correct..)\n\nthey generally have no capability to update their own apps. but they are big enough to warrant a workaround unfortunately. :( and this appear to do the trick.",
