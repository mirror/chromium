      "message": "gcc supports this flag starting in gcc 4.9.0. Which gcc versions do you support?\n\nDepending on what pcc says above, maybe we could add a comment like \"-ggnu-pubnames is only supported on gcc 4.9+; some v8 bots use older gccs. For gcc, -gsplit-dwarf above already implies -ggnu-pubnames, so passing this for gcc isn\u0027t as important. TODO: Remove this flag for clang too once -gsplit-dwarf implies -ggnu-pubnames there too\". If you\u0027re in a rush, you can land this with that comment without the TODO part, and we can add that when pcc replies later.",
