In WebSecurityOrigin(const url::Origin\u0026 origin), these were interpreted as UTF-8, but here you\u0027re using WTF::String(const char*), which will interpret the strings as Latin-1.\n\nI don\u0027t know what the expected encoding here is. If it\u0027s guaranteed to be ASCII, this is equivalent, but it\u0027s not apparent to me whether that is the case.",
