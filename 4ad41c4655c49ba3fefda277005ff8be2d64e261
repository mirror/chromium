      "message": "(assuming we don\u0027t just fix [event window], an improvement here would be:\n\nI think there are times we want to dispatch to the menu bar, even when no view has focus. The most straightforward way to do this I think is to add an accessor on views::FocusManager\n\n  Widget* widget() { return widget_; }\n\n\nHere, do\n\n  NSWindow* window \u003d focus_manager-\u003ewidget()-\u003eGetNativeWindow();\n  [base::mac::ObjCCastStrict\u003cNativeWidgetMacNSWindow\u003e(window)\n      redispatchKeyEvent:event];\n\n\n\nnote it doesn\u0027t look possible for UnhandledKeyboardEventHandler::HandleKeyboardEvent() to pass a null focus_manager, nor for FocusManager::widget_ to be null, so there\u0027s no point adding null checks for those.",
