      "message": "Tried these other ones, unfortunately only alpha04 works with canary 4 for 3.1, and alpha+ matches any, so gradle version isn\u0027t high enough. Apparently + is also discouraged since it leads to unreproducible builds and errors.\n\nGood thought though! Hopefully the AS team will at some point make building for canary less painful, but for now, I think we should just follow what the canary package in goobuntu has to make it work for the majority of devs (this one doesn\u0027t update every canary push).",
