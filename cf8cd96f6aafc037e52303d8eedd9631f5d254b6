      "message": "I think putting the sequence_number comparison clause first would make it easier to understand the overall condition. The way I understood it after looking at it for a couple of minutes is:\nThe args must have greater time and either greater sequence number or a different source ID. A different source ID is much less common so I\u0027d put it second.\n\nThis will likely cause some crashes. Do you plan to collect a few crash dumps and revert this?",

      "message": "The source id comparison is first because we\u0027re want to check (args.source_id \u003d\u003d last_begin_frame_args_.source_id) implies (args.sequence_number \u003e last_begin_frame_args_.sequence_number). (!A || B) is the boolean expression for A implies B. Another way of writing this is if (A) CHECK(B) but I thought the former way was clearer.\n\nThe BeginFrameSource makes two guarantees to its observers according to the comment above BeginFrameObserver:\n1. Either the parent source id will change or sequence numbers will be monotonically increasing if the source remains the same.\n2. Frame times will always be monotonically increasing regardless of the parent source.\n\nYes, I\u0027ll revert this once we have some crash reports.",
