      "message": "Depending on how you\u0027re capturing the desktop, you might be able to leverage the stuff I\u0027ve been working on lately: At least for desktop capture on CrOS (plus browser window capture on all Aura platforms), there will be built-in compositor support for I420 video capture.\n\nNot sure what to do about Win/Mac, though (I assume you are using the platform\u0027s native desktop capture APIs?). You also have to be careful about using things like libyuv to convert RGBAâ†’I420 since the color space conversion factors are fixed (and are usually not correct for the common usage cases); so this will significantly reduce color accuracy end-to-end.",

I\u0027m worried that we might end up changing something that turns out to harm remoting\u0027s performance. However, let me think about this a bit more before you do anything about it: I need some time to think about the pros/cons of alternative approaches. :)",
