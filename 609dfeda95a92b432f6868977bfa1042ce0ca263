      "message": "I\u0027m not sure how I feel about this narrative in general. My understanding is that for historical reasons, we failed to apply the SOP to certain resources. But that is not because of a resource vs. document distinction; it is related to history. For example, we properly apply the SOP to fonts, module scripts, and text tracks, since those were added to the platform relatively recently. Even though I\u0027d say they are resources.\n\nI\u0027d encourage removing the document vs. resource framing and just concentrate on allowed-for-legacy-reasons vs. not. Or maybe just under-consideration-for-blocking vs. not.",

      "message": "I agree with Domenic\u0027s statement.\n\nIt would be accurate to say that XSDB is a defense-in-depth against undiscovered XSSI attack vectors (the Array ctor business, long-fixed, being the first such known attack). However, XSDB also winds up needing to interact with and build upon the other defenses against XSSI -- the other defenses being parser-breaking prefixes (which is an ad-hoc collection convention for turning \u003cscript\u003e inclusion into error), and the nosniff header (which causes \u003cscript\u003e inclusion to fail when accompanied with a json mime type).\n\nIt is accurate to say that XSDB can provide a defense against XSSI vectors even when the site doesn\u0027t employ one of the other defenses. On the other hand, XSDB treats the presence of the other defenses as a signal that blocking is appropriate.",

      "message": "For other potential benefits of XSDB, take a look at https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07#section-1.1\n\nBasically, there are interesting classes of side channel leaks that rely on loading a cross-origin document from victim.com and inferring something about its contents. Preventing the delivery of such responses to the attacker\u0027s context can, in some cases, help prevent this. As a strawman example, if the browser implements the Transfer Size API (https://github.com/WICG/transfer-size) without mitigations to prevent the disclosure of cross-origin resource sizes, then XSDB would likely prevent the leak (for HTML resources) because the attacker\u0027s process would not get the actual size of the document. XSDB wouldn\u0027t directly address timing leaks, but might potentially help if it can make a decision about whether to expose the response to the attacker\u0027s origin as soon as it sees the response headers, without downloading the entire response.",

      "message": "I think this is a really valuable point. Our team has been using \"document blocking\" with this meaning for a really long time, and so the outside perspective of how this comes across is helpful.\n\nThe universe of cross-origin resources that are blockable by an XSDB type filter, are precisely those which don\u0027t need to be allowed through by some potential opaque consumer in the renderer. By \u0027opaque\u0027 I mean a consumer that doesn\u0027t allow the bits of the response to become known to the page origin.\n\nSupporting out-of-process iframes is what allowed HTML to move into the set of blockable resource types. As a thought exercise -- if we implemented out-of-process \u003cimg\u003e tags, we could do the same thing for cross-origin images (this is not an insane performance architecture, but it has crazy implications for canvas).\n\nNon-empty JSON objects are in the set of blockable resource types because there\u0027s no HTML element that produces anything other than an error when pointed at a JSON object. Other JSON cases are similar, except that the \u003cscript\u003e tag will accept them, but ought to produce no observable side effects.\n\nThe blockability of XML is derived similarly to JSON, without the Javascript polyglot ambiguities.\n\n ---\n\nSo really, what we\u0027re trying to classify is whether a particular resource is \u0027potentially digestible by some context\u0027 or \u0027indigestible by all contexts\u0027.\n\nMaybe we rebrand this as \"Cross-site resource protection\"?",
