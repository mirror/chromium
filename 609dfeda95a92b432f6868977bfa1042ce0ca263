      "message": "I\u0027m not sure how I feel about this narrative in general. My understanding is that for historical reasons, we failed to apply the SOP to certain resources. But that is not because of a resource vs. document distinction; it is related to history. For example, we properly apply the SOP to fonts, module scripts, and text tracks, since those were added to the platform relatively recently. Even though I\u0027d say they are resources.\n\nI\u0027d encourage removing the document vs. resource framing and just concentrate on allowed-for-legacy-reasons vs. not. Or maybe just under-consideration-for-blocking vs. not.",
