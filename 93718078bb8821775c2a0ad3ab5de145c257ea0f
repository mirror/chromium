      "message": "We should handle the error case as well, and log it with PERROR. Is errno.h available on Fuchsia?\n\nAlso note: this was tried before and was reverted due to flake on Android: http://crrev.com/428934 (DCHECK in SimpleIndex::MergeInitializingSet).\n\nThe easiest would be to handle directory read failure there (I think early return would be fine, since directory read failures should not happen often - curious what morlovich@ would say).\n\nAlternatively we can swallow the error here, but then there is no reason to return boolean.\n\nThe reason why we used readdir_r here was heap fragmentation: http://crrev.com/219023, so yet another alternative would be to make the FileEnumerator more efficient.",
