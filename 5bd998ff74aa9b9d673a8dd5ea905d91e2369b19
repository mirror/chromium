      "message": "Hm, this is getting quite complicated. Right now, I can\u0027t follow the logic of this function; I\u0027d have to look around quite a bit, e.g. what the \"link\" actually means in the various states.\nCould this be simplified by having different IDs for the different kinds of links? Maybe then we can even get rid of isNoMatchShown_?",

WDYT about changing boolean isNoMatchShown_ to something like RecognitionError lastShownError_, does it help in terms of readability?\n\nI added separate IDs for the different links, PTAL.",
