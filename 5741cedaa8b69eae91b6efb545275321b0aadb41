      "message": "If I understand correctly: the default is that touch-exploration is disabled for arc++ windows, until we receive the accessibility event? If that is the case, then the following would make sense I think:\n . On exo window creation (in exo::Surface, I think?), set this flag so touch-exploration is disabled (or consult the profile).\n . On AccessibilityEvent [1], find the Window (Windows?) associated with the package/task, and remove the flag (or turn the flag off).\n\nLooking at the code more closely, it doesn\u0027t look like there\u0027s currently a good way of getting the Window(s) associated with a package/task. So this may be more involved than I think. Also, the code in components/exo probably doesn\u0027t know about profile?\n\nSo I guess I don\u0027t really have any suggestion that doesn\u0027t involve some amount of additional work. I am not sure if that\u0027s going to be really worth it though. So I guess this lgtm?\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/chromeos/arc/accessibility/arc_accessibility_helper_bridge.cc?l\u003d243",
