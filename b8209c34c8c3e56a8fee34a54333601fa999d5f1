Is it or the rest of the enums described somewhere?\n\nOne particular question re the new addition is that it seems to suggest a model a bit more involved than what we target for our \"User Activation\" project.  IIUC, as if we need to differentiate between a user gesture in this document vs its subframe.  Am I missing something around autoplay?",

I\u0027m just using what\u0027s currently in the code base at the moment to kick things.\n\nThe difference between kDocumentUserGestureRequired and kUserGestureRequired is that the former would use the sticky bit and the latter the \"real time\" one. The kUserGestureRequired is the default on Android nowadays and is using the current UserGestureIndicator path.\n\n@Mustaq, what do you see as more involved than the User Activation project?\n@Daniel, a started might be https://crbug.com/696617",

      "message": "Thanks for explaining the diffs here and in our 1:1. I am taking back my comment about things possibly getting involved.\n\nThe main source of my confusion was our existing user gesture code: we have some historical crafts (like DocumentUserGestureToken class which adds nothing to the base class) that I am currently cleaning up.  From that perspective, I wrongly assumed that your new enum here implies a document-vs-non-document distinction!\n\nTo avoid future confusions, can we please clarify the enum and associated policy string here?  E.g. something like\ns/kDocumentUserGestureRequired/kStickyUserActivationRequired/ ?\n\nAny chance we can align the previous enums/strings too with our new plan? I am not sure how much of those are exposed, so can\u0027t judge the compat risk at all.  Correct me if this is impossible.",
