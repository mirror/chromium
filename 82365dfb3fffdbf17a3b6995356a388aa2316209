      "message": "The spec says \"[Networking] task source is used for features that trigger in response to network activity.\". I believe that this falls into the category.\n\nI also think that the spec around task sources is intentionally worded liberally in many places, so we have a great deal of flexibility when choosing task sources. I think that we should avoid using UnspecedLoading/UnspecedTimer task types wherever possible, even when spec does not explicitly mentions a task source for a particular task (but, of course, we should abide the spec when it explicitly tells us to use a specific task source). In other words, I propose to follow the spirit of the spec instead of the letter of it.",

(I think the answer would be no.)\n\nMaybe shall we ask mlamouri@? He should have expertise on the spec side.\n\nIn general, I want to figure out a general guideline for how to handle unspeced tasks; i.e., whether it\u0027s okay to use speced task sources or we should stick to using UnspecedXXX task sources. I\u0027m leaning toward the latter approach.",
