      "message": "This change is no longer needed, so I removed it. We no longer uninstall the Webstore since I found out that this would disable installing anything from it when it\u0027s open in a tab. We no simply overwrite its \"display_in_launcher\" property to be false on ARC devices.\n\nHowever, this approaches causes other test failures in sync tests. The \n\nASSERT_TRUE(AllProfilesHaveSameApps());\n\nfails even before the test starts. It complains that \"Apps for profile \u003c...\u003e  are not valid\". It seems that this change results in some zero-length string ordinals! https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/sync/base/ordinal.h?type\u003dcs\u0026q\u003dOrdinal%3CTraits%3E::IsValidOrdinalBytes\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d354\n\nI have no idea what that means or where it is coming from. Could you please provide some guidance?",
