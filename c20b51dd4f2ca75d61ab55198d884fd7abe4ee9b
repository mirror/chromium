      "message": "This change is no longer needed, so I removed it. We no longer uninstall the Webstore since I found out that this would disable installing anything from it when it\u0027s open in a tab. We no simply overwrite its \"display_in_launcher\" property to be false on ARC devices.\n\nHowever, this approaches causes other test failures in sync tests. The \n\nASSERT_TRUE(AllProfilesHaveSameApps());\n\nfails even before the test starts. It complains that \"Apps for profile \u003c...\u003e  are not valid\". It seems that this change results in some zero-length string ordinals! https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/sync/base/ordinal.h?type\u003dcs\u0026q\u003dOrdinal%3CTraits%3E::IsValidOrdinalBytes\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d354\n\nI have no idea what that means or where it is coming from. Could you please provide some guidance?",

      "message": "Hmm, not sure. Poking around, it looks like the sync tests complains if any of the extensions are \"invalid\", aka empty ordinal. And it seems you have a default app that is invalid. I don\u0027t know why we throw up our hands at invalid apps, maybe they cannot accurately perform the Equals check? Maybe we want to make sure they\u0027re synced \"correctly\"? I don\u0027t have much domain specific knowledge here.\n\nTesting this locally, it seems that the extension id for the offending app is ahfgeienlihckogmohjhadlkjgocpleb, where both https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/extensions/chrome_app_sorting.cc?gsn\u003dGetPageOrdinal\u0026l\u003d384 and https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/extensions/chrome_app_sorting.cc?gsn\u003dGetAppLaunchOrdinal\u0026l\u003d301 are failing their lookups.\n\nIt seems like this app is getting added to this list through https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/sync/test/integration/sync_app_helper.cc?l\u003d98 , my first question I guess is should GenerateInstalledExtensionsSet() be returning this thing?",
