      "message": "Caching.\n\n\nThis optimization is not related to cache. It was suggested and added in the cache cl, but seems totally not related and a bit confusion. In addition, if move this in if (cache) branch, it is redundant because when there is a cache, the damage_rect is full_rect.\nWDYT?",

      "message": "I think it is actually tied to the cache. Comment https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d783087#c24 tries to explain why.\n\nIf it\u0027s totally unrelated it should have been in another CL :/ But the unit test I added fails if it is not in the cache block. So at best it was wrong before, but we avoided crashing while doing incorrect things.\n\nI agree that when there\u0027s cache enabled, the rect is full. Let\u0027s look again at what the code was:\n\n  if (!texture-\u003eid()) {\n    texture-\u003eAllocate(size, RenderPassTextureHint(render_pass),\n                      BackbufferFormat(),\n                      current_frame()-\u003ecurrent_render_pass-\u003ecolor_space);\n  } else if (render_pass-\u003ecache_render_pass \u0026\u0026\n             !render_pass-\u003ehas_damage_from_contributing_content) {\n    return false;\n  } else if (current_frame()-\u003eComputeScissorRectForRenderPass().IsEmpty()) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\nHere the conditions are:\nif cache + !damageflag \u003d\u003e skip renderpass\nif empty scissor \u003d\u003e skip renderpass \u003c- this will do the wrong thing/crash\nif no texture \u003d\u003e don\u0027t skip renderpass\n\nIn the new code we have:\nif cache+damageflag \u003d\u003e don\u0027t skip renderpass\nif cache+non-empty scissor \u003d\u003e don\u0027t skip renderpass \u003c- this is new\nif cache+no texture \u003d\u003e don\u0027t skip renderpass\n\nSo you\u0027re right the damage check in here is different, we did not skip the cache before because of non-empty scissor. Instead we skipped when it was empty which was wrong (as demonstrated by unit test and causing the crashes).\n\nInstead we can do:\nif cache+!damageflag+texture \u003d\u003e skip renderpass\n\nWhat changed from the original code then?\n\n- We used to not skip renderpasss if no texture, this is still true both in cache and non-cache case.\n- We used to skip renderpass on empty scissor, we shouldn\u0027t so we don\u0027t.\n- We used to skip renderpass if cache and !damageflag, this is still the case, only if there\u0027s a texture, which matches.\n\nSo I think that\u0027ll work. I\u0027ll remove this line. I guess there isn\u0027t a unit test that breaks if DirectRenderer stops using the cache tho.\n\nDone. PTAL.",

      "message": "You are right I should not add it in the same cache cl even though one reviewer asked to add it.\n\nTwo cases in old code will hit this empty branch:\n1. with cache: if there is some damage and also ScissorRect is empty as the same time, which indicates the content_rect is empty? This seems should never happen? Or there is some bug other place?\n2. without cache: the ScissorRect is empty.

I don\u0027t think it can happen in practice, anyways, 0x0 textures don\u0027t make sense etc.\n\n\u003e 2. without cache: the ScissorRect is empty. This is possible.\n\nYeah, this is the bug the new unit test exposes. We still have to draw the renderpass when the scissor rect is empty when partial swap is not enabled.",
