      "message": "Hm, not quite sure I follow. Seems to me the \"correct\" solution would be to have a fake version of ApplicationStatusListener so you can inject the state you want, but that won\u0027t work since most of that class is static. We could introduce our own, fake-able wrapper around it, but that\u0027s probably not worth it.\n\nCould we just add a @CalledByNative to ApplicationState.onStateChangeForTesting? (Does the JNI stuff even work in unit tests?)",

Of course, that will require getting its owners to agree, and approvals. Do you think this CL should wait on that?",
