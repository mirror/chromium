We\u0027re binding both the client and the current thread (see the \n\u003e call to BindToCurrentThread).\n\nThat\u0027s true, though I guess that doesn\u0027t mean that ThreadTaskRunnerHandle is the right task runner.\n\n\u003e 2. Passing in the task runner means changing subclasses and their call-sites (either ctor or \n\u003e BindToClient).\n\nYeah, there are 5 (4 legit) subclasses, but Idk if that\u0027s a big problem.. I guess the thought is if we use this other task runner here, than the tasks will not neccessarily run in order with other compositor thread tasks posted by the compositor itself, since they don\u0027t go to this task runner? What kind of things may happen as a result if this happened during a resize for example? How shall we prevent other things in the future from using this TaskRunner incorrectly?",
