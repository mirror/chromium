      "message": "Doesn\u0027t this mean that if you hit esc, and the bar is half-closed, and then you hit ctrl-f, it will begin animating from the \"fully closed\" state (so appear discontiguous)?\n\nSeems like in an ideal world the animation would just reverse, as with the bookmark bar hiding/showing.\n\nI would expect we could have accomplished that by simply changing the bottom of the next conditional to be:\n\n  } else {\n    if (!was_visible)\n      animation_-\u003eReset();\n    animation_-\u003eShow();\n  }\n\nThough honestly, I\u0027m not sure when we would be in a case where the animation state and the overall visibility are out of sync.  So I don\u0027t know why the conditional Reset() call is even needed.  Maybe this could just be:\n\n  } else {\n    animation_-\u003eShow();\n  }\n\nDid you try things along these lines already?",
