I\u0027d like to avoid having a Profile* in this class.\nWe could pass content::ResourceContext object in ctor of the PreconnectManager and then store a ProfileIOData* as a member.\nIf we do that, we can remove context_getter_ from this class and use profile_io_data-\u003eGetMainRequestContext() instead (should give the same context?).",
