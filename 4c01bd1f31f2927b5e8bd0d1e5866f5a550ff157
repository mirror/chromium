      "message": "IIUC, there is a race here. The following interleaving is possible:\n\n[A component update begins]\nRemoveComponent is called\nImageLoader removes component\n[component update completes, ImageLoader installs new version of the component]\nUnregisterComponent is called\n\nIn this case, we\u0027re left with an extra copy of the component owned by ImageLoader. Two ideas around this are:\n(1) We could introduce a callback in UnregisterComponent and you could UnregisterComponent then call loader-\u003eRemoveComponent. In this case, we might have an race with shutdown situations, though.\n(2) We could introduce a flag in the installer\u0027s OnCustomInstall that doesn\u0027t give ImageLoader a copy if RemoveComponent has been called. (Figuring out the threading requirements of the flag may be important.)",
