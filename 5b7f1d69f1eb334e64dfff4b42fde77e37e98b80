      "message": "For line 222-224, the ARC apps have different logic to update its kHasBackdrop window key, see https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/exo/client_controlled_shell_surface.cc?rcl\u003dba60a6c8aa3d0ad6d4d99615b7c3053e724aee04\u0026l\u003d734, which might result in a backdrop below a snapped ARC app window. \nFor line 229-234, as long as there is a active ARC App window and spoken feedback is enabled, it will always have a backdrop which conflicts with splitscreen. \n\nBesides, I think it\u0027s reasonable to move these lines codes out as they\u0027re mostly conditions for brower/app windows in laptop mode.",
