Since this paragraph doesn\u0027t explicitly say \"The old behavior is ...\" I think that makes it subject to misinterpretation.  I\u0027d suggest you instead say \"On an sync read error, transmit the error instead of a successful completion.  On an async read error, transmit the error instead of just closing the pipe.\"",
