      "message": "Yes this is needed because with a composited-scrolling border-radius clip, the painting root will have both InnerBorderRadiusClip and OverflowClip node, while having !ShouldRespectRootLayerClip().\n\nThis is actually a bug I introduced when I wrote these DCHECKs, this code path was never exercised until this CL. Sorry about that and thanks for fixing!\n\nBy the way, I think these kind of property state inference should all go to RarePaintData, where we already have a bunch of helper functions, but let\u0027s leave that to a follow-up cleanup.",
