      "message": "I looked through the bug and I don\u0027t see why we can\u0027t leave the subject off.  Did you test it and verify that it doesn\u0027t break anything?\n\nLooking at https://developer.android.com/training/sharing/send.html#send-text-content, it looks to me that EXTRA_TEXT is all that is really required, so sending this seems odd.\n\nIn particular, there is nothing to say that apps wouldn\u0027t blindly look at the presence of EXTRA_SUBJECT and not that it isn\u0027t empty.  And app could say \"SUBJECT - TEXT\" if both are present.  That could result in \"\u0027\u0027 - TEXT\" if we\u0027re passing \"\".\n\nIf you can verify that the apps you tested don\u0027t break with passing no subject at all, I would prefer that approach as it\u0027s harder to reason about here.",
