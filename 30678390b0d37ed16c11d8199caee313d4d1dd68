      "message": "I kind of think that the actual API should take a vector since it\u0027s ref counting the locks. However, for this particular implementation it\u0027s really convenient to use a set instead, and check if an entry was already locked. This results in this copy here.\n\nWe could either make this a vector or the API a set, but it feels kind of not the best. I\u0027m happy to hear other suggestions!",
