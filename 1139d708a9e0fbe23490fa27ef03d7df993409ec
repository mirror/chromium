Looking at go/uma-metrics, a bucket seems to be a value range of a counting histogram (e.g., Feature.UsageCount can have buckets 0, 1-5, 6-20, 21-50, and \u003e50). For enum histograms, maybe just \"value\" is enough?",

Just adding a new value in the existing histogram as you do here seems OK, but even cleaner would be to have a new histogram, perhaps with the same range as PasswordManager.Android.PasswordCredentialEntry but with the meaning restricted to the actions taken after search, especially if we also want to capture the other actions besides viewing.",
