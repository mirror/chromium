Once we call EventTypeFromNative() above (line 2074), the rest of the code assumes that that remains the case. So if it becomes UNKNOWN for some reason, it would be useful to understand why/how that happens.",

To reproduce this, do the following: open a browser, open a context menu, start moving a mouse pointer around and scroll at the same time.\n\nAnd when MouseEvent is constructed, the EventTypeFromXEvent returns ET_UNKNOWN for the XI_Motion type events.

      "message": "Ok. The problem is the following: even though the check [1] is false (there is an internal check called IsCMTDeviceEvent, which always returns false, btw. AFAIK, cmt driver is used only in ChromeOS), the EventTypeFromXEvent method calls DeviceDataManagerX11::GetInstance()-\u003eHasEventData(xievent, DeviceDataManagerX11::DT_CMT_SCROLL_X), which seems to be incorrect, because the event wasn\u0027t from cmt device, actually. And thus it goes through that path [2], which then triggers a check (IsLocatedEvent) to fail, because the type of the event is unknown.\n\nAdding a \"IsCMTDeviceEvent\" to [1] resolves the issue as well.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/base/x/x11_util.cc?l\u003d351\n[2] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/events/x/events_x_utils.cc?q\u003devents_x_util\u0026dr\u003dC\u0026l\u003d435",
