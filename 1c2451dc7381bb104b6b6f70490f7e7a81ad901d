Once we call EventTypeFromNative() above (line 2074), the rest of the code assumes that that remains the case. So if it becomes UNKNOWN for some reason, it would be useful to understand why/how that happens.",

To reproduce this, do the following: open a browser, open a context menu, start moving a mouse pointer around and scroll at the same time.\n\nAnd when MouseEvent is constructed, the EventTypeFromXEvent returns ET_UNKNOWN for the XI_Motion type events. It\u0027s this line - https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/events/x/events_x_utils.cc?q\u003devents_x_ut\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d439.\n\nAnd then we we do event-\u003eAsLocatedEvent(), it fails with a CHECK(IsLocatedEvent), because the current type is unknown and that event mustn\u0027t have been created.",
