You could even give it an explicit copy constructor so you avoid accidentally copying it but don\u0027t have to do this which is hard to maintain (e.g., if you wanted to add a new field in the future).",

      "message": "I would think the verbosity of the code here is intended. This class is not meant to be copied and if we really need to then we can always manually copy. I think adding a copy constructor even if explicit makes it too easy to do the wrong thing e.g. I added an explicit copy constructor and which allowed us to copy the |targets| vector without any warnings and also run the callback without explicitly calling the copy constructor.",
