If you browse the existing Shill metrics, most of them are pretty detailed.\n\nAlso, does it make sense to break down individual features from (say) k and v, or is the protocol support all-or-nothing?  I was under the impression that some of these standards combined a couple of different features, and that implementations might support a subset of them.",
