      "message": "There is a valid path https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/http/http_cache_transaction.cc?dr\u0026l\u003d1775 where a HEAD transaction wants to invalidate the existing entry. Since we are replacing DoneWritingToEntry with DoneWithEntry, HasDependentTransactions should no longer return a false for HEAD. These conditions were earlier added because of the assumption that HEAD transactions never invalidate an existing entry.\nMerging DoneWritingToEntry calls in DoneWithEntry is proving helpful to figure out such cases and treat all paths consistently through this one function",

But it raises the concern that the test is passing but flaky if there\u0027s asynchrony behind the scenes and we just happen to be winning the race.  Could you take a look and convince yourself that that isn\u0027t the case?",
