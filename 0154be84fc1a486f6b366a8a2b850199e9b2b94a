      "message": "Using a raw structure like this is likely what has lead to the problem in the first place. SkColorType/SkAlphaType are enums with no type. I believe this means the actual type is platform specific. It may be possible to end up with a signed value on some platforms, which would mean the comparison you are adding isn\u0027t enough (also check \u003c 0). I believe in general we don\u0027t write out raw data like this, rather we manually write each member of the struct. This would likely force a trait for the enum which would force adding the error checking you are adding here.",
