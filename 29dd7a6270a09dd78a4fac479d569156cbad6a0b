      "message": "I think we said that we also need some way of avoiding these situations (checkerboard animations / missing hi-res). @Sunny, I didn\u0027t come across any clues about the ad-hoc mechanism to prepare tiles during draw you mentioned. Did you have a chance to check if that\u0027s still around somewhere?\n\nIf not, any alternative suggestions? Maybe we could wait for ready_to_draw again (and then try drawing another time) if this happens, i.e. trigger the current BeginFrame\u0027s deadline again later? Thanks!",
