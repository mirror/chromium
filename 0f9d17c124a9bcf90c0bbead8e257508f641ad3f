      "message": "Matt, I am applying your suggestion here.\nI think there\u0027s a race condition. If after we read |connection_type_| here on a user thread, NCT sets it in OnInitialConnectionType() on NCT\u0027s thread at the same time, won\u0027t we be in trouble?\n\nIs there another way of writing this to make it thread safe?",

      "message": "You are correct, we will be in trouble, which is why it needs to be checked again after we grab the lock.  This is a fairly standard when using this pattern (Not saying you should have been familiar with it, just that it may seem a bit unexpected, but it\u0027s a common thing to do).",
