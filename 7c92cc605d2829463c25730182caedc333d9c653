      "message": "This is the first real Painter inheritance which differs slightly from the pattern used in other painters (e.g., ObjectPainter isn\u0027t a superclass of all painters). I think your approach is good but I\u0027d like to have all of the painter classes use one pattern if possible. WDYT of making BoxPainter store a LayoutBox\u0026 member and just instantiate a BoxModelObjectPainter when needed? Or is this approach needed for your final design?",
