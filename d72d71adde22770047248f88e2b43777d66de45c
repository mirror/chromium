How to avoid O(n²) and visit the container\u0027s children only once?\n\nWe can reduce complexity as O(N * LogN) by using sorted candidate list. But this change requires additional O(N) space. I think we should improve correctness first and think about optimization later. This CL is fast and not consumes space too much in practice. Also I expect that this can cover hundreds of \"bad\" containers in reasonable time(few seconds).\n\n\u003e Could we have FindFocusCandidateInContainer not return any such \"bad\" (\u003dnon-navigable) containers? In FindFocusCandidateInContainer I imagine:\n\nWe should traverse all child of a container for decision whether the container is bad or not. But FindFocusCandidateInContainer never traverses a child element of a container. So your idea requires additional time for each FindFocusCandidateInContainer.",
