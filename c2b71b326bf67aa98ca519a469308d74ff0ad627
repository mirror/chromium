      "message": "I\u0027m finding the list-of-rotation-actions code confusing. I have a hard time reasoning about what actions will actually happen on which views. I think I understand why they are RepeatingCallback, but I\u0027m not certain.\n\nIs there a way to do this more explicitly/imperatively, perhaps by caching pointers to all the various padding views you need to modify and having an explicit Refresh() or Update() method?",

      "message": "I originally maintained a list of all MultiSizedView instances and changed their preferred size on rotation. This works fine for almost every instance *except* for the horizontal margins in medium density layout, which changes flex weights.\n\nI prefer keeping the layout logic fully contained within this function (CreateMediumDensityLayout). I admit that having the rotation action abstraction is complex and harder to reason about, but I think having the code local is a worthwhile win. Otherwise, the Refresh/Update method will have to try to determine the active density, and then modify layout based on that. Random views will be cached, sometimes null, sometimes valid - this is an issue specifically for this AddRotationAction section, since it doesn\u0027t fit into the MultiSizedView mold.\n\nAs for RepeatingCallback, the callbacks are executed whenever there is a rotation event. The view hierarchy is setup only once, and after a rotation some weights/sizes are changed and then a Layout() happens.\n\nIf you feel strongly this is the wrong approach, I can do it more explicitly. I\u0027m primarily concerned that the code will become spaghetti in a few years because layout logic is placed in random locations.",
