      "message": "No |ContentView.onSizeChanged()| event had been occurring here before https://crrev.com/c/752963, but the CL added this line with an intention to have the browser controls size change get reflected in content layer. It turns out that ChromeFullscreenManager momentarily had |conrolsResizeView| set to true, top control size set to non-zero value at this point. It was harmless since the info got immediately updated to the correct state, but the CL calling |setSize()| inadvertently asked content layer to trigger resizing, which in turn picks up the wrong size (view height smaller by the top control size) for Webapp/CCT activity. \n\n\nIt doesn\u0027t explain why the bug is shown on news.google.com but not on other site though. I chose a simple remedy of removing this line. This is as good as reverting to the way it had worked before the CL in terms of resize triggering. I verified this change fixes the bug.",
