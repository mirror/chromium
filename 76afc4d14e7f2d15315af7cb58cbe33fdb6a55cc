      "message": "Should we DCHECK(IsClientHintsAllowed()) here?\n\nNaive question- why don\u0027t we check it here and return without doing anything if it\u0027s false (rather than checking it in the callsites)? Is it because in some cases we also want to do other thing like histogram counting before calling this?",

      "message": "I think you are right. It\u0027s simpler to move the checks there. Done.\nUpdating the UseCounter when the feature was used on non-secure context should not matter, I guess since it reflects that the origin is trying to use the feature.",
