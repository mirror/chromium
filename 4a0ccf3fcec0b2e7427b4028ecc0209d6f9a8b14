I\u0027m certainly not qualified to review any code that uses it (And I\u0027ve even introduced uses of it myself in the past), so it makes code much less accessible.",

      "message": "Doesn\u0027t it do the opposite? It makes the test code more self-contained, because each unit test fully encapsulates the behavior of the mocked object, as opposed to the current test code where you need to look at the top of the file to see what \"FakeQOSCreateHandle\" does and what assertions it makes.\n\nAlso, it\u0027s reasonable to expect chromium developers to be familiar with GMock/GTest, and it\u0027s well-documented, so I don\u0027t see this as making the code less accessible.",

      "message": "It makes the test case less contained, as you need to know gmock, as opposed to just C++ and gtest.  Gmock may be well documented (Though I\u0027d disagree), but the syntax is far from straightforward, and tests are much more difficult to debug when half the logic is buried in gmock.\n\nMoreover, it adds a significant burden to starting hacking on Chrome.",
