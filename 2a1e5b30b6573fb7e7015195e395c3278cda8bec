      "message": "Honestly I\u0027m not a big fan of it. We have now |request| and |file_request| and two callbacks |callback| and |authorize_callback| which do not IMHO improve readability here, as the code logic is simple. As for naming, |authorize_callback| is called even for a function which doesn\u0027t do authorization (FilesGetRequest). IMHO the original code was simple.\n\nIf you feel very strong about the refactoring, I won\u0027t block. But let\u0027s do some minor tweaks to make it simpler, eg. can we remove |file_request| and write directly to request? And a better name for |authorize_callback|?",
