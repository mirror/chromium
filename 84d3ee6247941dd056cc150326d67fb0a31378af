      "message": "This is referenced inside LayoutImage::ImageChanged() which can be called inside NotifyObservers().\n\n(*A) Therefore, this block should be moved at least before Line 468 (i.e. before NotifyObservers()).\n\n(*B) Probably this block should be moved earlier (e.g. the head of this UpdateImage() method), because currently ImageChanged() can be also called from ImageResourceObserver::AddObserver().\nOtherwise, if we early-exit UpdateImage() at Line 441 and then AddObserver() is called, has_device_pixel_ratio_header_value_ is referenced (in ImageChanged() called from AddObserver()) before this block is executed. (I\u0027m not so sure whether this has real observable impact though)\n\nAlternatively to (*B), we might want to modify AddObserver() in a separate CL (e.g. only call UpdateImage() only when IsLoaded() is true; I feel this is a little cleaner in terms of ImageResourceContent implementation, but not so sure about its implication and behavior changes).\n(Even in this case, (*A) should be done)",
