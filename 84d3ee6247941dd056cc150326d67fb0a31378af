      "message": "This is referenced inside LayoutImage::ImageChanged() which can be called inside NotifyObservers().\n\n(*A) Therefore, this block should be moved at least before Line 468 (i.e. before NotifyObservers()).\n\n(*B) Probably this block should be moved earlier (e.g. the head of this UpdateImage() method), because currently ImageChanged() can be also called from ImageResourceObserver::AddObserver().\nOtherwise, if we early-exit UpdateImage() at Line 441 and then AddObserver() is called, has_device_pixel_ratio_header_value_ is referenced (in ImageChanged() called from AddObserver()) before this block is executed. (I\u0027m not so sure whether this has real observable impact though)\n\nAlternatively to (*B), we might want to modify AddObserver() in a separate CL (e.g. only call UpdateImage() only when IsLoaded() is true; I feel this is a little cleaner in terms of ImageResourceContent implementation, but not so sure about its implication and behavior changes).\n(Even in this case, (*A) should be done)",

      "message": "I think this should be updated at the same time that the Image is created - or at the very latest after the size of the image becomes known. Since this value affects the size used for image layout, setting it too late might lead to layout glitches. Maybe updating it in CreateImage would be reasonable?",
