      "message": "Do we still need to make auth request using the webview\u0027s storage partition? We initially did this because we need gaia cookies for manual auth flow. Since manual auth flow goes away, I wonder whether this is still needed.\n\nThat part that I am not sure is the active directory code path. It seems also not needing the cookies. If that is the case, we can get rid of |storage_partition_| and use request context from |profile|. Also get rid of the \"persist:\" prefix in arc support host page.",
