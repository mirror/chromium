      "message": "Maybe do a non-SSL test, too?  Looks exactly the same, except ssl_start should be -1, and use TYPE_HTTP to start the server.\n\nAnd a proxy test (admittedly, not too exciting, but at least we\u0027ll be exercising that path in blink).  See https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/net/network_context_configuration_browsertest.cc?q\u003dnetworkcontextconfi\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d170 for setting up a proxy (We only care about the kProfile case).  Once a (non-SSL) test server is set up as the proxy, just requests a random HTTP URL, and include the standard set of timing checks.\n\nAlso, maybe an FTP test?  Not too exciting, but I\u0027d like the no-times case tested.  Could use about:blank or a chrome URL instead, to exercise a path we care about more.\n\nThe preconnect / socket reuse cases seem a bit less interesting, and more flake prone with real requests, so can skip those.",
