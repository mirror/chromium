      "message": "I think the command buffer guarantees that GetGraphicsResetStatusKHR will keep returning UNKNOWN_CONTEXT_RESET, but in general the KHR_robustness spec only guarantees it will be returned once. Therefore this may not be a reliable way of detecting that the context has been lost. Please double check these code paths, and write tests using the WEBGL_lose_context debugging extension.",
