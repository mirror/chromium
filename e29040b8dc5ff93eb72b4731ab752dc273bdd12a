      "message": "So I *think* here we also need to check whether there\u0027s a sad tab, and call SadTabView::AttachToWebView(). I\u0027m thinking: what if there are two crashed tabs? Here we could switch from one crashed webcontents to the other, but we\u0027d keep the overlay view from the original crashed webcontents.\n\nIn general, I think we\u0027d need to check or do \"something\" whenever we call SetWebContents -- e.g. maybe the calls to SetWebContents(nullptr) should clear out any existing crashed overlay view as well (maybe WebView should do this automatically rather than just making the overlay hidden).",
