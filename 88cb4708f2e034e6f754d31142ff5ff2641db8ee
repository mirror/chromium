      "message": "I find the first sentence a bit confusing, specifically around what \"the throttle\" is.  There are a couple of relevant things that could be called throttles from this piece of code.  Identify which one you\u0027re talking about with a class name? \n\nAlso (IIUC, which I\u0027m not sure I do), it\u0027s not that the throttle is calling into this object so much as a call from this object into the throttle has resulted in the destruction of this object.  If that\u0027s accurate, could you rephrase the comment?",

      "message": "Updated the comment.\n\n\u003e Also (IIUC, which I\u0027m not sure I do), it\u0027s not that the throttle is calling into this object so much as a call from this object into the throttle has resulted in the destruction of this object.  If that\u0027s accurate, could you rephrase the comment?\n\nThe \"throttle\" (I use it to mean BrowserURLLoaderThrottle owned by |url_loader_throttle_holder_|) could run some asynchronous callback, which calls into its delegate, i.e., |url_loader_throttle_holder_|, and lead to the destruction of this object. In that case, this object doesn\u0027t call into the \"throttle\".\n\nThe whole point is to reduce the complexity for \"throttle\" -- it shouldn\u0027t need to worry about it being destroyed synchronously by any delegate calls.",
