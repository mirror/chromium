      "message": "I find the first sentence a bit confusing, specifically around what \"the throttle\" is.  There are a couple of relevant things that could be called throttles from this piece of code.  Identify which one you\u0027re talking about with a class name? \n\nAlso (IIUC, which I\u0027m not sure I do), it\u0027s not that the throttle is calling into this object so much as a call from this object into the throttle has resulted in the destruction of this object.  If that\u0027s accurate, could you rephrase the comment?",
