      "message": "I skimmed through the CL, sorry didn\u0027t get to depth.\nAre you relying on the fact that the web contents will get a \"resize\" event at the end of loading, at which point you are loading?\nI used to rely on this too, but discovered that resizing event is not guaranteed to come. IIRC, it may not come if the previous contents of the card has same dimensions as the new contents.\nDoes you CL do something to guarantee the ResizeDueToAutoResize event?\n\nThanks!",
