      "message": "The code goes in the right direction now, but I still have several doubts.\n1- this is perhaps spec related, but I don\u0027t think \"legacy || [ left | right | center ] \" makes sense because it allows \"center legacy\". I think \"legacy\" must be always in the first place.\n   - Perhaps we should file a spec issue about this.\n2- Assuming the spec editors agree on the issue 1, we should check and consume first the legacy keyword.\n3- The current code does not consider there is a keyword after \"legacy\", eg \"legacy center\"",
