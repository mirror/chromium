      "message": "Please move this operator\u003c\u003c() out of the production code.\n\nThere is a risk that it could be used for serialization, and then we end up with an unexpected dependency with the enum numerical value.\n\nTo handle this, how about instead:\n\nIf it is needed in a number of test files, extract the declaration/definition to a *unittest.h file. For an example see [1]\n\nWhen extracting it, we can either represent it as a global operator\u003c\u003c(), or my preference is as a PrintTo() function (since that prevents using operator\u003c\u003c). For example of PrintTo() see [2].\n\nIf it is only used in one or two places in tests, then I suggest changing the test instead. For instance instead of:\n\nEXPECT_EQ(a, b);\n\nCan change to:\n\nEXPECT_TRUE(a \u003d\u003d b);\n\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/proxy/proxy_config_service_common_unittest.h\n[2] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/cert/x509_cert_types_unittest.cc?l\u003d152",
