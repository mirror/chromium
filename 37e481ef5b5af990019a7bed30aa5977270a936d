Annoying, and it may hide real alerts.\n\nDownsides of (2): requires updating various internal documentation about system health to refer to the new histogram.",

      "message": "Good point. I went with (1) because I think there will be alert noise from either approach (the new metric approach will have alerts about it ramping up, I think). So it seems simpler to keep the same name and document the change. However, I also plan to give a heads up to the speed releasing group that monitors these metrics about this change, to avoid surprises there.",
