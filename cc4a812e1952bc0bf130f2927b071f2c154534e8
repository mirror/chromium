      "message": "I looked at a bit at how these fields are used; I\u0027d strongly suggest adding a TODO to get rid of the use of routing IDs here and just to use RFH directly for identity. It will simplify a lot of code by not requiring this ID pair to passed around (and reduce the chances that the fields are accidentally mixed up)\n\n(Usually, the reason you\u0027d use routing IDs is you need to pass identity to the IO thread and back, or you need some notion of weak pointer. I think neither is needed here, given that this is owned by RFH and we pre-emptively make sure to clean up various data structures on destruction)",
