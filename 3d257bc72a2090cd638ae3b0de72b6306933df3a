      "message": "IIRC, the issue with crbug.com/688670 is that we end up triggering a relayout and thus the cue gets laid out as if the controls weren\u0027t there at all, failing the test. So a stable-state has nothing to do with it really AFAICR, except that it may influence when the cue container is laid out (or isn\u0027t.) I think that this is a rather fundamental issue in the current cue layout implementation.",
