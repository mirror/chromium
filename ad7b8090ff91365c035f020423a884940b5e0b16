      "message": "In PaintPropertyTreeBuilder, paint_offset is accumulated with PhysicalLocation() so it is in physical coordinates and doesn\u0027t need flipping. Many geometry data from layout subsystem are in \"physical coordinates in flipped block direction\" and needs flipping.\n\n(FYI, I have just understood the paint_offset parameter in painters: it\u0027s in \"physical coordinates flipped for child\" which will become child\u0027s physical coordinates when added by child\u0027s Location(). I think this is mostly for performance reason because PhysicalLocation() is sometimes a bit slower than Location(). However as we have already used PhysicalLocation() in PaintPropertyTreeBuilder and MapToVisualRectInAncestorSpace() which have worked fine, I think we could also use PhysicalLocation() in painters for SPv1, but we may just not bother it for now.)",
