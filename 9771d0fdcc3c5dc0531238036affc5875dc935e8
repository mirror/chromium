      "message": "Whoops, it actually does - I think it doesn\u0027t include it for origins which are using the default port for their scheme, so I added a test with a non-default port to verify this behaves properly. I think I\u0027m going to get rid of this though - seems better to use url::Origin::Serialize() as the source of truth about the origin string is and change the WebUI to match that instead of the other way around. So going to \"Site Details\" via Page Info will be broken until that\u0027s fixed.",

It might be easier/less effort just to move these view IDs out now into that header. If not, I\u0027m fine with keeping what you have and fixing it in a followup.",
