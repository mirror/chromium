      "message": "It doesn\u0027t make a difference in this case, but I personally feel more nervous about functions that have `while True` or functions without a return at the end, so I would rephrase this code as:\n\n    directory \u003d start_directory\n    while directory:\n        owners_file \u003d self.filesystem.join(directory, \u0027OWNERS\u0027)\n        if self.filesystem.isfile(self.finder.path_from_chromium_base(owners_file)):\n            return owners_file\n        directory \u003d self.filesystem.dirname(directory)\n    return None\n\nAdditionally, in practice here we don\u0027t actually expect to reach any OWNERS files above the wpt dir. So if directory equals self.finder.path_from_layout_tests(\u0027external\u0027, \u0027wpt\u0027), we probably already want to stop and return None.\n\nAlso, if somebody passed an absolute directory then it will be stuck as \"/\" and will never equal empty string. Most of the methods in PathFinder return absolute paths, so we could also use absolute paths; this would also mean changing extract_owners, below. What do you think about something like:\n\n    directory \u003d self.finder.path_from_chromium_base(start_directory)\n    while directory !\u003d self.finder.path_from_layout_tests(\u0027external\u0027, \u0027wpt\u0027):\n        owners_file_path \u003d self.filesystem.join(directory, \u0027OWNERS\u0027)\n        if self.filesystem.isfile(owners_file_path):\n            return owners_file_path\n        parent \u003d self.filesystem.dirname(directory)\n        assert parent !\u003d directory\n        directory \u003d parent\n    return None",

      "message": "1. I rewrote the while loop to avoid while-true, which I agree would make people feel unnecessarily nervous.\n2. find_owners_file now returns absolute paths, and accordingly, extract_owners takes absolute paths.\n3. To prevent the infinite loop from happening, an assertion is added to make sure paths passed to find_owners_file are relative not absolute, along with a test case. (The root cause is that os.path.join would throw away all leading paths if it sees an absolute path.) Thanks for catching this!\n4. I\u0027m still more inclined to make this method more generic by stopping at the repo root. It would not make real difference here in practice.",
