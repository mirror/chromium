      "message": "I read through the bug, but my hope was that unconditionally calling applyOverrideConfiguration() would also work-around the OEM modifications. I certainly have my doubts, and so am hoping some time on canary will tell us.\n\nNote #1 - I had forgotten to call it unconditionally! I\u0027ve updated it now to call it for JB MR1 and above (where the method exists).\n\nNote #2 - I\u0027ve updated to be a bit more diligent and changed the would-be crash into a silent crash (while correcting mIsTablet).",
