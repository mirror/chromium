      "message": "Unfortunately I don\u0027t think we can get rid of these, even if we\u0027re already overriding the configuration. Some OEMs load regular resources (non sw600dp) even when the smallest device width is greater than 600dp.",

      "message": "I read through the bug, but my hope was that unconditionally calling applyOverrideConfiguration() would also work-around the OEM modifications. I certainly have my doubts, and so am hoping some time on canary will tell us.\n\nNote #1 - I had forgotten to call it unconditionally! I\u0027ve updated it now to call it for JB MR1 and above (where the method exists).\n\nNote #2 - I\u0027ve updated to be a bit more diligent and changed the would-be crash into a silent crash (while correcting mIsTablet).",

      "message": "\u003e I read through the bug, but my hope was that unconditionally calling applyOverrideConfiguration() would also work-around the OEM modifications.\n\nI suspect that the OEM modifications are in the resource loader, not the configuration, so I don\u0027t think applying a configuration override will side-step the modifications. On the devices in question, the smallest screen width in the configuration was reporting as greater than 600dp (tablet) but the OS was loading regular (phone) resources. The Huawei MediaPads, specifically, had this issue, so that would be the device to grab to test this out.",
