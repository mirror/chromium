SpdyStream::OnClose() sets response_status_ to this value, but that never gets read, because there is no SpdyHttpStream object associated with this stream.\n\nI would prefer not to record ERR_SPDY_PROTOCOL_ERROR to NetLog, because it would be incorrect: not claiming a pushed stream is not a protocol error.",
