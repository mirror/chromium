      "message": "Ack. The comments on the header need updating* then because they do try to state that generated items have all members set to unique values (i.e. two string members should not have the same value). \n\nCould you also make sure that PrefetchStoreTest::WriteAndLoadOneItem is still working with an item with all fields set with non-default, unique values?\n\n*: They already needed this update even before your change. It was just made clear to me now that I realized this.",
