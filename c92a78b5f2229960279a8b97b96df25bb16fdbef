      "message": "This is a very succinct explanation of an ugly construct - thanks for adding the comment. :)\n\nRe the construct: If the V4Stores are used on the DB thread then could we break them out to be owned by a V4Database::Core object that would \"live\" on the DB thread itself, so that VerifyChecksum() would simply delegate to that object, and all the work would occur there without this subtlety?",
