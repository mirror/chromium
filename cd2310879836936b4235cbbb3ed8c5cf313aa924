      "message": "It\u0027s a little unclear what you mean here, maybe \"The |logical_tile_size| is the |container_size| without applying subpixel snapping.\"\n\nAlso, you also pass in an empty size in a lot of places. You should at least comment that this can be empty, though it\u0027s not really clear what this means - i.e. it would be nice if we always had a size but perhaps this is something that can wait for schenney\u0027s refactoring to pass through the container size as a float. Maybe leave a TODO about the empty values.",
