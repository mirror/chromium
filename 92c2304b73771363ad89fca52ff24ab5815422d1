      "message": "It looks to me like this would be a better fit in OmniboxEditController, alongside the analogous OnAutocompleteAccept. The controller is implemented in part by the location bar classes on Views and Cocoa, which are subclasses of OmniboxEditController, so this logic could go in LocationBarView. That seems like a natural fit, since location_bar_view_ is mostly what we\u0027re interacting with here.",
