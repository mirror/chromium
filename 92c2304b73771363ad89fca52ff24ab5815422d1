      "message": "It looks to me like this would be a better fit in OmniboxEditController, alongside the analogous OnAutocompleteAccept. The controller is implemented in part by the location bar classes on Views and Cocoa, which are subclasses of OmniboxEditController, so this logic could go in LocationBarView. That seems like a natural fit, since location_bar_view_ is mostly what we\u0027re interacting with here.",

      "message": "LocationBarView also has access to the profile and can determine if we\u0027re in incognito mode, so I think you wouldn\u0027t need to pass this value. Better yet, I think you could restrict the search to browser objects with the same profile like you\u0027re doing in ChromeAutocompleteProviderClient.",
