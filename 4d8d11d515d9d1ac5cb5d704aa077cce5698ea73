      "message": "a couple of things\n\ncan just use \"context\" directly instead of getContext().get(). And then not need to worry whether the weakref returns null or not.\n\nAlso need to check that this is in fact an Activity context. So check if activityFromContext(context) is null, and should assume some default value if it is null (false I guess?). But if it is not null, get the configuration from context, not from the returned activity. It will never be null in chrome, but in webview, apps can pass in the wrong context, and we should have a deliberate fallback.\n\nalso also, we should add a TODO here that we should observer configuration change. I know we don\u0027t support moving windows between displays right now, but I think that\u0027s probably coming soon. you can put it under my name",
