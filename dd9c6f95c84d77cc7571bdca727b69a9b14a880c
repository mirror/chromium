      "message": "Like dtrainor@ asked for, adding UMA in this CL would be great, since after editing the feature_list.cc file, users can start enabling the demo mode, etc., and we\u0027re a very short way away from in fact having everything available to end users. The guide for adding UMA can be found at: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/components/feature_engagement_tracker/README.md#Configuring-UMA\n\nSadly, there\u0027s no way of using suffixes in the actions.xml file, but that is being tracked in: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d738246\n\nFeel free to take that on if you want :-)\n\nAnyway, just adding this inline-comment to the CL so that you get the cool feature of having an unresolved comment about UMA in this CL :-)",
