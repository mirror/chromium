      "message": "Yeah its a bit confusing. From what I know:\n\nThis is called after HideBubble releases its bubble wrapper which closes the bubble widget asyncly, which then calls this.\nWhen we use the accelerator, it actually closes and opens the bubble [1]. From my runs it seems when that happens ShowPalette is always called before BubbleViewDestroyed, so bubble_ is often not null when we use the accelerator.\n\n1. https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/views/bubble/tray_bubble_view.cc?dr\u003dCSs\u0026l\u003d189",
