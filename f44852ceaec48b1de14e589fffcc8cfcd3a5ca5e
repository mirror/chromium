      "message": "Why not hold this in the implementation and keep the interface pure? As it is, the implementation will have to give CredentialProviderInterface to ExportFlow and ask for it back to use it, which seems like an unnecessary detour.\n\nAlso, a single instance of PasswordStoreCacheForSettings will be serving the needs of both the export and import flow, correct?",

      "message": "As for why to keep it in the interface: my motivation was that this relation is independent of the actual implementation of both interfaces -- the ExportFlow will always need to know a CredentialProviderInterface. But I\u0027m fine with pushing it down to the implementation to keep the CredentialProviderInterface if you want me to.\n\nAs for a single instance serving two interfaces: Indeed, both interface implementations will use the single password store cache.\n\nSo I guess what you are saying that if I duplicate that cache pointer ultimately in both interfaces, I\u0027m doing redundant work. That makes good sense! :) (I did not spot it, because the minimal ImportFlow interface I add in the next step does not use the store yet.)\n\nPlease confirm if I understood you well and I\u0027m happy to change this.",
