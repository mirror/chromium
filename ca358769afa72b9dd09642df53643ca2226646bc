      "message": "IIUC, this sends an event, which is then caught by print_preview.js, which is then calling nativeLayer to open a new tab.\n\nGiven that previewArea already has a nativeLayer reference, why are we not calling it directly here?\n\nSimilar question for destination_list. That one does not have a nativeLayer reference, but could we add it? Or would that create any problems? IIRC, the design does not mandate that print_preview.js is the only place where nativeLayer is used anyway.",
