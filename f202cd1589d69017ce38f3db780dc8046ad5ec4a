      "message": "IIUC, it\u0027s desired to have these in one of the \"custom-style\" styles files -- if they may be used outside of this file. If we do want these out of the custom-style document scope(?) then maybe just inline the constants below (i.e. is there value in having them at this scope just to use them a few lines below).\n\nThough I think I\u0027ve only got about a 70% grasp on the style custom-style root scoping, please let me know if ya think I\u0027m misunderstanding it.\n\nhttps://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/styling#custom-style",

      "message": "So, this works as expected (at least as I would expect) - the vars are available within any \u003cstyle\u003e that includes \u0027paper-checkbox-style\u0027 (e.g. \u0027settings-shared\u0027). These are both in fact used there (although arguably not well), and we override --checkbox-margin-start in one place (although we could just as well override -webkit-margin-start there instead).\n\nThat said, given that these are poorly named (they should be --cr-checkbox- like we do in paper_toggle_style_css.html) and not well used (settings-checkbox-spacer is used in one place and has nothing to do with paper-checkbox), I\u0027m just going to remove them.\n\n:)",
