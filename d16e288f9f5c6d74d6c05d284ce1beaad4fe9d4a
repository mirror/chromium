      "message": "Sorry, I thought I had replied Friday but I see no record of this anywhere.\n\nRunning a nested loop while manually deferring an IPC makes it pretty hard to find any quick \u0026 easy fixes.\n\nWe could queue incoming InterfaceProvider requests (in BindInterfaceProviderForNewDocument) and ensure that they\u0027re only actually processed in sync with their corresponding DCPL IPC.\n\nOR we could move DCPL to the FrameHost mojom interface (adding the InterfaceProvider request to it rather than in a separate BIPFND message), which is probably something we eventually want anyway. Then the deferral/queueing can happen in a single place, the DCPL impl. This might not be so bad?\n\nNote that we don\u0027t really have the nice (albeit rarely desirable) ability to capture the message and dispatch it later like we do with legacy IPC, so you\u0027d have to manually capture/queue the message parameters, but still that may be the cleanest solution.",

      "message": "Apologies, got sidetracked last week.\n\nI moved DCPL to FrameHost, which was rather painless (not uploaded yet).\n\nI was thinking about what would be the cleanest way to intercept FrameHost messages. Which of these do you hate the least?\n\n1.) Unbind the InterfaceRequest from frame_host_associated_binding_ if it\u0027s already bound, otherwise override the binder method to forward to the testing object.\n\n2.) Use std::unique_ptr\u003cmojo::AssociatedBinding\u003e frame_host_associated_binding_; and replace it during testing to redirect to the testing object (Unbind-\u003eBind the if it is already bound). This way the binder method does not need to be overridden.\n\n3.) Make use of AssociatedBinding::AddFilter (although it\u0027s unclear how we could make this message-specific).\n\n4.)
