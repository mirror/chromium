      "message": "Mustafa and I have gone back and forth about whether or not we should search the common name of the issuer of the certificate by matching a regex, which is more exact, or by searching for a substring, which would allow us to catch more content filters. I left this as a regex for the time being, but Mustafa is you would still prefer a substring I am happy to change it.",

      "message": "I would love some feedback about how I refactored this function. I added a cert_data parameter to include the option of loading a certificate from a string instead of from file. Do you like the way I did this? Or would you prefer there were two separate ResetErrorHandler() functions?",
