And assume that the \"use_shared_proxies\" pref is unset, because that\u0027s what the bugreport was about (as the users complained about not having the checkbox). Then ProxyConfigServiceImpl::IgnoreProxy() would return true for that device-policy-configured proxy. Consequently, no proxy would be enforced for that network, and isNetworkPolicyEnforced() would return false. So shouldShowAllowShared_() would end up with true, so the checkbox show be there.\n\nI\u0027m probably missing something?\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chromeos/network/proxy/proxy_config_service_impl.cc?l\u003d164\u0026rcl\u003dae4243ad0674163805c58540aece0538b1842e37\n[2] http://crbug.com/798553#c17",
