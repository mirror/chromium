      "message": "It\u0027s a regression, not an existing bug. The original CL is here https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/864630. The performance test toBlob_duration.html only use 2d rendering context on html canvas. This is the part that I changed--instead of delaying the initialization of canvas resource provider until needed, I make the initialization happen earlier in createImageBuffer. So I suspect this part is the reason of regression and want to turn it back to original shape. But I could not reproduce the regression on a local machine.",
