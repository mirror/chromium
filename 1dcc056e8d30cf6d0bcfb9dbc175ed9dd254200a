      "message": "Could you explain the code from here to the end of the function a bit more? What is the intended use of it, and in which cases should it be used? \n\nIs my understanding correct that CopyRange is used with sub indices only based on safe-to-break positions, and this code tries to determine a sub-bounding box for those indices?",

      "message": "When the end of a run is included, this code tries to compute the right edge overhang/underhang from the width.\n\nBut since bounds is very much smaller than width (like 100px width and 40px bounds.width) that I needed to add \"if (right \u003e\u003d left)\" to pass tests. Now this was really fixed that this hack is no longer necessary.",
