      "message": "I think so, but I am not sure. I just wanted to eradicate the TIMEOUTs, and this line did the job.\n\nDo you really think we need it in the help string? Personally, I\u0027d love to have a new flag,\n--fast-loose, that runs most of the tests as fast as possible, and tells you what tests were skipped and why. I can imagine this flag also skipping SLOW tests, all flaky tests. If 8mins ever starts feeling slow, I\u0027ll play with it.",
