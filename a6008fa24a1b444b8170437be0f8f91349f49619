If I look up this tag in Android (frameworks/base/core/java/android/webkit/EventLogTags.logtags), I see:\n\n70151 exp_det_attempt_to_call_object_getclass (app_signature|3)\n\nwhich means that the argument should be a string (described as app_signature), not an integer UID.\n\nThe previous implementation (NPAPI) threw a SecurityError in this case but didn\u0027t use EventLog AFAICT (https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/07fe3ade9b8870d8e08f004ae75ba9c0420e86ac); the code to audit in this way was added here (https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/869365302661dbf642e6be8e8265862496dbae5c) but no mention is made of why a different parameter type than the one declared in the Android framework was used.\n\nDo you know why? (I\u0027ve also attempted to cc mnaganov, who now works on Android proper.)",
