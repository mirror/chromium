      "message": "In general, we avoid adding public APIs unless they are used outside of content/. In this CL this is the case and the main reason I can see going this route is to build on top of WebContentsObserver. I think the approach is reasonable, but the method seems very specific to be of more general use outside of content. As such, I\u0027d suggest we explore a different way to notify DialogOverlayImpl more directly.",
