If we currently have 2 active requests, and we\u0027re at the WillSendRequest for the 3rd one, we will get request_count \u003d\u003d 2 here, and we won\u0027t end up resetting the timer. Should we do request_count \u003d local_frame_-\u003eGetDocument()-\u003eFetcher()-\u003eActiveRequestCount() + 1 instead?\n\n\n[1]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/platform/loader/fetch/ResourceFetcher.cpp?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026l\u003d1432",
