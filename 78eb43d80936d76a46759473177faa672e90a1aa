I\u0027d like to try and keep what this class does on the IO thread to a minimum, so that we don\u0027t have a lot of legacy code to rip out when we finally make the switch to using the network service - just delete IOThread/ProfileIOData (And by that point, almost all consumers will be using other classes), and we\u0027re done.\n\nAlso worth noting that nothing outside of IOThread initialization currently directly adds/removes objects in IOThread::Globals, so this is a bit unusual.",
