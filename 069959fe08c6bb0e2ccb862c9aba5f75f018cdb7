      "message": "My preference is to do nothing. It should be very easy to correlate these with the associated NavigationHandle async traces, and adding that metadata will just bloat the trace file size (navigation ones are already used on all the loading perf bots).\n\nI\u0027m also not sure which other traces have the NavigationHandle* as a param to correlate? A bunch that I see just have the URL + a ftnid.",

      "message": "If you want also timing information, we could do the same thing as we have done with NavigationThrottles - define a GetName() like API that observers implement, so we can tell how long which ones takes. We will likely have to avoid making it pure virtual, but having a default name that is something like \"unknown\" while implementing it in our entire codebase will be a good compromise. We have discussed this in the past, so I\u0027m supportive if someone wants to get it done.",
