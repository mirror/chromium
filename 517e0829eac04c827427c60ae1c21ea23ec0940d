      "message": "Note: We\u0027ve found that ExplodedFrameStates can get extremely large in memory due to these various strings being unbounded in size.  (For example, the frame\u0027s unique name is stored in |target|, and reaches hundreds of KB in practice due to ads putting JS code into the name.)\n\nDaniel\u0027s trying to mitigate this by setting a max size for |target| in https://crbug.com/626202 and https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/579031/.  Unclear yet if we need to do this for any of the other strings, but I want to be careful before we add more.\n\nIs it possible for scroll_anchor_selectors to be large in practice?",
