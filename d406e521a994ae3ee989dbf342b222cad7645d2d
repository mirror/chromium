      "message": "In a followup CL, let\u0027s update the comment about page_count in the public render_process_host.h.\n\nThere\u0027s also some places that talk about page_count in terms of tabs (e.g., CloseWebContentses).  That\u0027s probably ok for now, but there may be some bugs with that.  Normally, a process won\u0027t have more than one view for a tab even when OOPIFs are present, but I think process sharing could affect that.  Suppose a tab has two SiteInstances (one for an OOPIF), but those end up sharing a process, for example.  Then again, I can\u0027t think of how that would happen today, given that we create OOPIFs when a given process isn\u0027t accessible.\n\nAnyway, let\u0027s proceed but discuss to see if there\u0027s anything else to do here.",

Followup CL is fine.\n\nRFHI::AllowBindings may also have a bug where multiple pending views (one for WebUI and one for a web page) could lead to a problem.
