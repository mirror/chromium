      "message": "you know what... I think we don\u0027t even need this file to change :). browser_window_views_mac.mm was needed while BrowserWindowController wasn\u0027t linked in. But now it is! So we can just delete browser_window_views_mac.mm. However, I do think it\u0027s worth keeping these methods rather than having callsites invoke the method on BrowserWindowController, since those callsites should work with a views browser as well (and indicate possible missing functionality on the views browser like appkit/vs-immersive fullscreen)\n\nAnd BrowserWindowController browserWindowControllerForWindow will return nil if it\u0027s passed a views browser window. So the old implementations would (theoretically) work if we were to try crazy stuff like showing *both* views and cocoa browser windows in one process. So I don\u0027t think this file needs to change at all.",
