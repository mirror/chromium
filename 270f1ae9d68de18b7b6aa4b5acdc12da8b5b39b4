      "message": "Matt, I am not sure how to write a \"integration-y\" test for having a NetworkConnectionTracker in BrowserProcessImpl. If NetworkService is running, we don\u0027t have access to its NCN for test purpose.  The only way that I see is to have a test-only mojo APIs, but you said previously that might not be a good idea. \n\nIs there a way to get the net::NCN from NetworkService and modify it in testing?\n\n(I can also mock out NetworkConnectionTracker, but that won\u0027t give us integration test for NetworkService\u0027s case)\nThanks!",
