Scrollbar geometries are really only used for generating scrollbar quads that accurately reflect the current scroll state (I think), which to me says that they\u0027re not a state that needs to be updated until AppendQuads happens.\n\nCould scrolling and page scale also merely set scrollbar geometries need update, and then UpdateScrollbarGeometries(void) could be called prior to append quads?",
