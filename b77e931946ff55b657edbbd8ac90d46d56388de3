Don\u0027t we just want a flag passed to V8Initializer::Initialize which decides whether g_mapped_v8_context_snapshot or g_mapped_snapshot should be loaded? \n\nActually, thinking about it, I think we should just set g_mapped_snapshot to either be pointing to v8_context_snapshot.bin or snapshot_blob.bin based on whether LoadSnapshotData or LoadV8ContextSnapshotData was called, and then we don\u0027t need to pass anything to V8Initializer::Initialize - it just loads g_mapped_snapshot which is already pointing at the right file. WDYT?",
