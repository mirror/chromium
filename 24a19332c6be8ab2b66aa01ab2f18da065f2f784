      "message": "Note that in order to add to the serial log, ParseSampleFrame now needed access to connection_, which meant that it needed to move from being a static helper function to an actual class member of BattOrAgent. When I did this, I moved it down with the other class members. The only actual logic changes within this function are the additions of the connection_-\u003eLogSerial... lines.",
