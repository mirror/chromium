When they are allowed to run, it should send them to the backing MessageLoop(ForUI|ForIO) which should take care of running them.",

      "message": "I\u0027ve been thinking about this comment a lot and going back and forth on my opinion.\n\nThe first thing that made me hesitate if that re-enter implementing support in ScopedTaskEnvironment is sad.\n\nBut then I thought it made sense and should be the main mode of mocking time (I don\u0027t think it works for *all* usages of TestMockTimeTaskRunner::kBoundToThread but don\u0027t want to diverge).\n\nBut then... I came back to this CL to implement it and realized one thing I\u0027d forgotten: \n  an important part of the TestMockTimeTaskRunner kBoundToThread API I think is that I decided (and implemented) that RunLoop::Run() should advance time when there are only delayed tasks left and QuitWhenIdle wasn\u0027t invoked). This is crucial I think to having mock time by default at scale as it will allow things that wait for short timeouts inside a RunLoop::Run(), e.g. animation tests could be much faster).\n\nThe only way to support this I think *and* UI/IO loops is to have TestMockTimeTaskRunner take an optional MessageLoop param (or probably better adding TestMockTimeTaskRunner::Types for UI/IO and having an ML member under the hood as an impl detail).\n\nBut then the registered RunLoop::Delegate/TTRH needs to be the TestMockTimeTaskRunner not the ML. So ML needs to be runnable without being BoundToThread.\nOh and TestMockTimeTaskRunner would need a way to Run() ML without using RunLoop.. (really don\u0027t think we want nested RunLoop::Delegates...)\n\nSo... In all this I think the most important is that RunLoop::Run() keeps advancing time when needed and I\u0027m not convinced support for mock+UI/IO is as critical. And even if we wanted to get there I think it requires multiple changes as labeled above so I\u0027m now falling back on this being the right change at this time.\n\nWDYT?!",
