Like items(), plural form reminds us of a generator because it\u0027s expected to return multiple objects.  In other words, generators look like lists, so a name that looks like a list is good.",

      "message": "Again, could you elaborate \"why\" we need this class?  Non-author people need explanations.\n\nReading the current comment, it\u0027s not trivial that\n\n- TypeReference is out of scope of Web IDL types (or TypeReference doesn\u0027t have a good correspondence in Web IDL types).\n- TypeReference is used only in Phase 1, and will be resolved in Phase 2.\n- TypeReference is necessary because identifiers are used before they get defined.  Even there is no forward declaration.\n\nAs I wrote in the previous comment, an example would help readers understand the third point.",
