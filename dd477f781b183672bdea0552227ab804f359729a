      "message": "\"small\" works now.\n\nYou are grammatically correct about \"checkout\" vs. \"check out\", but I don\u0027t really like how \"check_out_foo\" looks. Also, we\u0027re not actually checking things out here, we\u0027re downloading them, though in the builtin cases like checkout_linux we are also checking things out. And, I think there\u0027s value in using a consistent prefix for all of these flags. \n\n\"checkout\" is one of the better ideas we\u0027ve had thus far for all of this. Grammar aside, I\u0027m not convinced \"check_out\" is better. I would prefer to keep things consistent until we reached some sort of consensus that we should change things across the board.",
