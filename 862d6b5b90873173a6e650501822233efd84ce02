      "message": "Thanks for adding more detail.  I was a bit confused by the wording here, especially the multiple \"or\"s in successive sentences.  Maybe something like:\n\nActivates any existing tab containing the url, rather than navigating.  This is similar to SINGLETON_TAB, but searches across all windows from the current profile (instead of just the current one); closes the current tab on switching if the current tab was the NTP with no session history; and behaves like CURRENT_TAB instead of NEW_FOREGROUND_TAB when no existing tab is found.",
