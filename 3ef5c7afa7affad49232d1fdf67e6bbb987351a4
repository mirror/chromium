      "message": "Looks much better now. However, note that the StartMonitoringStreamOnUIThread() only has one LOC now. I\u0027d suggest getting rid of that method and putting here:\n\n  monitor-\u003estreams_[sid] |\u003d false;\n\n...also, StopMonitoringStream() and UpdateStreamAudibleState() could be changed similarly; but my argument is weaker there (since they are more than a few LOC). So, it\u0027s really a matter of personal style. But, IMHO, would make the code easier to read/navigate.",
