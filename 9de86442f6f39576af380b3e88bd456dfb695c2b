      "message": "mdjones: it seems that using a bitmap icon for the compact infobar results in the icon having no padding to the left or to the right, which looks awful (i.e. the text is right next to the icon). I\u0027m assuming this might be because the icons shipped with Chrome and accessed with an ID already have padding? In any case, that\u0027s why I\u0027m manually added this padding back here. Let me know if there\u0027s a better solution (perhaps pushing this change into InfoBarCompactLayout if the icon is from a bitmap?).",

      "message": "I did it this way because I didn\u0027t want to bloat the existing manager even more without refactoring, and I want to be able to have UX play with this asap.\n\nThe eventual structure I want to get to is that there is one installability manager which owns both the AppBannerManager and the PwaAmbientBadgeManager. That installability manager:\n\n1. checks for installability on page load\n2. tells PwaAmbientBadgeManager to show the badge or not\n3. tells AppBannerManager to start the banner pipeline\n\nAppBannerManager would then:\n\n1. check engagement / trigger when enough engagement\n2. interface with Blink for beforeinstallpromptevent\n\nSo I want to land this as a separate class because that\u0027s how I think it should ideally end up. The next step is teasing apart AppBannerManager into the installability manager and the actual AppBannerManager, and then refactoring. WDYT?",
