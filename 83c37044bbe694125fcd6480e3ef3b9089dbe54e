      "message": "I expect it\u0027s not needed. It was needed in the service worker case because a SW can be spawned without any JavaScript triggering it, e.g., a push notification or a navigation. But a Shared Worker requires a JavaScript context calling `new SharedWorker()`, so I believe if JavaScript is disabled then it\u0027s impossible to try to spawn the shared worker and get to AllowSharedWorker().\n\nIt\u0027s probably worth adding comments to ChromeContentBrowserClient::AllowServiceWorker and AllowSharedWorker explaining why only the Service Worker case needs to check for JavaScript.",
