      "message": "This isn\u0027t just about supporting testing. This code needs to run on the UI thread. We also need to avoid creating the factory if we aren\u0027t creating a new shared worker instance -- i.e., we are just attaching a new client to an existing worker. I don\u0027t know why this code wants to increment refcounts in that case. It seems like we should just keep the renderer alive if it has a shared worker regardless of the number of clients.\n\nAnyways, I plan to clean all of this up in a subsequent CL when I move shared worker service to the UI thread. This will get rid of all of these annoying thread hops, but also I will simplify the increment / decrement refcount logic.",

      "message": "Yep I\u0027m aware that this part needs to run on UI thread (we have similar code for SW). I was talking about how the try-reserve logic is given and overridden for tests, which seems to add a little more awkwardness. If I\u0027m not mistaken... it looks we can directly call what we do in TryReserveWorker here, and it\u0027s probably mockable with the more standard, readable way... but it \u0027ll need more changes in the test code.  If we\u0027re cleaning up all this messy race case handling code in a follow-up I\u0027ll be just happy with that.\n\n\u003e I don\u0027t know why this code wants to increment refcounts in that case. It seems like we should just keep the renderer alive if it has a shared worker regardless of the number of clients.\n\nSince we look for an available worker host on IO thread there could be a race where the # of clients could reach 0 and the renderer may shut down on UI thread while we\u0027re trying to attach the worker to the existing one on IO thread?",
