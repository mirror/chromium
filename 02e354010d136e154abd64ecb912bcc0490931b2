      "message": "I\u0027m not sure this is a good point for capturing, it\u0027s probably a bit too early for most pages. The first paint can happen way before the page finishes loading, so a) we might get a mostly-empty screenshot, and b) it might have perf impact, since it\u0027ll happen while the load is still ongoing.\nLonger term, maybe \"page load finished + some delay\" might be a good trigger, but it\u0027s also kind of arbitrary... longer longer term, maybe we can just get rid of the thumbnails entirely. That would make life so much easier.",
