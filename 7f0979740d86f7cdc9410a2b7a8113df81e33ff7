      "message": "I started to think this change might be wrong and even the current SharedMemoryTracker::GetDumpGUIDForTracing might be wrong.\n\nNow Create(Weak)SharedGlobalAllocatorDump creates a shared global dump with a given id, and the dump has:\n  absolute name: \u0027global/(id)\u0027\n  guid:           id\n\nI was misunderstanding that the new shared global dump would have a new generated id but this was not true. The dump uses the given id as it is.\n\nBTW, a local shm dump created at SharedMemoryTracker has:\n  absolute name: \u0027shared_memory/...\u0027\n  guid:          MemoryAllocatorDumpGuid(\u0027(process_id)/(abosolute_name)\u0027)\n\nOn the other hand, the local shm dump guid at ProcessMemoryDump is \n  guid:          MemoryAllocatorDumpGuid(\u0027shared_memory/...\u0027)\n\nThus, the two guids should be same but actually not. I think we should fix SharedMemoryTracker::GetDumpGUIDForTracing, or am I missing something?",
