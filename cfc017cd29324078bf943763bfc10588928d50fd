That\u0027s why the console error line number is 0 instead of 21. The result is correct with Plznavigate.\n\n* http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/frame-src-child-frame-navigates-to-blocked-origin.html:\n\n\u003e The line number in the javascript CSP violation event should not be accessible from this frame because this data comes from a cross-origin one. That\u0027s why the test says \"This shouldn\u0027t by 7\". line_number \u003d 0 is the correct value.",
