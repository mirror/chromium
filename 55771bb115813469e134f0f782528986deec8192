If this log was in PersistentBookmarkEntity::CreateFromEntity it would make more sense to me. But other data types do not verify verison (in loopback logic), so I\u0027m a bit confused why bookmarks goes out of it\u0027s way to check version here. Let me know if there\u0027s context behind this that I\u0027m missing.",
