      "message": "For now we can make this comment: \"only mutable property when the browser process sends |info| for an existing registration. The installing/waiting/active properties are changed by the SetVersionAttributes method instead.\"\n\nI think I understand more. The only ServiceWorkerRegistration JS object that can be referenced from a service worker execution context is self.registration. This never changes so we just create it when creating the service worker and don\u0027t need any additional Attach* calls. But for clients it\u0027s more complicatd, they can be created throughout the lifetime of the client. So we need both Create* and Attach*\n\nI think we\u0027ll take care of this when adding the IPC mechanism for updating update_via_cache for all existing ServiceWorkerRegistration objects.",
