      "message": "this should really have a comment explaining why it\u0027s here. It\u0027s confusing that aw isn\u0027t allowed to use \"content public\" it\u0027s just that in this case content/public isn\u0027t really public.\n\nHmm, is there a saner way to do the split?\nCause even if you\u0027re going to split the java parts, content/public/test (the c++ version) is fine for aw to depend on. There isn\u0027t actually that much java code tehre - it might just be saner to fix it now - what do you think?",
