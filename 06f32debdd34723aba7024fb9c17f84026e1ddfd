Did the bounds checking previously work if the base location of the matrix was the one which was enabled as an array? Should that be tested too? Never mind if the intent is to keep the test targeted.",

This is really a minimized C++ version of the ClusterFuzz test case from crbug.com/736639\n\nThat said, it\u0027s trivial to check each valid location, so I\u0027ll add test cases for that.",
