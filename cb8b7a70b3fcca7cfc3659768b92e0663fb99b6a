      "message": "I am not sure about needing both PlatformKeyEventFilter and KeyEventFilter.\n\nI think we can do with only KeyEventFilter, which would handle a ui::KeyEvent. ui::PlatformWindow implementation (or DesktopWindowTreeHostWin|X11) will create a ui::KeyEvent out of the native event it receives, then it will call the KeyEventFilter to see if the event is the \u0027special\u0027 kind of event or not.",

      "message": "The workflow is reverse: PlatformKeyEventFilter receives ui::PlatformEvent from native APIs, which can be XNextEvent() on X11 or LowLevelKeyboardProc on Windows, and sends them to DesktopWindowTreeHostWin|X11 (or RenderWidgetHost) through KeyEventFilter. So both PlatformKeyEventFilter and KeyEventFilter do not know ui::Event. ui::Event will only be created when the event reaches DesktopWindowTreeHostWin|X11 or RenderWidgetHost layer.",

      "message": "On aura platforms, we create the ui::KeyEvent in aura/views. So the event is not created in RenderWidgetHostView. In both windows, linux, and chromeos, the ui::KeyEvent starts being processed here [1]. I am suggesting this is where the KeyEventFilter should be used. This way, we don\u0027t need any platform-specific code in handling the events once received from the platform [2]. I don\u0027t see why we need a PlatformKeyEventFilter.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/aura/window_event_dispatcher.cc?sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr\u003dSs\u0026l\u003d953\n[2] We would, of course, still need platform-specific code to request the keys in the first place.",
