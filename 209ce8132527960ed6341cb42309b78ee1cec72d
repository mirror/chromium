      "message": "The definition of RequestContextProducer should stay in some public location since it needs to be used by the embedder of the Device Service. Maybe we leave it in //device/geolocation/geolocation_provider.h where it is for now and we figure out where to move it to when we\u0027re ready to eliminate the GeolocationProvider interface entirely? At that point we can see what (if any) other public CPP interfaces there are and where this fits in with those.",
