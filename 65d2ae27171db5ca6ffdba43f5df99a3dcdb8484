I suppose it turns into a tradeoff between those factors and the OS version. I\u0027m tempted to keep the leading, because if we have that, we can treat the inconsistent behavior as a bug and try to fix it somehow for all instances, whereas if we use padding, it\u0027s going to be more difficult to distinguish it from true padding later.",
