But I think these only test the default config where content settings are set to \"allowed\".\n\nYou can try running this test by building blink_tests, and running:\n$ third_party/WebKit/Tools/Scripts/run-webkit-tests --target\u003dDefault storage/indexeddb/basics-shared-workers.html\n\nI\u0027ll see if any file system tests exist too.",
