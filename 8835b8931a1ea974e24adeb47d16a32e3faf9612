      "message": "Why is this in a conditional block? Shouldn\u0027t this expectation statement hold true regardless of the value of shelf_visibility? The checks below might fail if the visibility went from kShelf or kLoginShelf to kNone (the [login] shelf view is still visible even though its widget is hidden), so those can remain in a conditional. This should work:\n\n  EXPECT_EQ(shelf_visibility \u003d\u003d kNone, !GetShelfWidget()-\u003eIsVisible()\n  // The last shelf view shown may still be \u0027visible\u0027 when the widget is hidden.\n  if (shelf_visibility !\u003d kNone) {\n    EXPECT_EQ(shelf_visibility \u003d\u003d kLoginShelf, login_shelf_view_-\u003evisible());\n    EXPECT_EQ(shelf_visibility \u003d\u003d kShelf, shelf_view_-\u003evisible());\n  }",
