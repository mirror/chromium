      "message": "Actually,the caching is probably needed.\nHere is the sequence of UI action. \n1- User starts chrome and we show the IPH text bubble with message \"Find your files and pages in Downloads\" pointing to the bottom sheet.\n2- User might act upon the message and try to pull up the bottom sheet. Here is when we should show the highlight of \"Downloads\".\n3- Instead of #2, user might click somewhere else on the screen or even a back button. Here is when we should clear all the state.\n4- After #3, if user tries to pull up the bottom sheet, we should NOT show any highlight at all.\n \nThat\u0027s why at #1, I am saving the highlightItemId, which I can reuse when #2 happens.\nIn order to distinguish between #(1,2) and #(1,3,4), I am using a 200ms delay to set highlightItemId \u003d null to turn off highlight. Longer than 200ms will mean user took (1,3,4) route. So far it seems to work mostly. I am wondering if there is a better way to do this.",
