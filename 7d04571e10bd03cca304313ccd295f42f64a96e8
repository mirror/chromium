      "message": "This is to set the font size proportional to the viewport width. Basically, 15px for 400px width and 36px for 1920px width. This is to solve the \"small font\" issue (please see the description) brought by the fs-in-tab UI. If using fixed font size, the texts may look bigger for lower capture resolution (probably the screen size) in the same size browser window. So I set the font size proportional to the capture resolution (viewport size). Does it sgty? :)",

      "message": "IMHO, it\u0027s better to show full math expressions in code, rather than a simplified form as long as: 1) It does not significantly harm performance; 2) It highlights assumptions to improve understanding for future code readers. I think what you have meets the bar on both of these. Let\u0027s not have people wondering where \"1.38vw\" came from. :)",
