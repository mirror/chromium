      "message": "It\u0027s strange to see ClientLeft/ClientTop and flipped blocks checks in PaintPropertyTreeBuilder because these calculations are typically handled during layout. Is there a function that provides this value already computed? Maybe FlipForWritingMode? Do you know why we use VerticalScrollbarWidth instead of ScrollbarLogicalWidth?",
