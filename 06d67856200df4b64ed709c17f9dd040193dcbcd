      "message": "only potential issue here is that it\u0027s possible for sources and entries to be serialized into different records, and we do want to retain the sources in that case. consider:\n\nsource a is created, with id 1\na UKM record is cut and serialized\nentry b is created referencing source id 1\n\nin this case, the source a would look like it didn\u0027t have any entries, when in fact they just hadn\u0027t been recorded yet. we do need to retain source a in this case since entry b will depend on its being recorded.\n\ngiven this i\u0027m disinclined to do this kind of filtering. wdyt?",

      "message": "In such a scenario, perhaps we can defer sending those sources until their associated entries are sent?\n\nThis would mean changing the logic to keep sources around that haven\u0027t been sent (and some logic to ensure we don\u0027t accumulate an infinite amount of them).\n\nThe only consequence of this is that sources will no longer appear \"in order\" server-side as some may get sent in later records instead. But I\u0027m not sure we have anything that depends on that.\n\nWDYT?",
