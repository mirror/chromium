While this means we have no coverage of the case where we pause when there\u0027s no pending headers/body read, I think this test is unlikely to run into that situation anyways (And if it does, and that case is broken, it will run into it rarely enough that we get very rare flaky failures, which are unlikely to be investigated).\n\nIf we want a test where we pause after one read, but before starting the next, that would take a lot more work, which I\u0027m not sure is worth the additional coverage.",
