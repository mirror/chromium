      "message": "This isn\u0027t false for cast as far as I know. (See discussion on https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/587305/ -- this comment is meant to discourage changes like that one and like https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/583635/ -- the discussion for the latter was off gerrit, but it\u0027s since been reverted too). It\u0027s true simplechrome, but that does use its own custom c++ stdlib: It doesn\u0027t use the system libstdc++, which means it can be updated independent of all the bots, and it also currently uses something newer than 4.8.\n\nI think we can remove the `(!is_chromecast || is_cast_desktop_build)` bit eventually, and the simplechrome bots can explicitly set this to false when they do all their toolchain overrides, and then we can remove the !is_chromeos branch too.\n\nSo I\u0027d like to keep the contents of the comment. Happy to reword it to improve the phrasing, though :-)",
