It seems like (1) this function doesn\u0027t need an updated index resulting from the cancellation of a drag, it just need to actually cancel the drag (via line 1472):\n  model_-\u003eMove(drag_view_index, start_drag_index_);\nand (2) it doesn\u0027t make sense to pass the |model_index| of the deleted item (that now points to the next item or an invalid index).",
