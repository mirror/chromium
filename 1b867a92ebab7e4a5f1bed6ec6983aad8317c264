      "message": "Since the members of this test fixture are reset in between each test (see SetUp() and TearDown()), the only value in having the call to setInspectMode(\"none\") as the last line of the test here would be potential crash/leak detection.\n\nTotally optional: consider moving this line into a third test case which verifies that mouse events do *not* generate FE events when inspect mode is explicitly turned off. The separate test could look something like:\n\n* Copy lines 382-390 from your existing test.\n* Call setInspectMode(\"none\")\n* Generate and dispatch a mouse move\n* Generate and dispatch a mouse press\n* Check that the count of both FE event types is 0",
