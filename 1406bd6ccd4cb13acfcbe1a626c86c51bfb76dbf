This might cause history swiping to start.\n\nThis code makes the assumption that the DidOverscroll event will arrive before *any* [unprocessed] InputEventAcks are returned from the renderer. As such, it\u0027s safe to just set a flag and prevent history swipe from starting.\n\nIf this assumption ever becomes false, we will need to update the logic of this method to also cancel any ongoing history swipes.",
