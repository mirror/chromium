      "message": "This is basically operational locally, however, many images show as broken even though they work when viewing the static html file locally in a browser, but not when serving through whatever proxy server telemetry is starting up to serve the static data files.\n\nInvestigating further seems like something we could do in a separate change.\n\nAs an example, try opening:\n\nfile:///.../tools/perf/page_sets/static_top_25/googleplus.html\n\nlocally, and then try running (with this patch):\n\n% ./tools/perf/run_benchmark --browser\u003dsystem rasterize_and_record_micro.top_25\n\nand watch the googleplus story when it comes up. Similar is the case for Amazon and many others.",
