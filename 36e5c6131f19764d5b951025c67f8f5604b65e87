      "message": "This should always be true; pushStates are always renderer-initiated.  If you\u0027re interested if a user action triggered this renderer-initiated navigation, you can check if the page transition type is CLIENT_REDIRECT.  Just some conceptual clarification here: the only navigations that are user-initiated are ones caused by user interaction with Chrome UI (i.e. typing into omnibox, tapping bookmark, etc).  If user interaction has been registered before a renderer-initiated navigation, then we typically use the page transition type of LINK.  If a renderer-initiated navigation occurs without user interaction, we mark the transition type as CLIENT_REDIRECT.",
