      "message": "OnMouseDragged and HandleMouseLocation are actually the only 2 functions that call ShowSiblingMenu, so I don\u0027t think the pattern has other occurrences. \n\nThat said, there\u0027s a function called SetSelectionOnPointerDown that abstracts Selection (and is only called in 2 places). I could abstract this logic/SetSelection pattern similarly (although it might not be worth it considering the SetSelectionOnPointerDown case encompasses quite a bit more logic/work than we would need in this case).",
