      "message": "Thanks for the explanation!\n\nFrom a quick look around the codebase, it seems that many of the calls to Notification are still using resource bundle images; if these are also going to be converted, would it make sense to then add this as a constant somewhere (notification.h?)",

      "message": "It might make sense to add this constant alongside this one[1] but at the same time, it depends on the icon. I also just updated a USB notification icon and to maintain the amount of negative space the designer originally spec\u0027d, I had to use 64dip for the icon. I think the discrepancy is because this icon is a solid circle and that one is just a few strokes, i.e. they have different visual weight at the same size.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/message_center/message_center_style.h?rcl\u003df48183740edfb5d13266d34f2471cb7fb4a58deb\u0026l\u003d25",
