      "message": "It will be more complicated if we place it outside //components/arc since Android side also uses the VoiceInteractionState type. I chatted with xiyuan@ and xiaohuic@, can we only let ash depend on //components/arc/common which contains mojo files only?",

      "message": "ARC will have a bit of trouble if we start depending of stuff outside of that directory (and //base, //mojo) :S\n\nwould it help to have not //components/arc but a subdirectory depend on //ash*?\n\notherwise we might need to drop this one change altogether since it just moves where the enum is declared. alternatively, move the enum to //ash/public/interfaces and change arc\u0027s typemap to point to that.",
