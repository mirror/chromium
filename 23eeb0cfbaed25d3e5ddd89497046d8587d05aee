      "message": "Sorry, Luis, I don\u0027t understand.\n\nIt seems like we have 3 paths:\n1. Put this enum in //components/arc/common/ and allow //ash to depend on //components/arc/common. It\u0027s not obvious from the path //components/arc/common that it will only ever contain mojoms. I don\u0027t want code in ash depending on arbitrary C++ code in arc, at least until we sort out how things are going to work for mustash.\n2. Put this enum in //ash/public/interfaces. //components/arc already depends on //ash/public/cpp, it could add a dep on //ash/public/interfaces. The complication would be how this mojom under //ash gets updated if you change something on the ARC container side.\n3. Duplicate the enum in the chrome codebase. Use one copy in //components/arc for browser \u003c-\u003e ARC container communication, and another one for ash \u003c-\u003e browser communication. That doesn\u0027t sound great either.\n\nIf 2 works for you, I prefer that. If 2 doesn\u0027t work for you, I\u0027d rather do something like 1, but only allow ash to depend on the single .mojom file in //components/arc/common/foo.mojom with some sort of TODO to sort out the overall dependency graph between ash and arc.\n\nDid I miss something? Which direction do you prefer?",
