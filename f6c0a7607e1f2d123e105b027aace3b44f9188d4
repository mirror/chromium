      "message": "nit: At the risk of straying outside the bindings area here: I think it is incorrect to use a HashMap here. To be compliant (as I understand the spec), you must preserve order, which a HashMap does not. A Vector\u003cstd::pair\u003cString, String\u003e\u003e would do fine (and be more efficient anyhow, since all you do is iterate, and you could even give it inline capacity if you wished).\n\nI believe the problematic case arises if a CSS property shorthand is used. e.g.\n\n{ \"margin\": \"4px\", \"margin-top\": \"8px\" }\n\nBoth of these will set the marginTop field of the underlying CSS property map, but if they are applied out of order, it will be 4px rather than 8px as it should. (Note that JS objects do preserve their property order.",
