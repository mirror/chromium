      "message": "IfEligible refers to the feature engagement tracker\u0027s triggering conditions, specifically the ShouldTriggerHelpUI method. For example, if the user has already opened a new tab (or incognito tab), they aren\u0027t eligible to see the bubble. If they have already seen an in-product help promotion this session, they are also not eligible. It could also depend on having opened Chrome a certain number of times to give users a chance to use the features before Chrome starts showing in-product help. These triggering conditions are determined entirely server side.",
