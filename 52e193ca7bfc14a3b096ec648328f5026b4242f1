Isn\u0027t it possible that we have something like:\nStart inject scripts at document_start, Frame A\nStart inject scripts at document_end, Frame A\nStart inject scripts at document_start, Frame B\nStart inject scripts at document_end, Frame B\nStart inject scripts at document_idle, Frame B\n\nand each time we call it, we\u0027d reset last_injection_finish_time_ - thus tainting the results for yield time between scripts in Frame A?",

This has a couple potential issues:\n- It includes the time it took for the script to run.\n- It is recorded even when we yield no time at all.\n\nIt seems like the more useful metric would be how long we yield (excluding script run time) iff yielding was a possibility?",
