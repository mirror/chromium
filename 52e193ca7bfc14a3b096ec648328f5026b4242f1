      "message": "Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but it looks like this will record the time between two successive scripts finishing injection.  This has a couple potential issues:\n- It includes the time it took for the script to run.\n- It is recorded even when we yield no time at all.\n\nIt seems like the more useful metric would be how long we yield (excluding script run time) iff yielding was a possibility?",
