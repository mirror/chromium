It is just food for thought.\n\nI believe Windows is now available on ARM. So it is possible for us to support this, presumably. But I don\u0027t think we build Chrome for Windows/ARM. So it\u0027s pretty safe to ignore for now.",

I am unsure about other compilers like ICC.\n\nAnyway, maybe something like:\n#if defined __clang__ || (defined __GNUC__ \u0026\u0026 __GNUC__ \u003e\u003d 4)\n#define ZLIB_INTERNAL __attribute__((visibility (\"hidden\")))\n#else\n#define ZLIB_INTERNAL\n#endif\n\nThis would be a sort of opt-in system, that way.\n(I think VC\u0027s default visibility is hidden anyway)\n\n\nActually, in retrospect, let\u0027s just worry about Windows later. I think Windows/ARM usage is low.",
