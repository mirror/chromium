I.e.\n\nfetch_context_-\u003eGetResourceFetcher()-\u003eClearContext();\n\n(with null check)\n\nUsually ResourceFetcher is the one that calls FetchContext\u0027s methods, having FetchContext methods that call into ResourceFetcher in the opposite way makes me worry a bit as it could make cyclic call if done incorrectly",
