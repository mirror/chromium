      "message": "Maybe a better fix would be to change the IsFullscreen function from:\n\nbool WindowState::IsFullscreen() const {\n  return GetStateType() \u003d\u003d mojom::WindowStateType::FULLSCREEN;\n}\n\nto:\n\nbool WindowState::IsFullscreen() const {\n  return GetStateType() \u003d\u003d mojom::WindowStateType::FULLSCREEN ||\n         IsPinned();\n}\n\nWDYT? I\u0027ve been thinking about this for some time now (since I first started working on the locked fullscreen feature which is basically the TRUSTED_PINNED mode), and it probably makes sense as all three of FULLSCREEN/PINNED/TRUSTED_PINNED are fullscreen modes, but since this is a low level function in ash/ it may break some things.",
