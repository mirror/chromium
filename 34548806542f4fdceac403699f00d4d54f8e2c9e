      "message": "This test previously did not have a scrollable scroll_parent and therefore did not scroll at all. The test would still pass with the SetCurrentScrollOffset call on line 8677 removed.\n\nThe original test (https://codereview.chromium.org/1106013002) was checking that the visible_layer_rect was not updated without rebuilding property trees. A later patch (https://codereview.chromium.org/1870513002) mistakenly made scroll layer unscrollable (stopped setting scroll clip layer) and added a forced property tree rebuild. The test has been updated to check the original case (before-update) as well as the after-update visible layer rect.",
