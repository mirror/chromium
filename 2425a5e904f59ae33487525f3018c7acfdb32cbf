      "message": "We probably should use TimeDelta for duration as much as we can. I noticed that this is returning double because WebMediaPlayer is doing so. But since third_party/WebKit can use base::TimeDelta as well now, probably we should just update WebMediaPlayer interface to use TimeDelta for duration.\n\nmiu (as base/time/OWNERS): Does this make sense? We can land this as is for now to make the branch cut, but it\u0027d be nice to have a plan for a better API.",
