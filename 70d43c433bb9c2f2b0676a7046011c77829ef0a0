      "message": "You added this branch in the last patchset and it doesn\u0027t make sense to me.  It seems theoretically wrong for the presence of height should affect the scaling at all.\n\nDid you add this to avoid influencing the return value perhaps?  In that case, I suggest applying the scale factor multiplication within browser_controls_manager()-\u003eScrollBy() instead.",

      "message": "No. The reason behind this branch is to apply only to the bottom control (not the top control). The wrong behavior is detected only when I enable \"Chrome home\" flag (i.e., the bottom control). Thus, when the top control is enabled (i.e., TopControlHeight() is not zero), we must keep the existing code.",
