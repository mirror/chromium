I know the latter is needed, I\u0027m not sure about the former.\n\nI think the preferable route would be to leave things as they were, maybe with some comments.

CloseBubbleForLastActiveBrowser which calls this function is called from tab_strip_model, browser_tab_strip, and browser_command_controller which all manually call OnPromoClosed. (which now that I think about it, should I just do it in here to make it more similiar to make it less confusing?) Could I just changed this to also have SchedulePaint? However, if you would like for me to keep observing here, I can go back to the way it was.",
