      "message": "ACK.\nThanks for the suggestion! \nI actually prefer to have all the user action handling centralized in one place. But if you\u0027re strongly against it, I can do a small refactoring after this CL landed.  Separating this function into 3 means touching additional code/files, i.e. more reviewers (there\u0027re already 6 reviewer in this CL), additional rounds of review. \n\nWe need to be code complete by M63 feature freeze (next week). And this CL is blocking a couple of other CLs.",
