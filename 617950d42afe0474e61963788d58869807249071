      "message": "My only concern is that the views implementation may assume things to be of certain types (e.g. always expect a WindowTreeHost to be a DesktopWindowTreeHost, etc.), even if not right now, in some unfortunate future change. So I would encourage you to split out the relevant parts of DesktopScreenX11/DesktopScreenWin out of views, and into //ui/display/[x11|win], so we don\u0027t have to worry about this. (please file a crbug and a TODO here referencing that)",
